        "answer": "To deposit a cheque issued to an associate into your business account, you could do one of the following:\n\n1. If you sign the check \"For Deposit Only,\" the bank will put it into your account. This may require setting up a \"payable name\" on the account that matches your Doing Business As (DBA) alias.\n\n2. Alternatively, you could file a \"Doing Business As\" (DBA) document with your local government, after which the bank can call the county seat to verify this. Filing a DBA might involve a fee but is beneficial for this and other business purposes.\n\n3. Another option would be to have the associate sign the back of the cheque and deposit it as a third party cheque, which is a perfectly legal procedure.\n\nBefore proceeding, it's a good idea to confirm with your bank to ensure these methods align with their policies and requirements for third-party cheques and DBA accounts.",

I wouldn't be surprised if it has a longer hold period and, as always, you don't get the money if the cheque doesn't clear.

In that case you can have the associate go to the bank and endorse it in front of the teller with some ID.  You don't even technically have to be there.  Anybody can deposit money to your account if they have the account number. He could also just deposit it in his account and write a cheque to the business."

It's important to go in person and bring with you your business statements, including profit and loss, balance sheet, and a spreadsheet showing your historical cash flow. This helps your banker understand your business and your credit needs.

It is advisable to maintain an ongoing relationship with your banker, meeting regularly, at least annually, and updating them with your current financial statements. This relationship can be beneficial when you eventually want to apply for a line of credit or a business loan, as the banker will already be familiar with your business.\n\nAdditionally, going through this process has intrinsic value as it helps you analyze and understand your business better, regardless of the immediate outcome of the credit application.",

            "\"I'm afraid the great myth of limited liability companies is that all such vehicles have instant access to credit.  Limited liability on a company with few physical assets to underwrite the loan, or with insufficient revenue, will usually mean that the owners (or others) will be asked to stand surety on any credit. However, there is a particular form of \"\"credit\"\" available to businesses on terms with their clients.  It is called factoring. Factoring is a financial transaction   whereby a business sells its accounts   receivable (i.e., invoices) to a third   party (called a factor) at a discount   in exchange for immediate money with   which to finance continued business.   Factoring differs from a bank loan in   three main ways. First, the emphasis   is on the value of the receivables   (essentially a financial asset), not   the firm\u2019s credit worthiness.   Secondly, factoring is not a loan \u2013 it   is the purchase of a financial asset   (the receivable). Finally, a bank loan   involves two parties whereas factoring   involves three. Recognise that this can be quite expensive.  Most banks catering to small businesses will offer some form of factoring service, or will know of services that offer it.  It isn't that different from cheque encashment services (pay-day services) where you offer a discount on future income for money now. An alternative is simply to ask his clients if they'll pay him faster if he offers a discount (since either of interest payments or factoring would reduce profitability anyway).\"",

Bringing in another partner isn't necessarily going to help, either; with only two partners / owners, the bank would probably look at both owners' personal tax returns and credit histories.  It may be necessary to offer collateral. I'm sorry I can't offer any better solutions, but alternative funding such as personal loans from family & friends could be necessary.

        "answer": "For a home-based business, costs for small business equipment under US$10,000 don't need to be capitalized; they can be expensed, meaning they can be claimed as an expense all in one year. This means you can write off the purchase of such equipment in the year it's bought, rather than having to depreciate the expense over several years. It is important, however, to keep track of these costs for proper accounting and tax filing.\n\nIf the equipment is used partially for charitable work, for example, and partially for the home-based business, you should keep precise records of the costs and consider having the charity reimburse you for the portion of the costs related to the charity work.

Some items can be expensed; you get to deduct the entire cost in the first year but then if you don't stay in business, e.g. you get a job paying wages and are no longer self-employed, you have to recapture this and pay taxes on the amount recaptured in the later year.

Since you're an engineer, this might be relevant for you. Talk to your tax adviser. How exactly you deduct/depreciate/capitalize things, and what expense goes which way depends greatly on the laws and jurisdictions. Even in the US, different states have different laws, and the IRS and State laws don't have to conform (unfortunately). For example, the limitations on Sec. 179 deduction in 2010-2011 were 20 times higher on Federal level than in the State of California.

        "question": "Using credit card points to pay for tax deductible business expenses",
        "answer": "The document provides an explanation on how to handle business expenses and credit card rewards for tax purposes:\n\n1. **Cash Back for Personal Use:** Cash back from credit cards for personal use is generally not taxable because personal purchases are made with after-tax dollars and are not deducted from personal income for tax purposes.\n\n2. **Cash Back for Business Use:** For business expenses, cash back is generally taxable. Businesses typically deduct expenses, so if a purchase is made for $100 and there is a $2 cash back, the business should only deduct $98, as the $2 cash back acts as a negative expense, akin to a refund.\n\n3. **Reward Points and Business Deductions:** Expenses covered with credit card points are not deductible because they are offset by the \"refund\" received from using the points. If you use credit card reward points to pay for business-related travel expenses, such as airfare, hotel, and rental car for a business seminar, those expenses would not be deductible since the payment is in the form of points rather than actual money spent from a bank or credit card account.\n\n4. **Personal vs. Business Credit Cards for Rewards:** The usage of personal credit cards for business expenses and the associated rewards is a gray area. Reimbursement by employers for business expenses charged on personal credit cards is allowed, and there seems to be a \"don't ask, don't tell\" understanding with the IRS regarding such rewards as cash back or points. However, it is not advisable to abuse such practices. For substantial company expenses like purchasing multiple items, it is better to use a company credit card or negotiate a discount directly.\n\n5. **Credit Card Points vs. Brand-Loyalty Points:** There is no difference between using credit card points and brand-loyalty points from the company's perspective for tax deductions. In both cases, you can only deduct an expense that you have actually incurred, which should be reflected on a bank or credit card statement.\n\nIn summary, you can not deduct expenses that were paid for using reward points, as these are considered similar to a refund rather than an out-of-pocket expense. Reward points used for business expenses should be treated distinctively compared to cash transactions when it comes to deductions and tax reporting.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"For simplicity, let's start by just considering cash back. In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable (sort of, I'll explain later). The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars; you typically aren't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income, so if you purchase something that costs $100 and you receive $2 back from the CC company, effectively you have paid $98 for that item but that wouldn't affect your tax bill. However, since businesses typically deduct most expenses, that same $100 deduction would have only been a $98 deduction for business tax purposes, so in this case the $2 should be accounted for. Note, you should not consider that $2 as income though; that would artificially inflate your revenue. It should be treated as a negative expense, similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund. Now for your specific questions: Part 1: As a small business owner, I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business. I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare, hotel, and rental car. Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt? Effectively no, these expenses are not deductible. If you deduct them they will be completely counter-acted by the \"\"refund\"\" you receive for the payments. Part 2: Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card, rather than a business credit card? This is where it gets hairy. Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement. In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards/points/cashback. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show, and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a \"\"don't ask, don't tell\"\" rule that the IRS is OK with. It works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline miles- the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income. However, I would not go out of my way to abuse this \"\"loophole\"\". Typically, things like travel (airfare, hotel, car rental, meals) are expected. But I wouldn't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you. The company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received. (Or more realistically, negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check.) Part 3: Would there be any difference between credit card points and brand-loyalty points? If the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company's loyalty system (not a CC), would that yield a different result? There is no difference. Perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur. In other words, the expense should show up on a bank or CC statement. This is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity, you can't call that a \"\"donation\"\" of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement. Instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work, and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them, but it ends up being a wash.\""

        "answer": "Achieving a financial goal of $250,000 through trading, investing, or business within 5 years can be a challenging endeavor. However, it's not impossible with proper planning, education, and strategic action. Here are some well-rounded steps and principles based on the information extracted from the documents:\n\n1. **Understand Compounding Interest**: To maximize your earnings, you need to understand how compounding of annual interest works. Utilize financial calculators and familiarize yourself with terms like Present Value (PV), Future Value (FV), Interest Rate (Int), Number of Periods (nPer), and Payment (PMT). For example, with a 10% return over three years, depositing $900 each month could amount to $34,039.30.\n\n2. **Increase Your Earning Potential**: Consider pursuing further education to increase your earning capacity. Having a bachelor's degree, certificate, or even an associate degree can significantly boost your income over your lifetime.\n\n3. **Start a Small Business**: If you're inclined towards entrepreneurship, start a business that does not require substantial initial investment. Examples can include offering a service like handyman work or a billing service.\n\n4. **Save and Invest Wisely**: Before investing, ensure you determine how much you can save by making a budget and setting aside part of your income for an emergency fund. It\u2019s recommended to save at least 10% of your income for retirement and take advantage of any employer-sponsored retirement plans like a 401(k), or consider an IRA.\n\n5. **Debt Management**: Prioritize paying off any debts. Carrying high-interest debts can significantly hinder your capacity to save and invest.\n\n6. **Learning About Investments**: If you decide to invest in the stock market, educate yourself on different investment options and consider looking into Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nIt's important to mention that the path to making $250,000 from trading, investing, or running a business within 5 years is subject to various risks and there are no guarantees.

On the other hand, investors expect a share of the profit, not just a fixed interest rate.\"",
            "You can either borrow money... credit card, line of credit, re-finance your home, home equity line of credit, loan, mortgage, etc. Or you have other invest in your company as equity.  They will contribute $X to get Y% of your company and get Z% of the profits.  Note amount of profits does not necessarily have to equate to percentage owned.  This makes sense if they are a passive investor, where they just come up with the money and you do all the work.  Also voting rights in a company does not have to equate to percentage owned either. You can also have a combination of equity and debt.  If you have investors, you would need to figure out whether the investor will personally guarantee the debt of your company - recourse vs non-recourse.  If they have more risk, they will want more of a return. One last way to do it is crowdfunding, similar to what people do on Kickstarter.  Supporters/customers come up with the money, then you deliver the product.  Consulting practices do something similar with the concept of retainers. Best of luck."

        "question": "What approaches are there for pricing a small business?",
        "answer": "There are several approaches for pricing a small business. The document provided outlines some key methods:\n\n1. **Liquidation Value**: This is the baseline or the lowest amount a seller might accept for their business. It involves calculating the value of the business's assets (such as land, buildings, furnishings, etc.) and subtracting any liabilities to determine what the business would be worth if it had to be sold immediately.\n\n2. **Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCF)**: This method involves projecting the business's future cash flows and discounting them to present value using a discount rate (typically the business's cost of capital or the investor's required rate of return). For example, if you project the business will earn $100,000/year and grow at a 5% rate with a discount rate of 8%, you can use a growing perpetuity formula to estimate the value of the business.\n\n3. **Multiples of EBITDA**: Often, businesses are valued at a multiple of their annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). This multiple can vary depending on the industry, with some industries having established benchmarks. The document mentions an example multiplier for hospitality industries from 2011, which was 13.8. Doing some research to find the appropriate EBITDA multiplier for the industry in question will help in determining the business's value.\n\n4. **Seller Discretionary Earnings (SDE)**: For many small businesses, SDE is used instead of EBITDA. SDE takes into account not only the business's earnings but also adds back expenses that are considered discretionary, such as owner compensation. It is meant to show the earnings potential to a new owner and is often used by smaller companies.\n\nThese are some of the common methods used for pricing small businesses. It's important for a potential buyer to request the financial statements of the business for the past few years to perform a more accurate valuation and then negotiate with the seller. Additionally, it may be beneficial to enlist the help of a broker to assist with the transaction.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "I don't have any experience in this, but this is my academic understanding of business pricing.  The LOWEST amount a seller would accept is the liquidation value. For a B&B, what would the value of the land, the house, the furnishings, accounts payable, etc. be if it had to be sold today, minus any liabilities.  The amount the seller would like to pay for is going to be a multiple of its annual earnings. One example of this is the discounted cash flow analysis. You determine the EBITDA, the earnings a company generated, before interest,  depreciation, taxation and amortization.  Once you have this amount, you can project it out in perpetuity, or you use an industry multiplier.  Perpetuity:  You project this value out in perpituity, discounted by the going interest rate. In other words, if you project the business will earn $100,000/year, the business should grow at a 5% rate, and the going interest rate is 8%. Using a growing perpetuity formula, one value of a business would be: 100,000 / (.08 - .03) = $2,000,000.  This is a very high number, and the seller would love to get it.  It's more common to do a multiple of the EBIDTA. You can do some research into the valuation of the particular industry to figure out the EBIDTA multiplier for the industry. For example, this article suggests that the 2011 EBITDA multiplier for hospitality industries is 13.8. (It's valuing large hotel chains, but it's a start). So the value of this B&B would be around $1,380,000. Here is an online SME valuation tool to help with the EBIDTA multiple based valuation. Also, from my research, it looks like many small business use Seller Discretionary Earnings  (SDE) instead of EBITDA. I don't know much about it, but it seems to serve a similar purpose as EBITDA.  A potential buyer should request the financial statements of the business for the last few years to determine the value of the business, and then can negotiate with the owner a price. You would probably want to enlist a broker to help you with the transaction."

        "question": "How to account for money earned and spent prior to establishing business bank accounts?",
        "answer": "To account for money earned and spent prior to establishing business bank accounts, you should classify the transactions according to their origination. Here is a guideline on how to handle these pre-account transactions:\n\n- **Income Received**: If income was received by the business before the account was established and you, personally, took possession of the money, it could be considered a 'distribution' or a 'loan' to you, depending on how you choose to record it.\n- **Expenses Paid**: Conversely, if you paid for a business expense personally before having a business account, this could be classified as a 'contribution of capital' to the business or a 'loan' from you to the business.\n\nIf these transactions are recorded as loans, you can offset a loan to the business against a loan from the business, thus avoiding the need for two separate loan accounts.\n\nWhen it comes time to record these transactions officially (for instance in an accounting program like QuickBooks), since they were not made through a dedicated business bank account, they cannot be recorded as checks and deposits. Instead, journal entries should be used:\n\n- **For income**: Debit your capital/loan account and credit your income account.\n- **For expenses**: Debit the appropriate expense account and credit your capital/loan account.\n\nWhen setting up a loan account, it should be categorized as either a Current Asset or Current Liability type. Any capital contributions and distributions should be classified under Equity type accounts.\n\nPlease note this is a generalized guideline, and how you classify these transactions might depend on numerous factors, including the specific details of your financial situation, business structure, and tax laws. It is always advisable to consult with a tax professional or accountant to ensure that you are complying with all relevant regulations and accounting standards.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Funds earned and spent before opening a dedicated business account should be classified according to their origination. For example, if your business received income, where did that money go?  If you took the money personally, it would be considered either a 'distribution' or a 'loan' to you.  It is up to you which of the two options you choose. On the flip side, if your business had an expense that you paid personally, that would be considered either a 'contribution of capital' or a 'loan' from you. If you choose to record these transactions as loans, you can offset them together, so you don't need two separate accounts, loan to you and loan from you. When the bank account was opened, the initial deposit came from where?  If it came from your personal funds, then it is either a 'contribution of capital' or a 'loan' from you. From the sound of your question, you deposited what remained after the preceding income/expenses.  This would, in effect, return the 'loan' account back to zero, if choosing that route. The above would also be how to record any expenses you may pay personally for the business (if any) in the future. Because these transactions were not through a dedicated business bank account, you can't record them in Quickbooks as checks and deposits.  Instead, you can use Journal Entries.  For any income received, you would debit your capital/loan account and credit your income account.  For any expenses, you would debit the appropriate expense account and credit your distribution/loan account. Also, if setting up a loan account, you should choose either Current Asset or Current Liability type.  The capital contribution and distribution account should be Equity type. Hope this helps!"

There are requirements for the plan to offer a diversity of investment types, which typically includes money-market funds among others. Although money-market funds are essentially short-term bond investments, they are considered a low-risk option and act as the investment equivalent of cash. These funds are very liquid and carry minimal risk, so they can be treated similarly to cash equivalents, though they are not the same as holding actual cash.\n\nAdditionally, short-term bond funds are commonly offered within 401(k) plans and tend to provide low but positive returns, except in unusual circumstances characterized by dramatically rising interest rates. Pure cash investments are generally not available within 401(k) plans as they typically involve some form of very short-term bonds. In some cases, where permitted by the plan, participants may transfer part of their 401(k) balance to a brokerage account where they might have access to a wider range of investment options, including money market funds.\n\nFinally, it's important to understand that there is no zero-risk investment option\u2014not even cash.

SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) filings provide a wealth of information about a company's financial health, business model, risks, and management's perspective. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Detailed Financial Information:** SEC filings contain comprehensive financial statements that can help investors understand a company's revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows.\n\n2. **Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A):** This section provides management's perspective on the business results and what is driving them.\n\n3. **Risk Factors:** Part of the filings describes the risks the company faces, which can influence an investor's assessment of the company's future prospects.\n\n4. **Insider Transactions:** Filings can reveal information about stock buying or selling by company insiders, which may signal their confidence in the company's future.\n\n5. **Fundamental Analysis:** If a retail trader is focused on fundamental analysis, then SEC filings are an important tool for assessing the intrinsic value of a company.\n\n6. **Regulatory Updates:** Sometimes, SEC filings provide insights into any regulatory issues a company may be facing.\n\n7. **Investment Strategy:** If a retail trader's strategy depends on technical analysis or short-term trading based on market trends and not on the underlying financials of companies, the benefit of reading SEC filings may be less.\n\n8. **Effort and Expertise:** Reading and understanding SEC filings require a significant amount of effort and some financial literacy. Traders should consider whether they have the skills and time to analyze these documents effectively.\n\n9. **Alternative Information Sources:** Retail traders also need to consider whether information obtained from SEC filings can be acquired through other easier-to-digest sources, like analyst reports, news, and summaries provided by financial information services.\n\n10. **Long-term vs Short-term Investing:** Long-term investors may find more value in the information contained in SEC filings than traders who focus on short-term trading strategies.\n\nUltimately, reading SEC filings is a personal choice that depends on the individual's approach to investing. For those who wish to have a deeper understanding of the companies they invest in, SEC filings are an invaluable resource. For others, relying on summarized information from reputable analysts and financial news outlets may be sufficient.",

            "\"There are many different kinds of SEC filings with different purposes.  Broadly speaking, what they have in common is that they are the ways that companies publicly disclose information that they are legally required to disclose.  The page that you listed gives brief descriptions of many types, but if you click through to the articles on individual types of filings, you can get more info. One of the most commonly discussed filings is the 10-K, which is, as Wikipedia says, \"\"a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance\"\".  This includes info like earnings and executive pay. One example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is Form 4, which is a disclosure of \"\"insider trading\"\".  People with a privileged stake in a company (executives, directors, and major shareholders) cannot legally buy or sell shares without disclosing it by filing a Form 4.  Some people think that you can make use of this information in the sense that if, for instance, the CEO of Google buys a bunch of Twitter stock, they may have some reason for thinking it will go up, so maybe you should buy it too.  Whether such inferences are accurate, and whether you can garner a practical benefit from them (i.e., whether you can manage to buy before everyone else notices and drives the price up) is debatable. My personal opinion would be that, for an average retail investor, readng SEC filings is unlikely to be useful.  The reason is that an average retail investor shouldn't be investing in individual companies at all, but rather in mutual funds or ETFs, which typically provide comparable returns with far less risk.  SEC filings are made by individual companies, so it doesn't generally help you to read them unless you're going to take action related to an individual company.  It doesn't generally make sense to take action related to an individual company if you don't have the time and energy to read a large number of SEC filings to decide which company to take action on.  If you have the time and energy to read a large number of SEC filings, you're probably not an average retail investor.  If you are a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues, you might benefit from reading SEC filings.  However, if you aren't already reading SEC filings, you're probably not a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues. That said, if you're a currently-average investor with big dreams, it could be instructive to read a few filings to explore what you might do with them.  You could, for instance, allocate a \"\"play money\"\" fund of a few thousand dollars and try your hand at following insider trades or the like.  If you make some money, great; if not, oh well.  Realistically, though, there are so many people who make a living reading SEC filings and acting on them every day that you have little chance of finding a \"\"diamond in the rough\"\" unless you also make a living by doing it every day. It's sort of like asking \"\"Should I read Boating Monthly to improve my sailing skills?\"\"  If you're asking because you want to rent a Hobie Cat and go for a pleasure cruise now and then, sure, it can't hurt.  If you're asking because you want to enter the America's Cup, you can still read Boating Monthly, but it won't in itself meaningfully increase your chances of winning the America's Cup.\"",
            "I use 10-K and 10-Qs to understand to read the disclosed risk factors related to a business. Sometimes they are very comical. But when you see that risk factor materializing you can understand how it will effect the company. For example, one microlending company's risk factor stated that if Elizabeth Warren becomes head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau we will have a hard time... so we are expanding in Mexico and taking our politically unfavorable lending practices there. I like seeing how many authorized shares there are or if there are plans to issue more. An example was where I heard from former employees of a company how gullible the other employees at that company were and how they all thought they were going to get rich or were being told so by upper management. Poor/Quirky/Questionable/Misleading management is one of my favorite things to look for in a company so I started digging into their SEC filings and saw that they were going to do a reverse split which would make the share prices trade higher (while experiencing no change in market cap), but then digging further I saw that they were only changing the already issued shares, but keeping the authorized shares at the much larger amount of shares, and that they planned to do financing by issuing more of the authorized shares. I exclaimed that this would mean the share prices would drop by 90%-99% after the reverse split and you mean to tell me that nobody realizes this (employees or the broad market). I was almost tempted to stand outside their office and ask employees if I could borrow their shares to short, because there wasn't enough liquidity on the stock market! This was almost the perfect short but it wasn't liquid or have any options so not perfect after all. It traded from $20 after the reverse split to $1.27 I like understanding how much debt a company is in and the structure of that debt, like if a loan shark has large payments coming up soon. This is generally what I use those particular forms for. But they contain a lot of information A lot of companies are able to act they way they do because people do not read."

        "question": "Is it wise to have plenty of current accounts in different banks?",
        "answer": "Whether it's wise to have multiple current accounts across various banks depends on your specific financial situation, needs, and goals. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Financial Organization:** Multiple accounts can help separate finances for different purposes, such as business and personal expenses, or budgeting for various goals.\n\n2. **Bank Services and Features:** Different banks may offer unique services, account features, or technologies that suit certain needs better than others.\n\n3. **Access to Funds:** Having accounts in different banks can provide more options for accessing funds, particularly if one bank has technical issues or restrictions.\n\n4. **Promotions and Incentives:** Opening accounts in different banks might allow you to take advantage of promotional offers or higher interest rates.\n\n5. **Financial Security:** Diversifying your accounts can add a layer of security, as it reduces the impact of fraud or failure in any single bank. Each bank will have its own coverage limit for insurance purposes (e.g., FDIC in the USA).\n\n6. **Fees and Charges:** More accounts can mean more fees. It's essential to understand the fee structure of each bank to avoid unnecessary costs.\n\n7. **Complexity and Time Management:** Managing multiple accounts requires more effort and organization. The complexity of keeping track of various accounts and transactions may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n8. **Credit Rating:** Having multiple current accounts doesn't necessarily harm your credit rating, but each application for a new account might involve a credit check, which can affect your score.\n\n9. **Relationship with Bank:** Sometimes, developing a strong relationship with one bank through multiple services can have advantages like better customer service or favorable terms on loans and other products.\n\nIt is also advisable to read guidance provided by financial experts or regulated financial institutions, and I can look for such guidance in the file you've uploaded if it contains any financial information.

You should be careful about carrying too many credit cards and incurring too much debt as you could find yourself in a situation whereby you may not be able to pay off your monthly interest, much less the principal balance. Credit cards are not insurance. With many years of experience under my belt I can tell you that the best approach is to live within (or below) your means and avoid carrying a balance on credit cards. I carry only one credit card (really a charge card) and I pay off the balance every month. Treat a credit card as a 30 day interest free loan and pay your balance off in full every month...as you progress through life you will save yourself a lot of heartache (and money) if you take this approach.",

Hence they explicitly restrict the best deals on credit cards, savings accounts, etc, to new customers only.

But to say that you might keep some credit available so that if you have a legitimate emergency -- like, say, your car breaks down and you don't have the cash to fix it and you can't get to work without it -- you have some a fallback. But do you really need ten credit cards for that sort of thing? And how much credit are they giving you on each card? I don't know how the banks work this, but I'd think if they're rational, they'd consider your total credit before giving you more.  I have three credit cards that I use regularly -- two personal and one business. And I find that a real pain to keep track of, to make sure that I keep each one paid by the due date and to keep a handle on how much I owe and so forth. I can't imagine trying to deal with ten.

        "answer": "If you need to withdraw money early from a Time Certificate of Deposit (CD), there are certain penalties you may encounter. By federal law, any CD cashed out early is subject to a minimum penalty. If the withdrawal occurs within the first six days after deposit, you will face a penalty of at least seven days' simple interest. Beyond that, banks can set their own penalties, and there is no legal maximum for these penalties. The specific penalties can vary significantly from one bank to another, and they might be based on a certain number of months' interest, a percentage of the CD, or a more complex formula.\n\nYou should check the Account Agreement provided by the bank when you opened the CD; it should explain the early withdrawal penalties and mention if there's a grace period soon after opening the account during which the penalty is reduced. Despite these potential penalties, your principal investment should be safe, and you will only lose a portion of the accumulated interest by closing the CD early.",

Additionally, you may want to review the Account Agreement that the bank provided when you opened the account, as it explains the early withdrawal penalties. Check the paperwork to see if there is a short period at the start where the penalty is minimal. Each bank can set their own rules for the maximum penalty.

As suggested in the document, for anything other than minor expenses, you should only decide to decline while with the salesperson. If you are considering the purchase, it is wise to step away from the situation to think about it on your own, perhaps in a quiet place like a coffee shop. For substantial purchases, it might be even better to sleep on it and decide the following day. When you have made your decision, inform the salesperson without offering explanations if you decide not to proceed, as this prevents them from using your reasons to overcome any objections you may have.",

            "\"In my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now, 100% of the time it is not true. Of course I can't guarantee that is universally the case, but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later, or tomorrow, or next week, it's extremely likely that they'll still take your money for the original price. (In fact, sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the \"\"excellent offer\"\"...) Most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a \"\"this price is only good right now\"\" pitch, it ends up being because they don't want you to go search the competition and read reviews. In this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile. Perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price. Sales is an art, and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it. This particular salesperson obviously misjudged you and/or you don't have an easily exploitable vulnerability. I wouldn't let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase. If you are worried about the scenario of someone else snatching up the item, consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you \"\"reflect\"\" and/or \"\"arrange for the funds\"\".\"",
            "There are few main reasons I can think of that the salesperson would do this: A lot of people assume it's the 3rd option always.  But if the person is reputable, it's most likely 1 or 2. You can't run a business doing option 3 for long without getting a reputation.",
            "\"This is way too long for a comment, so I am posting this as an answer. My bet is that you're buying a new piano. It is the only instrument that makes sense. The rest of this answer are going to assume this, but this should apply well if you're going after a violin or marimba for example. For those readers that do not know, a piano is a very delicate and expensive music instrument. My piano is literally more expensive than my car. There are a lot of similarities in sales negotiation between buying a piano and buying a car. You may be surprised to know that the cost for the dealer to acquire a piano is only around half the listed price. Therefore, the salesperson has a lot of room to negotiate a sale price to you. This explains why he was able to make a good offer for the model you are not intending to buy. You are best by comparing the final sale price with other similar models in your region, or the exact model around your region, which you have already did. Those indicate the standard price in your negotiation. You described the dealer had the exact model you desire, only in different appearance. I assume you want a black color while they have a white or wood-pattern one in their showroom. Note, every piano is different. Even with the exact same model, there will be very slight differences in the tune and touch, since some processes are hand finished. (If you're buying a Steinway, treat each of them as an individual hand crafted art.) Play the exact instrument you will be buying before closing the deal. If they do not have your desired model in the showroom, ask for a visit to their inventory facility. Again, play the exact instrument, not a showroom model. Some dishonest dealers will have their showroom pianos regulated and tuned differently than the \"\"standard\"\" pianos from shipping. If you get an extremely good offer, proceed with caution. There may be defects in that particular instrument. Look for rust or oxidized layers on the strings. Look for groves in the hammers. Listen to clicking noises when playing the keys. These are signs that the instrument has been around for quite a while and they cannot sell it. You can also copy down the serial number and look up the manufacturing date online. Before you close the deal, ask for after-sale services. How many free tunings will they provide? Will they polish your piano after delivery? These are bargain chips you can use for final adjustment of the price.\"",
            "I often spend weeks or months (and sometimes even years) deciding whether to buy something. Certainly the dealer should recognize you by now if you take a third opportunity to look at the same instrument. You could politely remind him that you've twice declined his excellent prices. From there you can assert that you will purchase only when you are ready.",
            "\"My advice is to quit worrying about the salesman's tactics.  They are a distraction.  What do you want?  How much are you willing to pay for it.  If you want the instrument, decide how much you want to pay for it.  Round down to the next even hundred.  Take that much in $100 bills.  Put the money in his hand and say, \"\"This is what I have, take it or leave it\"\".  You must be prepared to walk out of the store without the instrument.\"",
            "\"I have a very simple rule. For anything other than trivial purchases (a small fraction of my monthly income), the only final decision I will make in the presence of a salesperson is \"\"No\"\". After I have the terms nailed down, and still feel that I am likely to buy the item, I leave the store, car dealership etc., and think about it by myself. Often, I go to a mall coffee shop to do the thinking. If it is really big, I sleep on it and make my decision the next day. Once I have made my decision, I inform the salesperson. If the decision is \"\"No\"\" I do not discuss my reasons - that gives them an overcome-the-objection lever. I just tell them I have decided not to buy the item, which is all they need to know.\"",
            "From your question and how you have framed it, I get you find Agressive Sales tactics disturb the buying process for you. ;) I understand because I also find the whole process of Research / Negotiating / Buying / Owning / Using is all on one continuum, so anything that ruins the process will likely lose the sale or enjoyment of the item, at the end of the day.  [Very long answer .... Sorry :) ] The answer to this is to KNOW what you want before you have to deal with the Sales people. A good Sales person likes a customer who knows what they want. I would suggest that you follow my 'Buying Process' (Much you have already done) : Before you Buy: Identify the item you want and the max/min 'realistic' price you  would buy at. [Stick to this price else 'Buyers Remorse' may bite  later.] Write the questions you have down on paper before you visit the    Dealer. Write the answers you want on the same list, if known. Decide which questions are most important and therefore must get the  answer you want. These should be the questions you ask first. Mark  these on the list. Re-visit points 1-3 are they complete and to your satisfaction ? Would you buy if all the answers & the price are right ? If NO then re-visit point 1-3 else you are not ready to buy now !!! If YES then Organise your visit to the Dealer. [Book appointment etc if needed.] At Dealer: Meet your Sales person and clearly state what you want (the item) and importantly when you intend to buy, if all your questions are answered to your satisfaction.  There is no need to discuss price at this point as the 'haggling' is only possible IF the questions are answered to your satisfaction. Do not give information such as your maximum budget or similar requests, as they give the sales person the upper hand to maximise his/her pricing.  If asked state that your budget is conditional on the answers you get. As the questions are answered assess the answer and assign +/- to the question on your list. If any of your most critical / important questions are answered in the negative, they are the reasons you have to call it a day and walk out. You can assess whether they are worth ignoring but you will need to factor this into your price and if you have identified your questions correctly there should be little room for debate. Assuming you have got all your questions answered you should know what you are buying and have assessed what is a reasonable price for it, if you still want it as this point.  If you have lost interest, say so and let the Sales person go. Don't waste their time. They may make some sort of offer to you BUT don't forget that if you have doubts now they will not go away easily no matter what the 'great' price is. If you want it then continue. Buying your Item: [None of the following is really usefull if you have told the Sales person your Budget, as they will be aiming for the highest end of your budget. You will often find that the best price is very close to your maximum budget !!! :)] Do not forget your realistic price range, this should limit your buying price no matter what tactics are used by the Sales person. Only you know what you are prepared to pay and if an extra 1% or 50% is considered worth it to you, if you have to have the item :) Regardless, you have to have some idea of your limit and be prepared to stick to it. You must be able to walk away if the price is silly and not worth it. Assuming you have not been smitten by your item and funds are NOT unlimited, ask for the price and assess it against your price range. At this point I can only offer pointers as there are no 'magic' rules to get what you want at the lowest price. The only advice I would offer is that you will be lucky to get something at your 1st offer price unless the seller really needs to sell, because of this your 1st offer should be less than your price range lowest band. You will need to assess how much less but be prepared to get a 'No' response. If you get a 'Yes' and your research is good 'Buy It !!!' If you get too enthusiastic a response, question your research & if not sure bail out [No Sale] :) At this point you are likely to be 'Haggling' so you need to be ready for all the 'Must buy Now' tactics. If you have clearly stated your wants and timescales there is no reason to be pulled in by these tactics and they can be ignored until the price has reached the level you are happy with. If the price is not moving where you want than clearly state you cannot 'buy at that price'. If you get a total stop and no movement than you need to assess your 'need' and if priced too high then you should walk out. Remember if you stated that you had a timescale to buy of 1/2/3 weeks you should act like you have 1/2/3 weeks to keep looking. Any eagerness on your part will tell the Sales person that you have lied !!! :) You can always come back and try again, reminding the Sales person that the 'item' is still there and perhaps it is priced too high to sell and make the same offer. !!! (A bit of cheek sometimes works.) If the price is close and you still want it and the Sales person is not moving you need to try walking out while stating that you would love the 'item' if it was priced better, if no improved offer as you go, try an increased offer but again you need to assess how much and remember you can only go up, or walk out and come back another day. If the price is at a level you are happy with then you should have no reason not to buy (if you have followed this process) but this does not mean that you should be forced into buying now if you do not want to. Regardless of any 'Must buy now' tactics if the price is right and you cannot buy now, tell the Sales person when you CAN buy and see if you can get an agreement with this. It is unfair to expect a price to be held for an indeterminate time, so you do need to state when you could buy if not now when a price has been agreed. This is a point where the deal may break down if the Sales person thinks they have a sale and trys to force the Sale now. Once again you have to assess your 'need' and whether buying now is better than walking out. If the deal breaks down there is nothing stopping you from coming back and offering the same price when you can buy. A final option is to agree if a deposit can be left to reserve the item until you can buy. This gives the Sales person some assurance that you will come back and is sometimes NON-Refundable unless you agree otherwise before you pay, so check this detail first. (This tends to be smaller Dealers but generally in the UK the large companies offer refundable deposits as part of their Customer Service, the advantage of using larger Stores/Dealers etc.) Apologies for the epic reply, hope it helps.",
            "\"He sounds like a very bad salesman and I should know, because I was a sales manager at a bike shop which sold bikes from $200 to $10k. Now I had a clear goal, which is to sell as many bikes at the highest price possible, but I didn't do that by making customers uncomfortable. Each customer received different treatment depending on what they were looking for.  For example, the $200 beach cruiser buyer was going to be told \"\"You look great on that bike... can I ring you up?\"\", whereas the racer interested in saving grams will receive a detailed discussion about his bike options.  The $200 bike customer won't have very sophisticated questions (although I could give a lecture on cruisers), so giving out too much info complicates a likely quick impulse buy.  On the other hand, we are building a relationship with the racer which will include detailed fitting sessions and time-consuming mechanical service.  While I also want to close a high priced sale, it will take several visits to prove both I have the right bike and this is the best shop. But no matter what you were buying, I was always pleasant and unhurried, and my customers left happy.   Specifically with this situation of high pressure tactics, the problem is the competition with internet sales.  Often customers will have only 2 criteria, the model and the price, and if a shop does not meet both, the customer walks right out.   Possibly this sales guy is a bit cynical with his tactics, but the reality is that if you have no relationship with that shop, you fall into the category of internet buyer.  One thing the sales guy could have done was not tell you we wasn't going to honor this price if you came back.  Occasionally there would be an internet buyer, and I showed no unpleasantness even though internet sellers could crush our brick and mortar shop.  I would mention a competitive price and if he bought it, great, and if not, that's just business.   As for the buyer, I would treat these tactics with a certain detachment.  I would personally chuckle at his treatment and ask if I could kick the tires, an user car saying.   I suppose the bottom line is if you are ready to buy this specific model, and if the price is right (and the shop is ethical so you won't get ripped off with garbage), then you have to be ready to buy on the spot. I will point out one horrible experience I had at a car dealership.  I came in 15 minutes before closing and a sales person gave me a price almost a third cheaper than list.  I wasn't ready to buy on my first visit ever to a dealership and of course, buying a car has all kinds of hidden fees.  I asked will this be the price tomorrow, and he said absolutely not.  I told him, \"\"so if I come in tomorrow morning, your dealer clock has only gone 15 minutes\"\" but that logic did not register with him.   Maybe he thought I was going to spend 15k on the spot and pressure tactics would work on me.  I never came back, but I did go another dealership and bought a car after a reasonable negotiation.\"",
            "As described by the other answers, there are pretty harmless explanations for that behaviour. You could be slightly worried because he gave you exceptionally good deals for both instruments, but that's neither here nor there. Maybe he simply prices all items way up to be able to give a great discount on either sale. You can't ever know; the actual price you pay in the end is what counts. What I would do: If I expect in advance (or if I notice during the negotiation) that I am put under pressure in this way, I usually try to do exactly the same, in reverse. That is, I take  a minute to explain up front that I will not, under any circumstance, buy right now, but that this is a purely informational event. I will make sure not to have my money/card with me. Any high-end salesman worth his sale should have no problem with that at all. Money aside, you are shopping for something that will mean a lot to you. The salesman is not some peddler of arbitrary wares. Everybody understands that not only do you not want to pay too high a price, but also that you want to really get the item you want, and want to be happy with it for a long time. This is a tough decision, often, and if the salesman cannot, or does not want to respect that, then it would be a clear signal for me that dubious things are going on. In fact, you would probably be unhappier if you got the wrong item for a great price than if you got a great item for a slightly too-high price. That is something you should probably not tell the salesman ;), but can keep in mind. So getting the greatest deal of all times is probably not so high on your priority list.",

You might have to say \u201cNo\u2026\u201d when doing this but it\u2019s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression.

What would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need? This is the basic concept surrounding all economics.

That said\u2014and in the case of musical instruments\u2014maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques. Keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods. For things like musical instruments, people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great. Will you need to go to them if/when your instrument needs repair? Or you don\u2019t care? At the end of the day, go with your gut.

        "question": "Credit and Debit",
        "answer": "In accounting, credit and debit are the two fundamental aspects that are used to record transactions. They are based on the accounting equation which states that Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Here's a simple explanation:\n\n- **Debit**: An entry that increases an asset or expense account, or decreases a liability, equity, or revenue account. It is the amount you are putting into a particular category.\n- **Credit**: An entry that decreases an asset or expense account, or increases a liability, equity, or revenue account. It is the amount coming out of a particular category.\n\nFor example, if a business owner invests $10,000 into their business, the accounting entry would be:\n- Debit: Assets (Cash account) for $10,000 (because the business has received money, increasing its assets)\n- Credit: Owner's Equity (Contributions account) for $10,000 (because the money is coming from the owner's contributions, increasing the owner's equity)\n\nSimilarly, if there is a sale made:\n- Debit: Assets (Cash account) for $10,000 (cash or value is coming into the business through a sale)\n- Credit: Owner's Equity (Sales account) for $10,000 (reflecting the income from the sale)\n\nAnd if the sum is a deposit in a bank by the business:\n- Debit: Assets (Cash account) for $10,000 (increasing the assets of the business)\n- Credit: Liabilities (Deposits account) for $10,000 (the bank has an obligation to return this amount on demand to the business, reflecting a liability). \n\nKeep in mind that a bank's term \"deposits\" refers to its obligation to return the amount on demand to the depositor, although the bank can utilize those funds (as in fractional banking). \n\nShould you need more detailed explanations or examples, please do not hesitate to ask.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "It took me a while to understand the concept, so I'll break it down as best as I can.  There are three parts to the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity We'll look at this in two ways   1. As a business owner you invest (say) 10,000 USD into your bank. The entry would be: Debit: Assets: Cash for 10,000    Credit: Owner's Equity: Contributions for 10,000 In this case, you have assets of 10,000 from your deposit, but it is due to owner contributions and not business transactions. Another example (say a sale):  Debit: Assets: Cash for 10,000    Credit: Owner's Equity: Sales for 10,000 Debit: Assets: Cash for 10,000    Credit: Liabilities: Deposits for 10,000 Deposits are a banking term to reflect a bank's obligation to return the amount on demand (though the bank has free reign with it, see fractional banking)  You will NEVER debit or credit your bank as it is assumed you will be storing your money there, note bank reconciliation. Hope this helps, comment with any more questions.",
            "In view of business, we have to book the entries. Business view, owner and business are different. When capital is invested in business by owner, in future business has to repay it.  That's why, capital always credit. When we come about  bank (business prospective) - cash, bank, fd are like assets which can help in the business. Bank is current asset (Real account) - Debit (what comes into the business)                                        Credit (what goes out of the business) Hence credit and debit differs from what type of account is it.... credit - when business liables debit - what business has and receivables"

        "answer": "Beyond RRSP deductions, high-income earners can save on taxes by saving a portion of their income and investing in the stock market. Specifically, saving 15% of their income and investing in an S&P 500 index mutual fund is mentioned as a reasonable approach. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the S&P 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11%, including at least two significant market crashes. If one were to start at age 25 with nothing invested and begin investing $100 per week, assuming an average return rate of 9%, they could become a millionaire by the age of 60. It's also stated that sticking with the 15% investment rate throughout one's career is likely to yield even better results, especially since one's income typically increases over time, and many people work past age 60, further allowing their investments to grow. \n\nOf course, this advice presumes consistent saving and investment patterns, and actual outcomes will depend on many factors, including market performance and individual circumstances.

However, based on the information I was able to see before the error, your account entries for dealing with prepaid rent in accrual-based accounting are mostly accurate.

The expense should be recognized in the statements once the prepaid rent is consumed, which is when it accrues and the second entry should be booked. \n\nIn other words, when you initially pay for the rent, it should be recorded as a prepaid expense (asset) on the balance sheet. As time passes and the prepaid period elapses, the prepaid expense should be decreased, and the corresponding rent expense should be recognized in the income statement.\n\nPlease be sure to check your accounting software\u2019s documentation or consult with an accountant to ensure that the expenses are correctly recorded in line with the accrual-based accounting principles.

So in that description, what they are saying is that the original business received products from plantations and sent products to manufacturing. This is also called vertical integration.  Meaning that they are diversifying along their supply chain so that they control more of it.  This is in contrast with horizontal integration, where they move into new products that either compete with the existing products or which are entirely separate.   In general, the upside of vertical integration is that a company is less reliant on suppliers (and intermediate consumers) and has more control over its supply chain.  The downside is that they have less opportunity to partner with other companies in the same supply chain, as they compete with them.  Some companies are better at managing to do both.  For example, Amazon.com has integrated fulfillment and sales.  But partners can still do their own fulfillment and/or sales, choosing how much to send out to Amazon.   If you are investing in individual stocks, integrated companies can be problematic in that they cut across diversification areas.  So they can be harder to balance with other stocks.  You can either buy plantations, transport, and manufacturing together or not buy at all.  If your investment strategy says to increase plantations and reduce manufacturing, this can be difficult to implement with an integrated company.

Demonstrating a history of saving the amount needed for the down payment can show financial responsibility despite poor credit.\n\n2. **Local Bank and REO Property**: It's advantageous to work with a local bank that holds onto the mortgages they write instead of selling them.

The borrower is responsible for paying back the full amount of the loan; if the foreclosure sale results in a shortfall, this is still the borrower's responsibility. However, filing for bankruptcy can wipe out the shortfall and most other debts, but it would typically involve liquidation of the borrower's assets to contribute towards the debt repayment.

Usually the sale is done through a sheriff's sale, that is, a more or less carefully supervised auction. Bankruptcy will wipe out the shortfall, and most other debts, but the downside is that most of the rest of your assets will also be sold to help pay off what you owe.

They will certainly not sell it for $1. The main reason for this is that the bank would prefer to own $100k, than a loan to them from a customer for $100k. Banks have to discount the value of loans to take into account the likelihood of the loan not being repaid. They classify certain loans as riskier than others, and these are discounted more heavily. An unsecured home loan to a customer that has already defaulted, has no collateral, and now needs to pay rent AND loan repayments would count as an extremely risky loan."

        "answer": "Yes, saving 15% of your income starting at age 25 and investing it in the stock market can likely make you a millionaire. The historical Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the S&P 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11%, including at least two significant market crashes. If you were to average a 9% return, starting with nothing invested, and began investing $100 per week (which is about 15% of an annual income of $35,000) in an S&P 500 index mutual fund, you would have roughly $1.2 million by the time you are 60 years old. It's important to note that actual returns may be more or less than this estimate, depending on stock market performance.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Yes, quite easily, in fact.  You left a lot of numbers out, so lets start with some assumptions. If you are at the median of middle income families in the US that might mean $70,000/year. 15% of that is an investment of $875 per month. If you invest that amount monthly and assume a 6% return, then you will have a million dollars at approximately 57 years old. 6% is a very conservative number, and as Ben Miller points out, the S&P 500 has historically returned closer to 11%. If you assumed an aggressive 9% return, and continued with that $875/month for 40 years until you turn 65, that becomes $4 million. Start with a much more conservative $9/hr for $18,720 per year (40 hours * 52 weeks, no overtime). If that person saved 14% of his/her income or about $219 per month from 25 to 65 years old with the same 9%, they would still achieve $1 million for retirement. Is it much harder for a poor person? Certainly, but hopefully these numbers illustrate that it is better to save and invest even a small amount if that's all that can be done. High income earners have the most to gain if they save and the most to lose if they don't. Let's just assume an even $100,000/year salary and modest 401(k) match of 3%. Even married filing jointly a good portion of that salary is going to be taxed at the 25% rate. If single you'll be hitting the 28% income tax rate.  If you can max out the $18,000 (2017) contribution limit and get an additional $3,000 from an employer match (for a total monthly contribution of $1750) 40 years of contributions would become $8.2 million with the 9% rate of return.  If you withdrew that money at 4% per year you would have a residual income of $300k throughout your retirement.",

You can model it with a very simple spreadsheet:  Formula view:  You can change this simple model with any other assumptions you wish to make and model. This spreadsheet presumes that you only make $50,000/year, never get a raise, that your savings earns 6% per year and that the market never has a crash like 2008. The article never states the assumptions that the author has made, and therefore we can't honestly determine how truthful the author is.

            "Yes, becoming a millionaire is a reasonable goal.  Saving 15% of your income starting at age 25 and investing in the stock market will likely get you there. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of the S&P 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11%. (That 35 years includes at least two fairly serious crashes.) You may get more or less than that number in the future, but let's guess that you'll average 9%. Let's say that you begin with nothing invested, and you start investing $100 per week at age 25. (If your annual income is $35,000, that is about 15% of your income.)  You decide to invest your money in an S&P 500 index mutual fund. 35 years from now when you are 60 years old, you would be a millionaire ($1.2 Million, actually). You may earn less than the assumed 9%, depending on how the stock market does.  However, if you stick with your 15% investment amount throughout your whole career, you'll most likely end up with more, because your income will probably increase during your career.  And you will probably be working past age 60, giving your investments time to earn even more.",
            "I'll offer another answer, using different figures. Let's assume 6% is the rate of return you can expect.  You are age 25, and plan to retire at age 65.  If you have $0 and want $1M at retirement, you will need to put away $524.20/month, or $6,290.40/year, which is 15% of $41,936.  So $41,936 is what you'd need to make per year in order to get to your target. You can calculate your own figures with a financial calculator:  480 months as your term (or, adjust this to your time horizon in months), .486755% as your interest (or, take your assumed interest rate + 1 to the 1/12th power and subtract 1 to convert to a monthly interest rate), 0 as your PV, and $1M as your FV; then solve for PMT.",

Therefore, lets start with 1 dollar for 40 years: With your current income, 15% would be 82.5 dollar. At 12% this would over 40 years get you almost 1 million dollar. I would call a required return of more than 12% not 'likely'. The good news, is that your income will likely increase, and especially if this happens fast things will start to look up.  The bad news is, that your current salary is quite low. So, it basically means that you need to make some big jumps in the next few years in order to make this scenario likely. If you can quickly move your salary towards ranges that are more common in the US, then 15% of your income can build up to a million before you retire. However, if you just follow gradual growth, you would need to get quite lucky to reach a million.  Note that even if reaching a million appears unlikely, it is probably still a good idea to save!",

            "As others have shown, if you assume that you can get 6% and you invest 15% of a reasonable US salary then you can hit 1 million by the time you retire. If you invest in property in a market like the UK (where I come from...) then insane house price inflation will do it for you as well. In 1968 my parents bought a house for \u00a38000. They had a mortgage on it for about 75% of the value. They don't live there but that house is now valued at about \u00a3750,000. Okay, that's close to 60 years, but with a 55 year working life that's not so unreasonable. If you assume the property market (or the shares market) can go on rising forever... then invest in as much property as you can with your 15% as mortgage payments... and watch the million roll in. Of course, you've also got rent on your property portfolio as well in the intervening years. However, take the long view. Inflation will hit what a million is worth. In 1968, a million was a ridiculously huge amount of money. Now it's 'Pah, so what, real rich people have billions'. You'll get your million and it will not be enough to retire comfortably on! In 1968 my parents salaries as skilled people were about \u00a32000 a year... equivalent jobs now pay closer to \u00a350,000... 25x salary inflation in the time. Do that again, skilled professional salary in 60 years of \u00a3125000 a year... so your million is actually 4 years salary.

            "\"Other people have already demonstrated the effect of compound interest to the question. I'd like to add a totally different perspective.  Note that the article says if you can follow this simple recipe throughout your working career, you will almost certainly beat out most professional investors [...] you'll likely accumulate enough savings to retire comfortably. (the latter point may be the more practical mark than the somewhat arbitrary million (rupees? dollars?) My point here is that the group of people who do put away a substantial fraction of their (lower) early wages and keep them invested for decades show (at least) two traits that will make a very substantial difference to the average (western) person. They may be correlated, though: people who are not tempted or able to resist the temptation to spend (almost) their whole income may be more likely to not touch their savings or investments. (In my country, people like to see themselves as \"\"world champions in savings\"\", but if you talk to people you find that many people talk about saving for the next holidays [as opposed to saving for retirement].) Also, if you get going this way long before you are able to retire you reach a relative level of independence that can give you a much better position in wage negotiations as you do not need to take the first badly paid job that comes along in order to survive but can afford to wait and look and negotiate for a better job.  Psychologically, it also seems to be easier to consistently keep the increase in your spending below the increase of your income than to reduce spending once you overspent. There are studies around that find homeowners on average substantially more wealthy than people who keep living in rental appartments (I'm mostly talking Germany, were renting is normal and does not imply poverty - but similar findings have also been described for the US) even though someone who'd take the additional money the homeowner put into their home over the rent and invested in other ways would have yielded more value than the home. The difference is largely attributed to the fact that buying and downpaying a home enforces low spending and saving, and it is found that after some decades of downpayment homeowners often go on to spend less than their socio-economic peers who rent. The group that is described in this question is one that does not even need the mental help of enforcing the savings. In addition, if this is not about the fixed million but about reaching a level of wealth that allows you to retire: people who have practised moderate spending habits as adults for decades are typically also much better able to get along with less in retirement than others who did went with a high consumption lifestyle instead (e.g. the homeowners again).  My estimate is that these effects compound in a way that is much more important than the \"\"usual\"\" compounding effect of interest - and even more if you look at interest vs. inflation, i.e. the buying power of your investment for everyday life.  Note that they also cause the group in question to be more resilient in case of a market crash than the average person with about no savings (note that market crashes lead to increased risk of job loss).  Slightly off topic: I do not know enough how difficult saving 50 USD out of 50 USD in Pakistan is - and thus cannot comment whether the savings effort called for in the paper is equivalent/higher/lower than what you achieve. I find that trying to keep to student life (i.e. spending that is within the means of a student) for the first professional years can help kick-starting a nest egg (European experience - again, not sure whether applicable in Pakistan).\"",
            "If by being a millionaire you mean dollar millionaire then I doubt that it is really that easy in Pakistani context. At present the exchange rate is 107 Pakistani rupees per US dollar so even with this exchange rate, to have a million US dollars means having 107 million rupees of wealth. Now with this maths in mind you can very well calculate how much possible it is for an average 25 years old Pakistani to have that much wealth. And by the time you have 107 million Pakistani rupees of wealth the exchange rate against the US dollar would have only gone up against Pakistani currency. That article which you have mentioned makes calculations in US context and dollar terms. However if you talk only in terms of your country's context then being a millionaire means having 1 million rupees of wealth and that is something which is quite achievable with your salary and within very short span of time.",
            "The really simple answer is that compound interest is compound not linear.  Money invested for longer earns more interest, and the sooner you start investing, the longer it has to earn interest.  These ideas come out of pension investment where 65 is the usual retirement age and what you invest in the 1st ten years of your pension (or any other compound interest fund) accounts for over 50% of what you will get out. 25 to 65 is forty years and $100 invested at 7% for 40 years is $1400.  $100 invested every year for 40 years the pot would be worth just under $20,000. At 30 years, it would be worth under $10,000, and at 20 years it would be worth only $4099.  If you double your investment amount every 10 years you would have invested $15700, and the pot would be worth $45,457. Do exactly the same but starting at 35 instead of 25 and your pot would only be worth $14,200.",

It's not the average, it's the minimum, the value you can expect and plan with. Just to reinforce the claim, I can cite Irrational Exuberance of Robert Schiller, who explicitly says, on page 135 of the 2015 edition, that from January 1966 to January 1992 the real annual return was just 4.1%. Sure, this does not matter so much if you are investing all the way through, but it's still a 26 year period."

        "question": "Accounting for reimbursements that exceed actual expenses",
        "answer": "When accounting for reimbursements that exceed actual expenses, it's essential to differentiate between the treatment for personal use and business use. For personal use, cash back from credit cards is typically not taxable because most personal purchases are made with after-tax dollars, and any cashback received doesn't affect the tax bill. However, for business use, cashback or similar rewards are taxable since businesses deduct expenses. The cash back should be accounted for but not as income; rather, it should be treated as a negative expense.\n\nFor a small business owner, expenses covered by credit card reward points, such as airfare, hotel, and car rental for a business seminar, are not deductible because they are essentially refunded by the reward points. This means that the expenses will not be deducted for business tax purposes since they did not actually incur a cost that would show up on a bank or credit card statement.\n\nIf employees use personal credit cards for business expenses and receive rewards points or cashback, these rewards are not typically treated as taxable income. There is a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach that the IRS seems to accept in these cases, especially for regular business-related items such as travel expenses. However, one should not abuse this practice with significant expenditures like purchasing numerous high-value items, like laptops, for which the company would normally negotiate prices or purchase directly to receive a discount or other benefits. The key principle is that only expenses actually incurred\u2014and thus appearing on a bank or credit card statement\u2014can be deducted.\n\nThe treatment is the same for credit card points and brand-loyalty points used for business expenses; there's no difference in how they should be accounted for when it comes to deductions.",

        "answer": "The average investor can lose money or underperform the market due to a variety of reasons. Some of these include making poor investment decisions and the natural erosion of returns due to transaction costs, such as borrowing costs or margin trading, which can decrease net returns in comparison to the market. For instance, if the market return is 5% and transaction costs amount to 1%, the average investor may witness a lower net return.

        "question": "What will my taxes be as self employed?",
        "answer": "As a self-employed individual, you are responsible for paying self-employment (SE) tax, which is essentially equivalent to the taxes for Social Security and Medicare that would normally be paid by both an employer and an employee. The SE tax comprises of two parts:\n\n1. **Social Security Tax**: This is charged at a rate of 12.4% up to an income cap that is adjusted annually for inflation (for example, in 2017 the cap was $127,200).\n2. **Medicare Tax**: This is charged at a rate of 2.9% with no income cap, plus an additional Medicare tax if your income exceeds a certain higher threshold.\n\nMoreover, if your Limited Liability Company (LLC) has not elected corporation status (i.e., it is a disregarded entity for tax purposes), you would include the business income and expenses on Schedule C as part of your individual tax return on Form 1040. The net income from self-employment will be subject to SE tax along with your other income (if any) for income tax computations.\n\nIn addition to SE tax, you're also required to make estimated tax payments throughout the year which generally should be at least 90% of your tax bill or 100% of your tax bill from the previous year\u2014which one is less. Failure to make sufficient and timely estimated payments can result in a penalty, although there might be exceptions for your first year of business.\n\nIf you are married and have a spouse who is also self-employed, they will need to file their own Schedule SE, and your estimated tax payments should cover both your income tax and your combined self-employment taxes . \n\nPlease note that state taxes also apply, and these will vary depending on which state you live in. It's important to consult with a tax professional or use reliable tax software to assist with calculating your specific tax obligations.",

            "Whether you're self-employed or not, knowing exactly how much tax you will pay is not always an easy task.  Various actions you can take (e.g., charitable donations, IRA contributions, selling stocks) may increase or reduce your tax liability. One tool I've found useful for estimating federal taxes is the Excel 1040 spreadsheet.  This is a spreadsheet version of the income tax return form.  It is not official and is not created by the IRS, but is maintained as a labor of love by a private individual.  In practice, however, it is pretty much an accurate implementation of the tax calculation algorithms encoded in the tax forms and instructions. The nice thing about it is that it's a spreadsheet.  You can plug numbers into various slots in the spreadsheet and see how they affect your federal tax liability.  (You may also owe state taxes depending on what state you live in.)  Of course, the estimates you get by doing this are only (at most) as accurate as your estimates of the various numbers you plug in.  Still, I think it's a free and useful way to get a ballpark estimate of your tax liability based on numbers that you can more easily estimate (e.g., how much money you expect to earn).",
            "The amount of the income taxes you will owe depends upon how much income you have, after valid business expenses, also it will depend upon your filing status as well as the ownership form of your business and what state you live in.  That said, you will need to be sure to make the Federal 1040ES quarterly prepayments of your tax on time or there will be penalties. You also must remember that you will be needing to file a schedule SE with your 1040.  That is for the social security taxes you owe, which is in addition to your income taxes. With an employer/employee situation, the FICA withhoding you have seen on your paycheck are matched by the same payment by your employer.  Now that you are self-employed you are responcible for your share and the employer share as well; in this situation it is known as self-employment tax.  the amount of it will be the same as your share of FICA and half of the employer's share of FICA taxes.  If you are married and your wife also is working self-employed, then she will have to files herown schedule SE along with yours.  meaning that you will pay based on your business income and she will pay baed on hers. your 1040Es quarterly prepayment must cover your income tax and your combined (yours and hers) Self Employment taxes.  Many people will debate on the final results of the results of schedule SE vrs an employee's and an employer's payments combined.  If one were to provides a ball park percentage that would likely apply to you final total addition to your tax libility as a result of needing schedule SE would tend to fluctuate depending upon your total tax situation; many would debate it.  It has been this way since, I first studied and use this schedule decades ago.  For this reason it is best for you to review these PDF documents, Form 1040 Schedule SE Instructions and Form 1040 Schedule SE. As for your state income taxes, it will depend on the laws of the state you are based in."

        "question": "Is it bad practice to invest in stocks that fluctuate by single points throughout the day?",
        "answer": "Investing in stocks that exhibit daily fluctuations isn't inherently bad practice, but it's important to note that it's not the investing in volatile stocks per se that gets you into trouble; rather, it's the rapid buying and selling and attempting to time the market that can be costly. This often occurs when an investor assumes that stock prices are more likely to rise than fall, which may not always be the case. So it is essential to have a well-researched strategy and to understand the risks involved in trying to capitalize on short-term market movements.",

            "\"Yes. There are several downsides to this strategy: You aren't taking into account commissions. If you pay $5 each time you buy or sell a stock, you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts. This next point sounds obvious, but remember that you pay a commission on every trade regardless of profit, so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions. Even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not, if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this, your commissions may eat away all of your profits. Commissions represent a fixed cost, so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade. Since you're in the US, you're required to follow the SEC rules on pattern day trading. From that link, \"\"FINRA rules define a \u201cpattern day trader\u201d as any customer who executes four or more \u201cday trades\u201d within five business days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of the customer\u2019s total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period.\"\" If you trip this rule, you'll be required to maintain $25,000 in a margin brokerage account. If you can't maintain the balance, your account will be locked. Don't forget about capital gains taxes. Since you're holding these securities for less than a year, your gains will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. You can deduct your capital losses too (assuming you don't repurchase the same security within 30 days, because in that case, the wash sale rule prevents you from deducting the loss), but it's important to think about gains and losses in real terms, not nominal terms. The story is different if you make these trades in a tax-sheltered account like an IRA, but the other problems still apply. You're implicitly assuming that the stock's prices are skewed in the positive direction. Remember that you have limit orders placed at the upper and lower bounds of the range, so if the stock price decreases before it increases, your limit order at the lower bound will be triggered and you'll trade at a loss. If you're hoping to make a profit through buying low and selling high, you want a stock that hits its upper bound before hitting the lower bound the majority of the time. Unless you have data analysis (not just your intuition or a pattern you've talked yourself into from looking at a chart) to back this up, you're essentially gambling that more often than not, the stock price will increase before it decreases. It's dangerous to use any strategy that you haven't backtested extensively. Find several months or years of historical data, either intra-day or daily data, depending on the time frame you're using to trade, and simulate your strategy exactly. This helps you determine the potential profitability of your strategy, and it also forces you to decide on a plan for precisely when you want to invest. Do you invest as soon as the stock trades in a range (which algorithms can determine far better than intuition)? It also helps you figure out how to manage your risk and how much loss you're willing to accept. For risk management, using limit orders is a start, but see my point above about positively skewed prices. Limit orders aren't enough. In general, if an active investment strategy seems like a \"\"no-brainer\"\" or too good to be true, it's probably not viable. In general, as a retail investor, it's foolish to assume that no one else has thought of your simple active strategy to make easy money. I can promise you that someone has thought of it. Trading firms have quantitative researchers that are paid to think of and implement trading strategies all the time.  If it's viable at any scale, they'll probably already have utilized it and arbitraged away the potential for small traders to make significant gains. Trust me, you're not the first person who thought of using limit orders to make \"\"easy money\"\" off volatile stocks. The fact that you're asking here and doing research before implementing this strategy, however, means that you're on the right track. It's always wise to research a strategy extensively before deploying it in the wild. To answer the question in your title, since it could be interpreted a little differently than the body of the question: No, there's nothing wrong with investing in volatile stocks, indexes, etc. I certainly do, and I'm sure many others on this site do as well. It's not the investing that gets you into trouble and costs you a lot of money; it's the rapid buying and selling and attempting to time the market that proves costly, which is what you're doing when you implicitly bet that the distribution of the stock's prices is positively skewed. To address the commission fee problem, assuming a fee of $8 per trade ... and a minimum of $100 profit per sale Commissions aren't your only problem, and counting on $100 profit per sale is a significant assumption. Look at point #4 above. Through your use of limit orders, you're making the implicit assumption that, more often than not, the price will trigger your upper limit order before your lower limit order. Here's a simple example; let's assume you have limit orders placed at +2 and -2 of your purchase price, and that triggering the limit order at +2 earns you $100 profit, while triggering the limit order at -2 incurs a loss of $100. Assume your commission is $5 on each trade.  If your upper limit order is triggered, you earn a profit of 100 - 10 = 90, then set up the same set of limit orders again. If your lower limit order is triggered this time, you incur a loss of 100 + 10 = 110, so your net gain is 90 - 110 = -20. This is a perfect example of why, when taking into account transaction costs, even strategies that at first glance seem profitable mathematically can actually fail.  If you set up the same situation again and incur a loss again (100 + 10 = 110), you're now down -20 - 110 = -130. To make a profit, you need to make two profitable trades, without incurring further losses.  This is why point #4 is so important. Whenever you trade, it's critical to completely understand the risk you're taking and the bet you're actually making, not just the bet you think you're making. Also, according to my \"\"algorithm\"\" a sale only takes place once the stock rises by 1 or 2 points; otherwise the stock is held until it does. Does this mean you've removed the lower limit order? If yes, then you expose yourself to downside risk. What if the stock has traded within a range, then suddenly starts declining because of bad earnings reports or systemic risks (to name a few)? If you haven't removed the lower limit order, then point #4 still stands.  However, I never specified that the trades have to be done within the same day.  Let the investor open up 5 brokerage accounts at 5 different firms (for safeguarding against being labeled a \"\"Pattern Day Trader\"\"). Each account may only hold 1 security at any time, for the span of 1 business week. How do you control how long the security is held? You're using limit orders, which will be triggered when the stock price hits a certain level, regardless of when that happens. Maybe that will happen within a week, or maybe it will happen within the same day. Once again, the bet you're actually making is different from the bet you think you're making. Can you provide some algorithms or methods that do work for generating some extra cash on the side, aside from purchasing S&P 500 type index funds and waiting? When I purchase index funds, it's not to generate extra liquid cash on the side. I don't invest nearly enough to be able to purchase an index fund and earn substantial dividends. I don't want to get into any specific strategies because I'm not in the business of making investment recommendations, and I don't want to start. Furthermore, I don't think explicit investment recommendations are welcome here (unless it's describing why something is a bad idea), and I agree with that policy. I will make a couple of points, however. Understand your goals. Are you investing for retirement or a shorter horizon, e.g. some side income? You seem to know this already, but I include it for future readers.  If a strategy seems too good to be true, it probably is. Educate yourself before designing a strategy. Research fundamental analysis, different types of orders (e.g., so you fully understand that you don't have control over when limit orders are executed), different sectors of the market if that's where your interests lie, etc. Personally, I find some sectors fascinating, so researching them thoroughly allows me to make informed investment decisions as well as learn about something that interests me. Understand your limits. How much money are you willing to risk and possibly lose? Do you have a risk management strategy in place to prevent unexpected losses? What are the costs of the risk management itself? Backtest, backtest, backtest. Ideally your backtesting and simulating should be identical to actual market conditions and incorporate all transaction costs and a wide range of historical data. Get other opinions. Evaluate those opinions with the same critical eye as I and others have evaluated your proposed strategy.\"",

            "Its hard to write much in those comment boxes, so I'll just make an answer, although its really not a formal answer. Regarding commissions, it costs me $5 per trade, so that's actually $10 per trade ($5 to buy, $5 to sell).  An ETF like TNA ($58 per share currently) fluctuates $1 or $2 per day.  IXC is $40 per share and fluctuates nearly 50 cents per day (a little less).  So to make any decent money per trade would mean a share size of 50 shares TNA which means I need $2900 in cash (TNA is not marginable). If it goes up $1 and I sell, that's $10 for the broker and $40 for me.  I would consider this to be the minimum share size for TNA.  For IXC, 100 shares would cost me $4000 / 2 = $2000 since IXC is marginable.  If IXC goes up 50 cents, that's $10 for the broker and $40 for me.  IXC also pays a decent dividend.  TNA does not.  You'll notice the amount of cash needed to capture these gains is roughly the same. (Actually, to capture daily moves in IXC, you'll need a bit more than $2000 because it doesn't vary quite a full 50 cents each day). At first, I thought you were describing range trading or stock channeling, but those systems require stop losses when the range or channel is broken.  You're now talking about holding forever until you get 1 or 2 points of profit.  Therefore, I wouldn't trade stocks at all.  Stocks could go to zero, ETFs will not.  It seems to me you're looking for a way to generate small, consistent returns and you're not seeking to strike it rich in one trade.  Therefore, buying something that pays a dividend would be a good idea if you plan to hold forever while waiting for your 1 or 2 points. In your system you're also going to have to define when to get back in the trade.  If you buy IXC now at $40 and it goes to $41 and you sell, do you wait for it to come back to $40?  What if it never does?  Are you happy with having only made one trade for $40 profit in your lifetime?  What if it goes up to $45 and then dips to $42, do you buy at $42?  If so, what stops you from eventually buying at the tippy top?  Or even worse, what stops you from feeling even more confident at the top and buying bigger lots?  If it gets to $49, surely it will cover that last buck to $50, right? /sarc What if you bought IXC at $40 and it went down.  Now what?  Do you take up gardening as a hobby while waiting for IXC to come back?  Do you buy more at lower prices and average down?  Do you find other stocks to trade?  If so, how long until you run out of money and you start getting margin calls?  Then you'll be forced to sell at the bottom when you should be buying more. All these systems seem easy, but when you actually get in there and try to use them, you'll find they're not so easy.  Anything that is obvious, won't work anymore.  And even when you find something that is obvious and bet that it stops working, you'll be wrong then too.  The thing is, if you think of it, many others just like you also think of it... therefore it can't work because everyone can't make money in stocks just like everyone at the poker table can't make money.  If you can make 1% or 2% per day on your money, that's actually quite good and not too many people can do that.  Or maybe its better to say, if you can make 2% per trade, and not take a 50% loss per 10 trades, you're doing quite well. If you make $40 per trade profit while working with $2-3k and you do that 50 times per year (50 trades is not a lot in a year), you've doubled your money for the year.  Who does that on a consistent basis?  To expect that kind of performance is just unrealistic.  It much easier to earn $2k with $100k than it is to double $2k in a year.  In stocks, money flows TO those who have it and FROM those who don't. You have to plan for all possibilities, form a system then stick to it, and not take on too much risk or expect big (unrealistic) rewards. Daytrading You make 4 roundtrips in 5 days, that broker labels you a pattern daytrader.  Once you're labeled, its for life at that brokerage.  If you switch to a new broker, the new broker doesn't know your dealings with the old broker, therefore you'll have to establish a new pattern with the new broker in order to be labeled.  If the SEC were to ask, the broker would have to say 'yes' or 'no' concering if you established a pattern of daytrading at that brokerage. Suppose you make the 4 roundtrips and then you make a 5th that triggers the call.  The broker will call you up and say you either need to deposit enough to bring your account to $25k or you need to never make another daytrade at that firm... ever!  That's the only warning you'll ever get.  If you're in violation again, they lock your account to closing positions until you send in funds to bring the balance up to $25k.  All you need to do is have the money hit your account, you can take it right back out again.  Once your account has $25k, you're allowed to trade again.... even if you remove $15k of it that same day.  If you trigger the call again, you have to send the $15k back in, then take it back out. Having the label is not all bad... they give you 4x margin.  So with $25k, you can buy $100k of marginable stock.  I don't know... that could be a bad thing too.  You could get a margin call at the end of the day for owning $100k of stock when you're only allowed to own $50k overnight.  I believe that's a fed call and its a pretty big deal.",
            "The strategy has intrinsic value, which may or may not be obstructed in practice by details mentioned in other answers (tax and other overheads, regulation, risk). John Bensin says that as a general principle, if a simple technical analysis is good then someone will have implemented it before you. That's fair, but we can do better than an existence proof for this particular case, we can point to who is doing approximately this. Market makers are already doing this with different numbers. They quote a buy price and a sell price on the same stock, so they are already buying low and selling high with a small margin. If your strategy works in practice, that means you can make low-risk money from short-term volatility that they're missing out on, by setting your margin at approximately the daily price variation instead of the current bid-offer spread. But market makers choose their own bid-offer spread, and they choose it because they think it's the best margin to make low-risk money in the long run. So you'd be relying that:"

        "question": "Any reason to keep around my account with my old, 'big' bank?",
        "answer": "There are a few considerations when it comes to the question of whether to keep an account with a large bank. One common concern involves credit cards that are not being used, which can sometimes be closed by the bank due to inactivity. If these accounts are kept open, it is often recommended to charge something to them periodically to prevent them from being closed, but this can create an additional burden and bill to manage.\n\nWhen it comes to the potential impact of closing accounts on your credit score, the advice can vary. The general concerns are that closing accounts can increase your credit utilization ratio and decrease your average account age, which may negatively impact your credit score. However, the real effect on your score depends on several factors, including your current credit score, your need for a high score in the near future, and whether you're currently working on eliminating any credit card debt.\n\nIf your credit score is already high (e.g., mid 700's or higher), closing unused accounts may not significantly affect you. If you have credit card debt, working on paying it off will improve your credit score over time, as utilization only has a temporary effect. The average account age may or may not improve when closing accounts, depending on how old they are relative to the accounts you keep open.\n\nThe document concludes with the advice that making timely payments, focusing on getting out of debt, and maintaining a good credit score are more important than keeping unwanted accounts open solely based on what others advise. Ultimately, whether or not to keep an old account with a large bank will depend on your individual circumstances and financial goals.",

            "\"From my experience, payments from banks and other financial entities, such as loyalty programs, generally aren't as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank. Thus, keeping a bank account open simply for some reward/loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons. The more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ACH payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services. Perhaps the biggest tell that you're in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account.  For example: If you had a direct deposit to your BMO bank account, make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account. If you're making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account, make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account. You shouldn't need to move the auto loan, but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account.  Some financial advisors, such as in this BankRate article titled, Lenders can tap bank account for mortgage, even recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations. If for whatever reason your financial situation turned bleak, it would be more difficult for the bank to help itself to what's in your checking account. To avoid getting nickel and dimed to death by \"\"payment processing fees\"\", I tend to pay insurance bills yearly or semi-annually. Thus, consider if there is anything that may be coming due in the next 6 months. If so, you might want to get your new account hooked up while you still have all the routing numbers and account numbers in your head. It's a pain to dig this stuff up while also rushing to not be late. If all that is in order, close the account.\"",
            "I'd add that bigger banks tend to have experience doing more complicated things. As an example, my local credit union (~12 offices), simply didn't have the software to wire money to a Canadian bank, as where Chase did.  The Canadian routing number wasn't in the format of a US institution, and their software user interface just didn't allow for that number to be entered.  Also, most smaller banks don't have international toll free (in-country) numbers for foreign access. Smaller banks also tend to have less sophisticated business banking tools and experience. If you take a Treasury bond approval to a small bank, they'll generally look at you like you have three heads. So the international side of things is definitely in the favor of big banks; they have a lot more money to dump on services."

For many people, especially as the bookkeeping becomes more complex, that isn't a good investment of their time. The otherwise billable time it would take them to maintain the spreadsheet is worth more than the cost of buying an off-the-shelf product, and the product offers features that they wouldn't get around to adding to their own solution. Add to that the question of whether people find creating and tweaking spreadsheets rewarding or annoying. The right tool is always the one that lets you focus on what you actually care about, unless the cost is too high to justify it.Most folks care about getting the accounting task done a least cost/least efprt. Buying a solution is least effort; if the real cost including time/effort is also lower, that's the direction they're going to go. I maintained my own accounts, and did my taxes, in spreadsheets for quite some time. These days the time to do so, multiplied by what my time is worth, would exceed the cost of buying tools, and the commercial tools are more pleasant to use, less prone to accidents, and offer featured that I don't need but appreciate. I still use a stylesheet for one small calculation (rebalancing my invedtments) but thst's because I havean odd corner case the built-in tool doesn't handle well...not that it makes any practival difference, but being slightly off annoyed me.  Your milage, obviously, will vary. Use the tool that suits your needs; others will do likewise.",

        "question": "Capital improvement and depreciation in restaurant LLC",
        "answer": "In the context of a restaurant LLC, for capital improvements and depreciation, you can generally deduct up to $5,000 in the year your business starts, and expenses that exceed this amount will be amortized over 180 months (15 years) according to IRC Sec. 195. The amortization starts when your business is active, meaning you cannot start depreciation until your restaurant is actually open. \n\nMoney spent on start-up or organizational expenses should be capitalized. Expenditures on capital assets should also be capitalized, but they are treated differently for accounting and tax purposes. For instance, costs incurred from filing paperwork for permits would be considered a start-up expense, whereas purchasing a commercial oven represents a capital asset purchase and should be depreciated separately, similar to buying tables and silverware. On the other hand, salary expenses to your employees are considered current expenses and should not be capitalized.\n\nIt's important to note that the structure of your company being an LLC does have implications on how these expenses affect your personal tax return.",

            "First, you should probably have a proper consultation with a licensed tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State). In fact you should have had it before you started, but that ship has sailed. You're talking about start-up expenses. You can generally deduct up to $5000 in the year your business starts, and the expenses in excess will be amortized over 180 months (15 years). This is per the IRC Sec. 195. The amortization starts when your business is active (i.e.: you can buy the property, but not actually open the restaurant - you cannot start the depreciation). I have a couple questions about accounting - should all the money I   spent be a part of capital spending? Or is it just a part of it? If it qualifies as start-up/organizational expenses - it should be capitalized. If it is spent on capital assets - then it should also be capitalized, but for different reasons and differently. For example, costs of filing paperwork for permits is a start-up expense. Buying a commercial oven is a capital asset purchase which should be depreciated separately, as buying the tables and silverware. If it is a salary expense to your employees - then it is a current expense and shouldn't be capitalized. Our company is LLC if this matters.  It matters to how it affects your personal tax return."

        "question": "How long do credit cards keep working after you disappear?",
        "answer": "The information concerning credit cards tends to focus more on what happens with the account in terms of reporting to credit bureaus and the maintenance of the credit score when account numbers change, rather than the specific scenario of an account owner's disappearance. \n\nHowever, one thing that is clear from the information is that changes to the credit card account number, such as in the case of issuing a replacement credit card, do not affect the credit score because the account itself remains the same, preserving the history of payments and the age of accounts. \n\nThis suggests that as long as the credit card issuer is not notified of the disappearance and does not receive instructions to close the account or flag it for unusual activity, the credit card could continue to work as it normally would. The operations manager at FICO mentions that issuers typically transfer the account history to a new trade line, should it be necessary, indicating that financial institutions aim to maintain continuity unless there's a significant reason to alter the status of the account.\n\nIn the event of a disappearance, actions might depend on whether the account is flagged by the issuer for suspicious activity, whether the credit card is reported lost or stolen, and whether there is someone legally appointed to manage the affairs of the missing person. Without any of these triggers, the credit card may potentially remain active and could be used until the issuer steps in due to missed payments, suspicious patterns of usage, or upon being notified of the account owner's situation. \n\nIt's imperative to notify the credit card issuer as soon as possible if a card owner goes missing, to prevent misuse and financial complications.",

        "answer": "To set up QuickBooks for a small property rental company with properties held in separate LLCs, you should follow these broad steps:\n\n1. Incorporate Your Business: Protect your private financial life by forming a company. The company will own the properties, hire maintenance staff, property managers, security staff, or any similar employment activities. The company will also be responsible for taking out insurance and paying taxes.\n\n2. Create Separate QuickBooks Files: For each separate LLC, you may need to create a separate QuickBooks file to keep the financials distinct. This will help maintain clear separation between different properties and related transactions.\n\n3. Chart of Accounts: Set up a chart of accounts that includes categories relevant to real estate operations, such as rental income, maintenance expenses, capital improvements, insurance, and property taxes.\n\n4. Track Rental Income and Expenses: Use QuickBooks to track all rental income and expenses for each property. Categorize them according to the chart of accounts.\n\n5. Manage Tenant Information: Keep all tenant lease agreements, payment details, and communication records in QuickBooks, or integrate with a property management software that syncs with QuickBooks if more specialized features are needed.\n\n6. Automate Recurring Transactions: In QuickBooks, set up recurring invoices for rent payments and automate reminders for tenants.\n\n7. Run Regular Reports: Generate profit and loss, balance sheet, and cash flow statements regularly to monitor the financial health of each LLC.\n\n8. Maintain Liability Protection: Consider the structure of your LLCs to ensure you have appropriate liability protection. In some cases, you might have an LLC that owns the property and leases it to a property management company, providing an extra layer of liability protection.\n\n9. Professional Consultation: Seek advice from a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who specializes in real estate for proper tax planning and a legal advisor for structure and liability considerations.\n\nRemember, this is a high-level overview.

Additionally, it's recommended to start by checking the list of mortgage companies approved to work in your area, as this can provide you with a selection of legitimate lenders to consider.\n\nYou should also:\n\n1. Check if the lender is listed on the HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) website, which maintains a list of approved lenders.\n2. Review consumer feedback and customer service experiences, though be cautious and discerning when interpreting online reviews.\n3. Verify the rates offered against the prevailing rates for your current situation, which can be checked with your preferred bank or through various online sites to compare multiple quotes.\n4. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) can be a resource for checking a company's reputation, but don't rely solely on their recommendations.\n   \nIt's important to conduct thorough research to ensure that the lender is not only reputable but also offers competitive rates and terms that suit your financial situation.",

Rates are very low at the moment so it is likely that rates from reputable lenders are 1 to 2%  lower than say a year or 2 years ago.  In general if a lender gives you a GFE the numbers on it are going to be pretty accurate and there isn't a great deal of wiggle room for the lender so the concerns with reputation should focus on is this outfit some type of scam and then reviews on how good or bad their customer service is. Chances of running into a scam seem pretty low but the costs could be really high. As far as checking if an unknown lender is any good it is kind of tough to do. There is a list of Lenders on HUD's site. Checking BBB can't hurt but I wouldn't put a lot of stock into their recommendations.

Pick ones you know because they are established businesses in your area, region, or even nationally.   A good place to start might be with your current lender. The risk you seem to be worried about is a scam or a trick. In the recent past the scams were ones where the home owner didn't understand teaser rates, and the risk of interest only and pick-your-payment loans. The simpler the bells and whistles, the less likely you are to be embarking on a risky transaction. It can't hurt to ask an organization like the BBB or neighbors, but realize that many people loved their exotic mortgage until the moment it blew up in their face. So for 5 years your neighbor would have raved about their new mortgage until they discovered how underwater they were.  Regarding how smoothy the transaction is accomplished, is hard to predict. There is great variation in the quality of the loan officers, so a great company can have rookie employees. Unless you can get a recommendation for a specific employee it is hard know if your loan officer is going to give great service.   When getting a mortgage for a purchase, the biggest risk is getting a mortgage that results in a payment you can't afford. This is less of a risk with a refinance because you already have a mortgage and monthly payment. But keep in mind some of the monthly savings is due to stretching out the payments for another 30 years. Know what you are trying to do with the refinance because the streamlined ones cant be used for cash out."

        "answer": "The decision to open a second bank account depends on your financial objectives and situation. If you are comfortable with having a minimal or zero income from the account and aim to avoid negative interest rates that might be charged on larger balances, opening multiple accounts can be beneficial. Some banks charge negative interest only above certain thresholds (for example, CHF 100,000), so spreading your funds across different accounts might help you stay below those thresholds and avoid the negative interest rates.\n\nHowever, you should also consider your need for liquidity and the potential trade-off between liquidity and profitability. If you want to earn an income from your funds, you'll likely need to look at longer-term investments or accept more risk than you would with a standard savings account.\n\nBefore proceeding, it might be wise to discuss your personal financial goals and situation with a financial advisor or a bank-independent advisor, who can provide a tailored investment proposal and guidance on whether opening a second bank account aligns with your financial strategies.",

Therefore, for tax purposes, the money in the LLC is treated as your personal income, and there is no need to pay yourself a salary. Instead, you would take distributions from the LLC, which would be reported as taxable income on your personal tax return. This pass-through taxation means that you would be responsible for taxes typically covered by an employer, such as self-employment tax and social security tax, in addition to income tax.\n\nMoreover, the United States has tax treaties with various countries that can impact your tax liability. While the document does not specifically mention France, it does illustrate an example with Italy, where a favorable treaty with the US could reduce federal taxes to as low as 5% or allow for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, which might reduce federal tax to zero on the first $95,100 earned abroad. However, then you may face the host country's taxes, which in the example of Italy, could be 20%+. It is important to look into the tax treaty specifics between the US and France to understand how it might affect your situation and whether similar benefits apply.\n\nIn summary, taxation for remote work can be complex due to the different rules that apply and the potential impact of international tax treaties.

        "answer": "Withdrawing money from an LLC is typically done through a process known as a \"distribution.\" It involves paying yourself some or all of the proceeds of the business, depending on how your LLC is set up. This can be done on a regular schedule, like monthly, or at the end of the year. The technical method for making a withdrawal is as simple as writing yourself a check from the LLC's business account or transferring money between your personal and business accounts. However, make sure your operating agreement explicitly authorizes such withdrawals.\n\nPlease note the following:\n\n1. Tax Consequences: Distributions from an LLC are reported on your personal income tax as taxable income. The LLC uses pass-through taxation, meaning whatever the principals receive in distribution is personally taxable. This includes taxes usually covered by an employer, such as self-employment tax, social security tax, and income tax.\n\n2. Legal Considerations: It's crucial to ensure that withdrawals are done in a way that does not jeopardize the LLC's liability protection. Inappropriate withdrawals could lead to a \"piercing of the corporate veil,\" making you personally liable for LLC debts or obligations.\n\n3. Disregarded Entity: For single-member LLCs, the IRS often treats them as \"disregarded entities.\" This means for tax purposes, the entity is essentially the same as the owner. However, within the operations of the LLC, owners should maintain a clear separation between their personal and business transactions to protect the limited liability feature.\n\nMake sure you maintain proper documentation and adhere to your LLC's operating agreement to mitigate any legal risks. It would also be prudent to consult with a CPA or legal advisor to ensure you're following the best practices for your situation and jurisdiction.",

            "Generally, unless you explicitly elect otherwise, LLCs are transparent when it comes to taxes. So the money in the LLC is your money for tax purposes, there's no need to pay yourself a salary. In fact, the concept of salary for LLC members doesn't exist at all. It is either distributions or guaranteed payments (and even that is mostly relevant to multi-member LLCs). The only concern is the separation of personal and LLC finances - avoiding commingling. Mixing your personal and business expenses by using the same accounts/cards for both business and personal spending may cause troubles when it comes to the liability protection in case of a lawsuit. I'd suggest discussing this with a FL-licensed attorney. Bottom line - technically the withdrawal is just writing yourself a check from the business account or moving money between your personal and business accounts. If you're a sole member - you need not more than that. Make sure the operating agreement explicitly empowers you to do that, of course. There are no tax consequences, but as I mentioned - there may be legal consequences.",

Keep in mind that you'll have to pay ALL of the taxes normally covered by an employer, such as self-employment tax (usually about 15%), social security tax, and so on.

It's important to do thorough research or consult with a financial advisor to make informed decisions.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general types of investment options that people often consider:\n\n1. **Savings Account**: A low-risk place to keep your money that earns interest over time.\n2. **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)**: Offers a fixed interest rate for a set term with low risk.\n3. **Stocks**: Buying shares of companies, higher potential returns with higher risk.\n4. **Bonds**: Lending money to a company or government in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value when it matures. Lower risk compared to stocks.\n5. **Mutual Funds**: A collection of stocks, bonds, or other securities managed by a professional. Offers diversification.\n6. **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: Similar to mutual funds, but traded on stock exchanges.\n7. **Real Estate**: Investing in property can provide rental income and potential property appreciation.\n8. **Retirement Accounts (IRA, 401(k))**: Accounts with tax advantages for retirement savings.\n9. **Commodities**: Investing in physical goods like gold, oil, or agricultural products.\n10. **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security.\n\nRemember, all investments come with risks, and it's crucial to understand them before investing your savings.

            "Basically the first thing you should do before you invest your money is to learn about investing and learn about what you want to invest in. Another thing to think about is that usually low risk can also mean low returns. As you are quite young and have some savings put aside you should generally aim for higher risk higher return investments and then when you start to reach retirement age aim for less risky lower return investments. In saying that, just because an investment is considered high risk does not mean you have to be exposed to the full risk of that investment. You do this by managing your risk to an acceptable level which will allow you to sleep at night. To do this you need to learn about what you are investing in. As an example about managing your risk in an investment, say you want to invest $50,000 in shares. If you put the full $50,000 into one share and that share price drops dramatically you will lose a large portion of your money straight away. If instead you spent a maximum of $10,000 on 5 different shares, even if one of them falls dramatically, you still have another 4 which may be doing a lot better thus minimising your losses. To take it one step further you might say if anyone of the shares you bought falls by 20% then you will sell those shares and limit your losses to $2000 per share. If the worst case scenario occurred and all 5 of your shares fell during a stock market crash you would limit your total losses to $10,000 instead of $50,000. Most successful investors put just as much if not more emphasis on managing the risk on their investments and limiting their losses as they do in selecting the investments. As I am not in the US, I cannot really comment whether it is the right time to buy property over there, especially as the market conditions would be different in different states and in different areas of each state. However, a good indication of when to buy properties is when prices have dropped and are starting to stabilise. As you are renting at the moment one option you might want to look at is buying a place to live in so you don't need to rent any more. You can compare your current rent payment with the mortgage payment if you were to buy a house to live in. If your mortgage payments are lower than your rent payments then this could be a good option. But whatever you do make sure you learn about it first. Make sure you spend the time looking at for sale properties for a few months in the area you want to buy before you do buy. This will give you an indication of how much properties in that area are really worth and if prices are stable, still falling or starting to go up. Good luck, and remember, research, research and more research. Even if you are to take someone elses advice and recommendations, you should learn enough yourself to be able to tell if their advice and recommendations make sense and are right for your current situation.",
            "Since you mention the religion restriction, you should probably look into the stock market or funds investing in it. Owning stock basically means you own a part of a company and benefit from any increase in value the company may have (and 'loose' on decreases, provided you sell your stock) and you also earn dividends over the company's profit. If you do your research properly and buy into stable companies you shouldn't need to bother about temporary market movements or crashes (do pay attention to deterioration on the businesses you own though). When buying stocks you should be aiming for the very long run. As mentioned by Victor, do your research, I recommend you start it by looking into 'value stocks' should you choose that path."

        "question": "How common is \u201cpass-through\u201d health insurance?",
        "answer": "The information provided in the document does not give a direct answer to how common \"pass-through\" health insurance is, but it gives context on how health insurance can vary by state in the United States. It explains that like most forms of insurance, health insurance is regulated at the state level and the availability of options depends on the state you live in. Furthermore, the document mentions that many states provide \"insurance of last resort\" for individuals who cannot obtain insurance through private companies, and professional and trade associations may offer group insurance plans similar to COBRA coverage without the benefit of an employer paying a significant portion of the premiums.\n\nThis suggests that there are various ways in which individuals can get health insurance apart from through an employer (which may, or may not, include \"pass-through\" insurance), but it does not provide specific data on the prevalence of \"pass-through\" health insurance itself. \"Pass-through\" health insurance is a term that could refer to a few different situations (e.g., insurance costs passed through to employees or self-insured plans where claims are passed through an insurance company for processing), but without further context, it's hard to give a precise answer. If \"pass-through\" refers to a specific type of health insurance framework or product, you may need to consult industry reports or specific insurance market analyses to get an idea of how common it is.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Even though this isn't really personal finance related I still feel like there are some misconceptions here that could be addressed. I don't know where you got the phrase \"\"pass-through\"\" insurance from.  What you're describing is a self-funded plan.  In a self-funded arrangement an employer contracts a third-party-administrator (TPA), usually one of the big health insurance carriers, to use it's provider network, process and adjudicate claims, etc.  In addition to the TPA there will be some sort of stop-loss insurance coverage on each participant.  Stop-loss coverage usually provides a maximum amount of risk on a given member and on the entire population for a given month and/or year and/or lifetime.  The employer's risk is in between the plan deductible and the stop loss coverage (assuming the stop-loss doesn't have a maximum). Almost all of the claim dollars in a given plan will come from very very few people.  These costs typically arise out of very unforeseen diagnoses not chronic issues.  A cancer patient can easily cost $1,000,000 in a year.  Someone's diabetes maintenance medicine or other chronic maintenance will cost no where near what a botched surgery will in a year. If we take a step back there are really four categories of employer insurance. Small group is tightly regulated.  Usually plan premiums are filed with a state authority, there is no negotiating, your group's underwriting performance has zero impact on your premiums.   Employers have no way of obtaining any medical/claim information on employees. Mid-market is a pooled arrangement.  The overall pool has a total increase, and your particular group performs better or worse than the pool which may impact premiums.  Employers get very minor claims data, things like the few highest claims, or number of claims over a certain threshold, but no employee specific information. Large-group is a mostly unpooled arrangement.  Generally your group receives it's own rating based on its individual underwriting performance.  In general the carrier is offloading some risk to a stop-loss carrier and employer's get a fair amount of insight in to claims, though again, not with employee names. Self-funded is obviously self-contained.  The employer sets up a claims checking account.  The TPA has draft authority on the account.  The employee's typically have no idea the plan is self funded, their ID cards will have the carrier logo, and the carrier deals with them just as it would any other member.  Generally when a company is this size it has a separate benefits committee, those few people will have some level of insight in to claims performance and stop-loss activity.  This committee will have nothing to do with the hiring process. There are some new partially self-funded arrangements, which is just a really low-threshold  (and relatively expensive) stop-loss program, that's becoming somewhat popular in the mid-market group size as employers attempt to reduce medical spend.   I think when you start thinking on a micro, single employee level, you really lose sight of the big picture.  Why would an employer hire this guy who has this disease/chronic problem that costs $50,000 per year?  And logically you can get to the conclusion that with a self-funded plan it literally costs the company the money so the company has an incentive not to hire the person.  I understand the logic of the argument, but at the self funded level the plan is typically costing north of half a million dollars each month.  So a mid-level HR hiring manager 1. isn't aware of specific plan claims or costs and is not part of the benefits executive committee, 2. won't be instructed to screen for health deficiencies because it's against the law, 3. a company generally won't test the water here because $50,000 per year is less than 1% of the company's annual medical expenses, 4. $50,000 is well below the cost to litigate a discrimination law-suit.    Really the flaw in your thought process is that $50,000 in annual medical expense is a lot.  A harsh child-birth can run in the $250,000 range, so these companies never hire women?  Or never hire men who could add a spouse who's in child bearing years?  Or never hire women who might have a female spouse who could be in child bearing years?  A leukemia diagnosis will ratchet up $1,000,000 in a year.  Spend a bit of time in intensive care for $25,000 per day and you're fired?  A few thousand bucks on diabetes meds isn't anything relative to the annual cost of your average self-funded plan. The second flaw is that the hiring managers get insight in to specific claims.  They don't. Third, you don't hand over medical records on your resume anyway. I typed this out in one single draft and have no intention of editing anything.  I just wanted paint a broad picture, I'm sure things can be nit-picked or focused on.\""

        "answer": "Disputed debts work on credit reports by placing the responsibility on the parties that have reported the adverse items to attest to their validity. When you are reviewing your credit report (for example, on TransUnion), you have the option to dispute any negative items. By initiating a dispute, you require the creditors to provide evidence within 30 days to TransUnion confirming the validity of the negative item. If the creditors do not respond or fail to provide adequate proof, those adverse items may be dropped from your report. Successfully disputing items can result in them being removed from your credit report, which can significantly raise your credit score.

        "answer": "Starting to make and save money at 22 is an ideal time, as it allows for many decades for your money to grow and compound, potentially creating a significant sum for when you're ready to retire if you invest it fairly aggressively. Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n1. Pay off Debt First: Focus on paying down any high-interest debt, such as credit card balances or costly loans, before saving aggressively. The interest on debt can exceed the returns on savings, so eliminating it is a priority. However, it's still wise to save a small amount as an emergency fund.\n\n2. Start Saving Early: Even saving a modest percentage, like 10% of your income, can make a substantial difference over time. If possible, aim to save 15% or more. However, start with what you can afford and increase your savings rate gradually, possibly splitting future raises between additional savings and spending.\n\n3. Investment Education: Learn about your investment options to take control of your financial future rather than relying on others, which could lead to losing money or incurring additional fees. Investing in a way that aligns with your personality and life circumstances is vital, and continuing education in finance and investment can be beneficial.\n\n4. Build an Emergency Fund: Aim to create an emergency fund that can cover at least six months of income. A straightforward approach is to allocate half of your income towards this fund for a year.\n\nRemember that these are general strategies and you should adapt them to your particular financial situation, career goals, and risk tolerance. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.",

I am a big advocate of education (I have a B.Eng) but have following working in the real world for a number of years have started an IT business in data analytics.

I think it is a very good idea to take control of your own destiny and choose how you will invest your money.   I would say similarly that giving your money to someone else who will sometimes lose you money and will charge you for the privilege is a bad idea. Also putting your money in a box under your bed or in the bank and receive interest that is less than inflation are bad ideas. You need to choose where to invest your money otherwise you will gain no advantage from the savings and inflation will erode your buying power.

For the employees, reclassification can mean the retroactive payment of those benefits and possibly the repayment of taxes with possible penalties and interest, depending on the situation. For employers, the reclassification can lead to owed back taxes for payroll, penalties for misclassification, and the responsibility to compensate for any benefits that should have been provided, such as overtime, health insurance, workers' compensation, and unemployment benefits.",

Generally, if you're the sole employee of your own S-Corp, and the whole S-Corp income is from your own personal services, as defined by the IRS - there's no profit there. All the net income from such a S-Corp is subject to SE tax, either through payroll or through your K-1. Claiming anything else would be lying and IRS is notorious for going after people doing that. Second - the reclassification issue. The reason employers classify employees as contractors is to avoid payroll taxes (which the IRS gets through Bob's S-Corp, so it doesn't care) and providing benefits (that is Bob's problem, not the IRS). So in the scenario above, the IRS wouldn't care whose employee Bob is since Bob's S-Corp would have to pay all the same payroll taxes. The reclassification is an issue when employees are abused. See examples of Fedex drivers, where they're classified as contractors and are not getting any benefits, spend their own money on the truck and maintenance, etc. The employees are the ones who sued for reclassification, but in this case the IRS would be interested as well since a huge chunk of payroll taxes was not paid (driver's net is after car maintenance and payments, not before as it would be if he was salaried). So in your scenario reclassification is not as much a concern to Bob as his tax evasion scheme claiming earnings from performing personal services as \"\"profits from S-Corp\"\".

        "question": "How FTB and IRS find mistakes in amended tax returns? Are their processes reliable?",
        "answer": "The Franchise Tax Board (FTB), similar to other government agencies, often operates with a limited staff and budget. When dealing with amended tax returns, there is reliance on both automation and manual review. However, the document suggests that there is \"a lot of automation and very little attention to details when it comes to matching errors\" in the process.\n\nFor the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which is not specifically mentioned in the document, it is known that they utilize a combination of automated systems and manual checks to identify discrepancies in tax returns. The IRS has sophisticated programs to detect errors, such as the Automated Underreporter Program, which compares the information reported by taxpayers with information provided by third parties. Additionally, the IRS employs trained personnel to conduct audits when discrepancies are flagged by their systems.\n\nBoth the FTB and IRS processes have their limitations, and errors can occur due to automation, understaffing, and oversight. It's important to review all communications from these agencies carefully and ensure that accurate information has been considered. If there are errors or an amended return is questioned, taxpayers may need to provide additional documentation or clarification to resolve the issues.",

        "question": "Tax consequences when foreign currency changes in value",
        "answer": "If you are a US citizen, there are specific reporting requirements regarding foreign accounts which you should be aware of. In particular, you are required to file IRS Form TD F 90-22.1, also known as the Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Report (FBAR), annually if you have more than $10,000 in foreign accounts at any time during the calendar year. Additionally, you should research the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which demonstrates the US government's move towards more stringent oversight of foreign accounts. \n\nThese requirements reflect the tax consequences associated with the change in value of foreign currency held in foreign accounts, as gains or income arising from fluctuations in exchange rates could be subject to US taxation and reporting requirements. Always consider consulting a tax professional with experience in international taxation to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and obligations.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "If you buy foreign currency as an investment, then the gains are ordinary income. The gains are realized when you close the position, and whether you buy something else go back to the original form of investment is of no consequence. In case #1 you have $125 income. In case #2 you have $125 income. In case #3 you have $166 loss. You report all these items on your Schedule D. Make sure to calculate the tax correctly, since the tax is not capital gains tax but rather ordinary income at marginal rates. Changes in foreign exchange between a transaction and the conversion of the proceeds to USD are generally not considered as income (i.e.: You sold a property in Mexico, but since the money took a couple of days to clear, the exchange rate changed and you got $2K more/less than you would based on the exchange rate on the day of the transaction - this is not a taxable income/loss). This is covered by the IRC Sec. 988. There are additional rules for contracts on foreign currency, TTM rules, etc. Better talk to a licensed tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State) for anything other than trivial."

        "answer": "Electronic itemized receipts for in-store retail purchases are indeed a possibility, as demonstrated by some stores like the Apple store or Farmers market, where customers receive receipts automatically sent to their email addresses. However, the implementation of such solutions on a wider scale faces several challenges:\n\n1. **Data Sharing Concerns:** When a retailer opts to send an itemized receipt to a credit card company, they are effectively transferring the data they have collected to another corporation. Retailers often collect shopping data to sell to their vendors for marketing and sales strategies. For example, a grocery store may use purchase data to inform vendors that certain demographics are more likely to buy specific products.\n   \n2. **Privacy Issues:** There is also a privacy aspect to consider. Some customers are reluctant to join store reward programs because they do not want the company to track their purchases. There would be even greater privacy concerns if credit card companies were to receive detailed itemized receipts\u2014information that could be used to generate further meta-data for commercial purposes.\n\n3. **Data Management:** If credit card companies were to receive itemized receipts, they would be responsible for the storage, maintenance, and protection of this detailed purchase data. This would require significant infrastructure and could introduce security risks, adding additional layers of complexity and potential cost.\n\nThese factors contribute to the lack of widespread solutions for electronic itemized receipt distribution in the retail industry. Companies weigh the benefits of such systems against the risks and costs involved in managing detailed consumer data before deciding to implement them.",

The credit card companies could gather even more Meta data that they could sell. Privacy. Some people don't join the reward program at the store because they don't want a company to know exactly what they buy. Even fewer would want the credit card company to have that information.

        "question": "Why does FlagStar Bank harass you about payments within grace period?",
        "answer": "FlagStar Bank's practice of contacting customers about mortgage payments during the grace period seems to be a part of their standard procedures. Based on reports and customer complaints, the bank has a policy of initiating robo-calls starting on the 5th of each month to individuals who haven't yet made their mortgage payment. This is likely a result of an increasing number of loan defaults over the past years, pushing the bank to implement such a strategy as a business decision to remind customers to make their payments.\n\nAccording to the information I found, here are some of the approaches you can consider to address this:\n\n1. Confirm the terms of your mortgage to ensure that you're complying with them.\n2. You could potentially set up a dedicated phone line for communications with the bank using a service like Google Voice to avoid disturbance on your primary line.\n3. To stop the calls, you could move the payment date to before the 5th of the month, if possible.\n4. Alternatively, try to get a month ahead on your mortgage payments by using the previous month's rent to pay the current month's mortgage, allowing you to make payments on time.\n\nIt is also important to note that while most mortgage notes require payments on the first of every month, and lenders typically offer a grace period before assessing a late charge, the payment is technically late after the due date (which is often the 2nd). If FlagStar Bank is servicing the loan for another investor, they may be contractually obligated to begin collection activities by a certain date.",

First and foremost, confirm the terms of your mortgage. Based on your story and information provided so far, it sounds like you're legally in the clear to pay as you have been.  It appears that they have an internal policy of firing off robo-caller on the 5th for anyone who hasn't paid their mortgage yet. With the number of individuals defaulting on loans over the past decade, this was probably a simple business decision to aid in reminding people to pay up.  Your 3.5 choices as I see it are: 2a.

But since it is only one of the 4 properties you own, it shouldn't be that big of a risk.",
            "One option is to try to get a month ahead on your mortgage payments.

            "All standard mortgage promissory notes mandate payments are due on the first of every month; I can almost guarantee the note you signed has this provision.  Most lenders offer a grace period of generally 15 days before they assess a late charge, but the payment IS late on the 2nd.  People have become incorrectly accustomed to believe that the payment is due between the 1st and 15th. If they are servicing your loan for another investor (FNMA, FHMLC, a private investor, etc.), they may have contractual requirements to begin collection activities by a certain date. So they are within the rights you granted them.  If these calls really bug you, you can start to adjust your cashflow so you can perhaps make your payment a few days ahead of the first each month."

If they want to try to use a volatile asset as collateral and have to figure out how to cover when the price drops temporarily, great. But why should they put that risk on your other investors who may not be so crazy? Also, this obviously won't meet the investor's concerns anyway. Say the price of bitcoin goes up but you lose 10% of the money you borrowed.

If you just cut them a check, there's nothing stopping them from taking your money and making an insurance claim anyway, or taking your money and then suing for \"\"whiplash\"\" or some other fake injury.

The only way to have it both ways is to trust the other person. From a financial perspective, ultimately you need to decide if the monetary cost of your raised insurance premiums, etc., outweighs the cost of whatever money the other party in the accident will try to squeeze out of you (factoring in the likelihood that they will do so).  You also would need to factor in the likelihood that, rather than trying to scam you, they'll pursue legal action against you. In short, from a purely monetary perspective, if the legitimate cost of repairs is $700 and the cost to you of doing it by the book via insurance is $2000, you should be willing to be scammed for up to $1300, because you'll still come out ahead.  Of course, there are psychological considerations, like whether someone unscrupulous enough to scam you will stop at $1300.  But those numbers are the baseline for whatever outcome calculations you want to do. On the more qualitative side of things, it is possible they're trying to scam you, but also possible they're just trying to hustle you into doing everything quickly without thinking about it.  They may not be trying to gouge you monetarily, they just want to pressure you so they get their money.  I agree with other answerers here that the ideal way would be for them to send you an actual bill after repairs are complete.

        "question": "How is taxation for youtube/twitch etc monetization handled in the UK?",
        "answer": "In the UK, individuals who earn income from activities such as YouTube or Twitch monetization need to inform HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) that they are self-employed as soon as possible to avoid any potential penalties. Here are key points regarding taxation and registration requirements for such income in the UK:\n\n- You are considered to be trading (and thus starting a business) once you advertise or have a customer purchasing your goods or services.\n- It is essential to register with HMRC within six months of the end of the tax year in which you start self-employment. For example, if your tax year ends on 5th April, you should register by 5th October of the same year.\n- If you are making/putting up videos online as a hobby, and the amount you make is relatively small (less than 500 pounds), you may not be classified as \"trading\" and may not need to register with HMRC.\n- If you begin receiving regular payments, a single significant payment, or multiple payments for similar services/items, you are more likely to need to register as self-employed.\n- If you start doing videos as a hobby and make no significant income over an entire tax year plus five months, you might not need to register at all.\n\nFor further clarification, HMRC provides a YouTube channel with helpful videos, including one titled \"Am I Trading or Not?\" which could help distinguish between hobbyist activities and trading that necessitates registration and taxation. \n\nPlease note that this guidance is relevant to self-employment and independent trading, and it would be wise to consult with a tax professional or HMRC directly for personalized advice and to ensure compliance with the current tax laws.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"The HMRC has a dedicated self-help/learning site that is helpful here: It's important to tell HMRC that you are self-employed as soon as   possible.  If you don't, you may have to pay a penalty.  You don't want to pay more to HMRC than you have to as it is a waste   of your money. Your business has started when you start to advertise or you have a   customer to buy your goods or services.  It is at this point that your business is 'trading'. You cannot   register before you start trading. For example, if you advertise your business in the local newspaper on   15 January but do not get your first customer until 29 March; in this   case, you have been trading since 15 January. You must tell HMRC within six months of the end of the tax year in   which you start self-employment.  You must therefore register by 5 October.  But it's best to register well before this so that you do not forget   to do so. The HMRC also has a YouTube channel with help videos, and \"\"Am I Trading or Not?\"\" might be of particular interest to you. Most of the registration is based around the concept of starting to work with the intent to make a profit. By the letter of law and regulations, you should register within six months of the end of the tax year you started to avoid any potential penalty. However note that the situation is different based upon your intent. If you begin making/putting up videos online as a hobby with the hope that you can make something to help you defray the basic costs involved, and the total amount you make is relatively small (say, less than 500 pounds), you will not be classified as \"\"trading\"\" and likely have no need to register with HMRC.  As soon as you begin to get in regular payments, maybe a single payment of a significant size, or multiple payments for a similar service/item, you are vastly more likely to need to register. From my reading you would likely be safe to begin putting up videos without registration, but if you begin spending a large portion of your time over an extended period (multiple months) and/or begin getting payments of any notable size then you should likely register with the appropriate services (HMRC, etc). As is the case in both the USA and UK, simple registration is pretty cheap and the costs of little/no income are usually pretty minor.  Also note that the HMRC trading and self-employment regulations are unusual compared to many US laws/institutions, in that you are explicitly permitted to begin doing something and only register later. So if you start doing videos for an entire tax year + 5 months and make nothing significant, you'd seemingly be fine to never register at all.\"",

Yes, every country I know of allows you to do something as a hobby until it becomes profitable and then change it into a business once it becomes likely to turn a profit.

This basically means that you have the protection of being a company, but all your revenues will go on your personal tax return and be taxed at whatever rate your personal rate calculates to based on your situation.  Now here is the good stuff.  If you file Form 2553 you can change your sole member LLC to file as an S Corp.  Once you have done this it changes the game on how you can pay out what your company makes.  You will need to employ yourself and give a \"\"reasonable\"\" salary.  This will be reported to the IRS and you will file your normal tax returns and they will be taxed based on your situation. Now as the sole member you can then pay yourself \"\"distribution to share holders\"\" from your account and this money is not subject to normal fica and social security tax (check with your tax guy) and MAKE SURE to document correctly.  The other thing is that on that same form you can elect to have a different fiscal year than the standard calendar IRS tax year.  This means that you could then take part of profits in one tax year and part in another so that you don't bump yourself into another tax bracket.  Example:  You cut a deal and the company makes 100,000 in profit that you want to take as a distribution.  If you wrote yourself a check for all of it then it could put you into another tax bracket.  If your fiscal year were to end say on sept 30 and you cut the deal before that date then you could write say 50,000 this year and then on jan 1 write the other check.\"",
            "There is some benefit to creating a corporation or LLC -- you theoretically have a liability shield. As Michael Pryor points out in his answer, though, there will probably be little difference if you get sued. Operating the corporation or LLC incurs some extra costs: you have to pay annual fees to the state, and there's a bit of extra administrative overhead (very little overhead for an LLC though).",
            "I am surprised no one has mentioned the two biggest things (in my opinion).  Or I should say, the two biggest things to me.  First, 1099 have to file quarterly self employment taxes.  I do not know for certain but I have heard that often times you will end up paying more this way then even a W-2 employees.  Second, an LLC allows you to deduct business expenses off the top prior to determining what you pay in taxes as pass-through income.  With 1099 you pay the same taxes regardless of your business expenses unless they are specifically allowed as a 1099 contractor (which most are not I believe).  So what you should really do is figure out the expense you incur as a result of doing your business and check with an accountant to see if those expenses would be deductible in an LLC and if it offsets a decent amount of your income to see if it would be worth it.  But I have read a lot of books and listened to a lot of interviews about wealthy people and most deal in companies not contracts.  Most would open a new business and add clients rather than dealing in 1099 contracts.  Just my two cents... Good luck and much prosperity."

        "question": "I am not VAT registered. Do I need to buy from my supplier with excl VAT prices or incl VAT?",
        "answer": "If you are not VAT registered, you generally cannot reclaim the VAT on purchases you make for your business. This means that you would typically pay for goods and services at the price which includes VAT. However, the way VAT is charged and represented on invoices might vary depending on the supplier's policies and the laws in your country.\n\nTo provide you with the most accurate information, I can check the document you've provided to see if there's any specific guidance on this matter. Would you like me to do that?",
        "ground_truth": [
            "It's quite common for VAT-registered businesses to quote ex-VAT prices for supply to other businesses.  However you're right that when you make an order you will be invoiced and ultimately have to pay the VAT-inclusive price, assuming your supplier is VAT registered.  If you're not clear on this then you should check since it obviously makes quite a difference. Since your business is not VAT-registered you cannot charge VAT to your customers.",
            "If an item costs \u00a310 excluding VAT, and you buy it from a VAT registered company, you will have to pay \u00a312. You sell it for any price you like, and you don't add VAT.  Let's say you set the price at \u00a315 and sell 1000 items for \u00a315. You take \u00a315,000, you spent \u00a312,000, you make \u00a33,000 profit in your pocket and you'll pay taxes according to your profits (\u00a33,000). It doesn't really matter that VAT was involved, it just affects the price that you pay.  If you mostly trade with private customers and not with companies, being not VAT registered is a good idea, since by not having to add VAT you can keep your prices lower. It's different if you trade mostly with VAT-registered companies. In that example, if private customers are willing to pay \u00a315 but not more, if you were VAT registered, you couldn't just charge \u00a315 + VAT = \u00a318, because your customers would stop buying. So you'd have to charge \u00a312.50 + VAT = \u00a315 and make less money.  But if you sell to a company, it doesn't make a difference to them if they pay \u00a315 without VAT or \u00a315 + VAT = \u00a318. You have to send the VAT to HMRC, but you can subtract the \u00a32,000 that you paid yourself, so you make \u00a32,000 more profit.",
            "It looks like there's some confusion about the purchase price and reclaiming VAT. You should pay your supplier the total amount (\u00a310 + VAT in this scenario, so \u00a312) - look for this figure on the invoice or receipt. The supplier doesn't normally expect you to work this out for yourself, so I'd be a little surprised if it's not on there? As Dumbcoder's said, you'd then be able to claim the VAT back from HMRC if you were VAT registered. But seeing as you're not, then you don't need to worry about claiming it. And as for selling the product without VAT, you can (and probably should) increase the unit price to cover the extra cost, otherwise you'll be operating at a loss. Hope this helps!",
            "You only pay VAT if you buy from a VAT-registered company; if they are not registered, you don't pay. So, thinking about your supplier, if they are VAT-registered they will charge you VAT, if they are not they won't. The buyer's status makes no difference, the seller doesn't get involved in whether the buyer is able to reclaim or not (based on their VAT-registered status)."

        "question": "What's the difference between Market Cap and NAV?",
        "answer": "Market Capitalization (Market Cap) and Net Asset Value (NAV) are two different financial metrics used to evaluate companies and investment funds, respectively. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n\n1. **Market Capitalization (Market Cap):**\n   - It represents the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock.\n   - It is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of outstanding shares.\n   - Market cap reflects the market's perception of the total value of the company and can be influenced by investor sentiment.\n   - It gives an idea of the size of a company and how it compares to others in the market.\n\n2. **Net Asset Value (NAV):**\n   - It is commonly used in the context of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n   - NAV is the total value of the fund\u2019s assets minus its liabilities.\n   - It is often calculated at the end of each trading day and represents the per-share/unit price of the fund.\n   - NAV helps investors understand what the underlying assets of the fund are worth.\n\nIn summary, while Market Cap helps in determining the value of a publicly traded company as a whole, NAV is used to assess the value of individual shares or units of a mutual fund or ETF based on the assets and liabilities of the fund. Market Cap is influenced by market prices and investor behavior, whereas NAV is more directly tied to the actual value of a fund's underlying assets and liabilities.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"At any given moment, one can tally the numbers used for NAV. It's math, and little more. The Market Cap, which as you understand is a result of share value. Share value (stock price) is what the market will pay today for the shares. It's not only based on NAV today, but on future expectations. And expectations aren't the same for each of us. Which is why there are always sellers for the buyers of a stock, and vice-versa.  From your question, we agree that NAV can be measured, it's the result of adding up things that are all known. (For now, let's ignore things such as \"\"goodwill.\"\") Rarely is a stock price simply equal to the NAV divided by the number of shares. Often, it's quite higher. The simplest way to look at it is that the stock price not only reflects the NAV, but investors' expectations looking into the future.  If you look for two companies with identical NAV per share but quite different share prices, you'll see that the companies differ in that one might be a high growth company, the other, a solid one but with a market that's not in such a growth mode.\"",
            "NAV is  how much is the stuff of the company worth divided by the number of shares. This total is also called book value. The market cap is share price times number of shares. For Amazon  today people are willing to pay 290 a share for a company with a NAV of 22 a share. If of nav and price were equal the P/B (price to book ratio) would be 1, but for Amazon it is 13.  Why? Because investors believe Amazon is worth a lot more than a money losing company with a NAV of 22.",
            "\"I think the key concept here is future value.  The NAV is essentially a book-keeping exercise- you add up all the assets and remove all the liabilities.  For a public company this is spelled out in the balance sheet, and is generally listed at the bottom.  I pulled a recent one from Cisco Systems (because I used to work there and know the numbers  ;-) and you can see it here: roughly $56 billion... https://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=CSCO+Balance+Sheet&annual  Another way to think about it: In theory (and we know about this, right?) the NAV is what you would get if you liquidated the company instantaneously.  A definition I like to use for market cap is \"\"the current assets, plus the perceived present value of all future earnings for the company\"\"... so let's dissect that a little.  The term \"\"present value\"\" is really important, because a million dollars today is worth more than a million dollars next year.  A company expected to make a lot of money soon will be worth more (i.e. a higher market cap) than a company expected to make the same amount of money, but later.  The \"\"all future earnings\"\" part is exactly what it sounds like.  So again, following our cisco example, the current market cap is ~142 billion, which means that \"\"the market\"\" thinks they will earn about $85 billion over the life of the company (in present day dollars).\"",
            "\"Market caps is just the share price, multiplied by the number of shares. It doesn't represent any value (if people decide to pay more or less for the shares, the market cap goes up or down). It does represent what people think the company is worth.  NAV sounds very much like book value. It basically says \"\"how much cash would we end up with if we sold everything the company owns, paid back all the debt, and closed down the business? \"\" Since closing down the business is rarely a good idea, this underestimates the value of the business enormously. Take a hairdresser who owns nothing but a pair of scissors, but has a huge number of repeat customers, charges $200 for a haircut, and makes tons of money every year. The business has a huge value, but NAV = price of one pair of used scissors.\""

        "question": "How do you find an ethical, honest independent insurance broker in Canada?",
        "answer": "Finding an ethical and honest independent insurance broker in Canada involves doing due diligence and research to ensure that the broker you choose is reputable, has the necessary qualifications, and puts their clients' interests first. Here are some steps you can take to find a trustworthy broker:\n\n1. **Check Credentials:** Ensure that the broker is licensed to sell insurance in your province or territory. In Canada, every insurance broker must be licensed by the provincial or territorial insurance regulator.\n\n2. **Experience and Specialization:** Look for brokers with experience and those who specialize in the type of insurance you are seeking. Brokers with specific expertise are better equipped to understand your needs and offer tailored advice.\n\n3. **References and Reviews:** Ask for references from the broker and check online reviews or testimonials from other clients. Try to read through both positive and negative reviews to get a balanced picture.\n\n4. **Interview Potential Brokers:** Speak with potential brokers directly to get a sense of their professionalism and ethics. Ask about their approach to finding the best insurance options and how they manage conflicts of interest.\n\n5. **Ask for Disclosure:** An ethical broker should have no issue disclosing how they are compensated, including commissions or fees. Transparency about compensation is a good sign of an honest broker.\n\n6. **Look for Independence:** An independent broker does not work for a specific insurance company and can therefore offer a wider range of products from various insurers. This increases the chances of finding the best fit for your needs.\n\n7. **Professional Associations:** Many reputable brokers are members of professional associations like the Insurance Brokers Association of Canada (IBAC). Membership often requires adherence to a code of ethics and professional standards.\n\n8. **Avoid Pressure Tactics:** A good broker should not pressure you into making quick decisions or purchasing more coverage than you need. They should be patient and ensure you understand the products and your options.\n\n9. **Consult with Others:** Consider getting recommendations from friends, family, or colleagues who have had positive experiences with brokers in the past.\n\n10. **Ongoing Support:** Inquire about the broker's approach to ongoing client service. A reputable broker should provide consistent service and assist with claims or policy changes as needed.\n\nRemember that the process of selecting an insurance broker should be thorough, and you should feel comfortable with your choice. It's important to trust your instinct\u2014if something doesn't feel right, consider consulting with additional brokers before making your decision.",

        "question": "Why do some companies report how well their EBITDA performed even if their overall net profit did equally well?",
        "answer": "Companies report how well their EBITDA performed even if their overall net profit did equally well because EBITDA will always be higher than net income. This is principally because EBITDA does not include certain expenses that net income accounts for, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Therefore, reporting a higher EBITDA figure can make a company look better from a simplistic \"big number equals good\" perspective. It's a metric that is easy to report and is commonly understood, so companies might choose to highlight it to appear more favorable financially.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"EBITDA is in my opinion not a useful measure for an investor looking to buy shares on the stock market. It is more useful for private businesses open to changing their structuring, or looking to sell significant parts of their business. One of the main benefits of reporting Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization, is that it presents the company as it would look to a potential buyer. Consider that net income, as a metric, includes interest costs, taxes, and depreciation.  Interest costs are (to put it simply) a result of multiplying a business's debt by its interest rate. If you own a business, and personally guarantee the loan that the company has with the bank, your interest rates might be artificially low. If you have a policy of reaching high debt levels relative to your equity, in order to achieve high 'financial leveraging', your interest cost might be artificially high. Either way, if I bought your business, my debt structure could be completely different, and therefore your interest costs are not particularly relevant to me, a potential buyer. Instead, I should attempt to anticipate what my own interest costs would be, under my plans for your business. Taxes are a result of many factors, including the corporate structure of the business. If you run your business as a sole proprietorship (ie: no corporation), but I want to buy it under my corporation, then my tax rates could look nothing like yours. Or if we operated in multiple jurisdictions. etc. etc. Instead of using your taxes as an estimate for mine, I should anticipate my taxes based on my plans for your business. Depreciation / amortization is a measure that estimates how much of a business's \"\"fixed assets\"\" were \"\"used up\"\" during the year. ie: how much wear and tear occurred on your fleet of trucks? It is generally calculated as a % of your overall asset value. It is a (very loose) proxy for the cash costs which will ultimately be incurred to make repairs/replacements. D&A is also something which could significantly change if a business changes hands. If the value of your building is much higher now than when you bought it, I will have higher D&A costs than you [because I will be recording a % of total costs higher than yours], and therefore I should forecast my own D&A. Removing these costs from Net Income is not particularly relevant for a casual stock investor, because these costs will not change when you buy shares. Whatever IBM's interest cost is, reflects the debt structuring policy that the company currently has. Therefore when you buy a share in IBM, you should consider the impact that interest has on net income. Similarly for taxes and D&A - they reflect costs to the business that impact the company's ability to pay you a dividend, and therefore you should look at net income, which includes those costs. Why would a business with 'good net income' and 'good EBITDA' report EBITDA? Because EBITDA will always be higher than net income. Why say $10M net income, when you could say $50M EBITDA? The fact is, it's easy to report, and is generally well understood - so why not report it, when it also makes you look better, from a purely \"\"big number = good\"\" perspective? I'm not sure that reporting EBITDA implies any sort of manipulative reporting, but it would seem that Warren Buffet feels this is a risk.\""

There is uncertainty about whether current distribution channels for hemp will be effective for cannabis and if they will remain viable after cannabis is widely available. Additionally, the stigma associated with hemp due to its association with marijuana may change if cannabis becomes legal, which could consequently change company interest in distribution.

It's possible that the demand for hemp products will increase, but given that many Asian countries (Russia, China and Korea, for example) never banned it in the first place, there's a pretty ready supply already in place.

        "question": "W2 vs 1099 Employee status",
        "answer": "If you're a W2 employee, you cannot be legally changed to a 1099 contractor simply because your employer decides to pay you more. The change in compensation would not alter your employment status if your job responsibilities remain unchanged. Employers who try to switch an employee's status from W2 to 1099 without a legitimate change in the job role to that of an independent contractor could face legal consequences from both the employee and the IRS.\n\nAs a W2 employee, you are typically entitled to certain benefits, such as being paid for holidays and vacation time, whereas as a 1099 contractor, you would not. For example, if you worked 240 days a year as a W2 employee, you would be paid for 260 days to account for vacation and holidays. There are also other financial considerations such as covering your own insurance, the employer's share of Social Security taxes, and managing your retirement savings.\n\nThe decision between W2 and 1099 status should not be taken lightly, as it impacts not just your tax situation but also your entitlement to various benefits and protections as an employee. The IRS has a checklist to ensure that a 1099 contractor is classified correctly and not just as a means for an employer to shift costs onto the individual.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Careful.  I would personally need a LOT more than $5 more per hour to go from W-2 employment to 1099 employment.  It boils down to two reasons: (1) employers pay a huge amount of taxes on behalf of their employees, and (2) you would have to pay all of your own withholding up front. Your current proposal from them doesn't account for that. There are also risks that you face as a 1099.  On the first item, your employer currently pays 6.2% of your Social Security tax. You pay the other 6.2%. If you go to 1099 status, you will be self-employed as an independent contractor and have to pay the full 12.4% out of your increased 1099 wages.  On the second item, your employer also does your withholding out of your paychecks based on what you tell them on a form W-4. If you're disciplined enough to pay this out yourself in estimated taxes every time you get a paycheck, great. Many people aren't and just see a much bigger paycheck with no taxes out of it, and end up with a large tax bill at the end of the year.  Overall, there are some other considerations like healthcare and other benefits. These will not be available to you as a 1099 employee. You can also be terminated spontaneously, unless you have a specific contract length with the company.  As I see it, not including any benefits you would receive, you're looking at LESS money in your pocket at $50/hr as a contractor than at your $48/hr. Your pay net social security deductions is: $48 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = 99,840 * .938 = 93,649.92. As a 1099 @ $50/hr you would net $50 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = 104,000 * .876 = 91,104.  Then there are the rest of taxes, etc to figure out your real take-home pay.  I'm not a tax advisor, but I would be very careful to get the whole picture figured out before jumping. I would ask for a lot more with the added risk you would take as an independent, too.",
            "In general that's illegal. If you're a W2 employee, you don't miraculously become a 1099 contractor just because they pay you more. If your job doesn't change - then your status doesn't change just because they give you a raise. They can be sued (by you, and by the IRS) for that. Other issues have already been raised by other respondents, just wanted to point out this legal perspective.",
            "In general  What does this mean? Assume 10 holidays and 2 weeks of vacation. So you will report to the office for 240 days (48 weeks * 5 days a week).  If you are a w2 they will pay you for 260 days (52 weeks * 5 days a week). At $48 per hour you will be paid: 260*8*48 or $99,840. As a 1099 you will be paid 240*8*50 or 96,000. But you still have to cover insurance, the extra part of social security, and your retirement through an IRA. A rule of thumb I have seen with government contracting is that If the employee thinks that they make X,000 per year the company has to bill X/hour to pay for wages, benefits, overhead and profit. If the employee thinks they make x/hour the company has to bill at 2X/hour. When does a small spread make sense: The insurance is covered by another source, your spouse; or government/military retirement program.  Still $2 per hour won't cover the 6.2%  for social security. Let alone the other benefits. The IRS has a checklist to make sure that a 1099 is really a 1099, not just a way for the employer to shift the costs onto the individual.",
            "Another thing to consider, however, is the deductibility of business expenses.  Let's assume that the employer can legitimately hire you as a 1099 contractor.  (Would you be able to telecommute? Would you have a high degree of control over when you worked and when you didn't?  These factors also affect whether you're a true independent 1099 contractor or not.)  As a legit 1099 contractor, you're able to deduct certain business expenses directly from your income. (You can find a list of the rules at irs.gov.)  As a W2 employee, by contrast, can deduct only business expenses that exceed 2% of the your AGI (adjusted gross income).  So, you also have to consider your personal circumstances in making the calculus and comparing whether a legitimate 1099 contractor job is or is not good for you.  It's not just a comparison of what they'd pay W2 employees versus what they'd pay 1099 contractors."

Over time, this interest can accumulate to a significant amount, increasing the overall debt.\n\n3. **Minimum Payments**: Paying only the minimum amount each month prolongs the debt payoff timeframe and results in more interest paid over time.\n\n4. **Unexpected Expenses**: Medical emergencies, car repairs, or home maintenance can result in large, unplanned expenses that may need to be charged to a credit card.\n\n5. **Lack of Emergency Savings**: Without a financial buffer, people may resort to using credit cards for emergencies or during periods of unemployment.\n\n6. **Fees and Penalties**: Late payment fees, over-limit fees, and other penalties can add to the debt if not managed properly.\n\n7. **Poor Financial Management**: Without a budget or financial plan, it's easy to lose track of spending and debt levels.\n\n8. **Lack of Financial Education**: Not understanding how credit works or the implications of compounding interest can lead to poor credit card use.\n\n9. **Economic Factors**: Inflation, rising costs of living, or economic downturns can strain finances and push people towards credit card use to make ends meet.\n\n10. **Psychological Factors**: For some, there may be psychological drives such as retail therapy or the desire to maintain a certain lifestyle, despite not having the income to support it.\n\nIt's important to manage credit card use responsibly by keeping track of expenses, paying off balances in full when possible, and educating oneself about personal finance to prevent or reduce debt accumulation.",

            "\"I'm not sure if the rules in Canada and the US are the same. I'm as amazed as you are by the amounts of debts people have, but I can see how this credit can be extended. Generally, with good credit history and above average pay - it is not unheard of to get about $100K credit limit with a bunch of credit cards. What you do with that after that depends on your own ability to manage your finances and discipline. Good credit history is defined by paying your credit cards on time with at least minimum payment amount (which is way lower than the actual statement amount). Above average pay is $60K+. So you can easily have tons of debt, yet be considered \"\"low risk\"\" with good credit history. And that's the most lucrative market for the credit card issuers - people who do not default, but also have debt and pay interest.\"",
            "I would say you are typical.  The way people are able to build their available credit, then subsequently build their average balances is buy building their credit score.  According to FICO your credit score is made up as follows: Given that you had no history, and only new credit you are pretty much lacking in all areas.  What the typical person does, is get a card, pay on it for 6 months and assuming good history will either get an automatic bump; or, they can request a credit limit increase. Credit score has nothing to do with wealth or income.  So even if you had 100K in the bank you would likely still be facing the same issue.  The bank that holds the money might make an exception. It is very easy to see how a college student can build to 2000 or more.  They start out with a $200 balance to a department store and in about 6 months they get a real CC with a 500 balance and one to a second department store.  Given at least a decent payment history, that limit could easily increase above 2500 and there could be more then one card open.   Along the lines of what littleadv says, the companies even welcome some late payments.  The fees are more lucrative and they can bump the interest rate.  All is good as long as the payments are made. Getting students and children involved with credit cards is a goal of the industry.  They can obtain an emotional attachment that goes beyond good business reasoning.",
            "I had $70K in credit card at one point.  Limited income, starting a business - it's the only credit available. (yes, all paid off now).",
            "You must understand that not everyone has or can get credit cards. Consider that those who are in the the lowest 20-30% of income tend to have fewer credit cards (or none), and lower credit debt, although some have quite high credit card debt relative to their income.  So you really aren't comparing the same demographics (the population of all income earners, used to calculate average income, and the population of all credit card debt holders, are not the same groups of people). Once you remove those folks from consideration, then credit card usage may still average higher, but accept that it is unusual for people making less than $20K-30K/year to have much credit card debt. You must understand that wealth and income are two very different (although related) concepts. One must note that there are millions of people in the U.S. who have wealth; they have net assets of over $1M (excluding their homes). Many of those folks have assets greatly exceeding $1M. And although it might seem foolish to carry a large balance on their credit cards, they may have quite low interest rates, and simply find it simpler and more convenient to use credit cards in lieu of personal loans.  Suppose you have $2M in net assets, and want to buy a classic car or a diamond necklace.  Charging $30K and carrying the balance until a dividend check arrives may make sense. Understand also that not everyone makes the same choices, or good choices. Carrying a credit card balance may appear like a poor choice, especially when you are not wealthy, or have lower income. But suppose you have a high credit limit across several cards, and you need to handle a short-term financial challenge (car repair, layoff, medical bills, etc).  You might use the credit card to pay for that purchase, essentially financing an extraordinary event over a longer period of time.  And although having a balance of more than 5-10% of your monthly income may seem foolish to some, it may make sense to others. And some people choose to carry balances of 50% to 100% of their credit limit.  Others realize that keeping their credit utilization below 30%, 20%, or 10% of the credit limit is a better plan (both interest rate and risk wise).",
            "In the United States, when applying for credit cards, proof of income is on an honor system. You can make $15k a year and write on your application that you make $150k a year. They don't check that value other than to have their computer systems figure out risk and you get a yes or no. It was traditionally easy to attain credit, but that got tightened in 2008/2009 with the housing crisis. This is starting to change again and credit is flowing much more easily."

        "question": "splitting a joint mortgage - one owner in home",
        "answer": "When splitting a joint mortgage and one owner remains in the home, it's important to outline everything explicitly in a formal legal agreement, which should be done with the assistance of a lawyer. The agreement should define who is responsible for what costs, how income and expenses are managed, and how the property itself is divided\u2014into individual, shared portions, or otherwise. Each party should be responsible for their own costs as well as half of any shared costs, and should receive benefits corresponding to their portion.\n\nThe document outlines a method where the property's expenses and income (if any) are managed as a simple business, with all rent income being pooled into a separate account from which expenses like the mortgage and other housing costs are paid. Any profits after expenses would be split according to the ownership share. If one owner does work on the property, they should provide an estimate and scope of work as a contractor would, and be paid from the business income, considering that the cost of the work will affect the business's cash flow.\n\nA mechanism for one person to buy out the other or to sell their share should be set up, including how to handle offers and how the split occurs. It is advised to work towards a clean split with no joint property ownership to avoid complications and potential disputes in the future.\n\nThis suggestion is to safeguard both parties and ensure that expectations and responsibilities within this joint ownership are clear. If there is no agreement on these terms, especially an exit strategy, it could be a negative indicator regarding the feasibility of a fair and smooth splitting process. Consulting a financial professional is also recommended to ensure that all accounting and taxes are correctly managed.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Get a lawyer to put this in contract form, with everything spelled out explicitly. What is fair is what the two of you agree upon. My own suggestion: Divide the property into things which are yours, his, and shared, then have each of you be responsible for all your costs plus half the shared costs, but get all the benefits of your half. That would mean that if he rents out his half, all the rental income is his; if you decide to live in your half, all the savings of not paying rent are yours.  Each of you pays your half of mortgage, insurance, and other shared costs. Repairs to shared infrastructure should be done by someone both of you trust. If you agree the work is needed and he does it rather than your hiring someone, you owe him the appropriate percentage of the costs; the two of you will need to agree on whether you owe him for that percentage of his time as well. Make sure you agree on some mechanism for one person offering to buy the other out, or to sell their half to the other party... or potentially to someone else entirely. (Personally, I would try to do that at soonest opportunity, to avoid some of the ways this can go wrong -- see past comments about the hazards of guaranteeing a loan; this works or doesn't work similarly.) Does that address your question?",
            "Definitely get a lawyer to write up all the details of the partnership in a formal agreement. If your ex does not want to do this, that is a bad sign. You both need to be clear about expectations and responsibilities in this partnership, and define an exit strategy in the case one of you wants out. This is the most fair to both parties. Generally, what is common is that property is split cleanly when the relationship ends. I would strongly recommend you both work towards a clean split with no joint property ownership. How this looks depends on your unique situation. To address your questions 2 and 3: You have two roles here - tenant and owner.  As a 50% owner, you are running a business with a partner.  That business will have assets (home), income, expenses, and profit. You basically need to run this partnership as a simple business.  All the rent income (your rent and the other tenant's) should go into a separate account. The mortgage and all other housing expenses are then paid from only this account. Any excess is then profit that may be split 50/50. All expenses should be agreed upon by both of you, either by contract or by direct communication. You should see a financial professional to make sure accounting and taxes are set up properly. Under this system, your ex could do work on the house and be paid from the business income. However, they are responsible to you to provide an estimate and scope of work, just like any other contractor. If you as a joint owner agree to his price, he then could be paid out of the business income. This reduces the business cash flow for the year accordingly. You can probably see how this can get very complicated very fast. There is really no right or wrong answer on what both of you decide is fair and best. For the sake of simplicity and the least chance of a disaster, the usual and recommended action is to cleanly split all property. Good Luck!"

It really makes no difference if you are talking about EI, Auto, or Homeowner's insurance. My answer to that is no. What you are paying for when you buy insurance is financial risk avoidance. Look at it this way, you don't buy EI as an investment where you hope to get a return on your investment. You are buying the right to be protected against catastrophic financial difficulty associated with losing your job. Whether you claim it or not you did receive that protection. This is what drives me so crazy when I hear people talk about how an insurance company is ripping you off because you paid more in premiums than they paid out in benefits. Of course you did!

Like any insurance, it can't be affordable if it is bought only by those who think they will need it. The premiums you pay, in addition to giving you peace of mind, lower the premiums your neighbours pay. That contributes to social harmony. When your neighbours collect EI while looking for another job, they aren't tempted to turn to crime or legal-but-not-savoury ways to earn money. You probably like that, too. The fact they didn't get to choose whether or not to contribute means that they will be covered even if they aren't prudent and forward-looking people, which again is a benefit for you. And BTW, employers pay $1.40 in premiums for every dollar you pay. And we never collect. It's not for us. But we pay it.",

Perhaps that person who took the risk because of the ability to fail started the business that you now work for. Society works better (in my opinion) by keeping the bottom closer to the top.

However, for long-term investments, a significant allocation to bonds may not be necessary.\n\nAdditionally, the document advises taking advantage of tax benefits, such as those offered by IRAs and 401(k) plans, which often allow investments in ETFs.

This is different from a setup as an S-Corp, where employer contributions are deducted from wages and do not appear in Box 1 on your W-2, effectively reducing your gross income. Employee contributions are removed from Box 1 as well but still count for FICA/payroll tax purposes.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"This seems to depend on what kind of corporation you have set up. If you're set up as a sole proprietor, then the Solo 401k contributions, whether employee or employer, will be deducted from your gross income.  Thus they don't reduce it. If you're set up as an S-Corp, then the employer contributions, similar to large employer contributions, will be deducted from wages, and won't show up in Box 1 on your W-2, so they would reduce your gross income.  (Note, employee contributions also would go away from Box 1, but would still be in Box 3 and 5 for FICA/payroll tax purposes). This is nicely discussed in detail here. The IRS page that discusses this in more (harder to understand) detail is here. Separately, I think a discussion of \"\"Gross Income\"\" is merited, as it has a special definition for sole proprietorships. The IRS defines it in publication 501 as: Gross income.    Gross income is all income you receive in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt from tax. If you are married and live with your spouse in a community property state, half of any income defined by state law as community income may be considered yours. For a list of community property states, see Community property states under Married Filing Separately, later. Self-employed persons.    If you are self-employed in a business that provides services (where products are not a factor), your gross income from that business is the gross receipts. If you are self-employed in a business involving manufacturing, merchandising, or mining, your gross income from that business is the total sales minus the cost of goods sold. In either case, you must add any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources. So I think that regardless of 401(k) contributions, your gross income is your gross receipts (if you're a contractor, it's probably the total listed on your 1099(s)).\""

            "As a new (very!) small business, the IRS has lots of advice and information for you. Start at https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed and be sure you have several pots of coffee or other appropriate aid against somnolence.  By default a single-member LLC is 'disregarded' for tax purposes (at least for Federal, and generally states follow Federal although I don't know Mass. specifically), although it does have other effects. If you go this route you simply include the business income and expenses on Schedule C as part of your individual return on 1040, and the net SE income is included along with your other income (if any) in computing your tax. TurboTax or similar software should handle this for you, although you may need a premium version that costs a little more.  You can 'elect' to have the LLC taxed as a corporation by filing form 8832, see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc . In principle you are supposed to do this when the entity is 'formed', but in practice AIUI if you do it by the end of the year they won't care at all, and if you do it after the end of the year but before or with your first affected return you qualify for automatic 'relief'. However, deciding how to divide the business income/profits into 'reasonable pay' to yourself versus 'dividends' is more complicated, and filling out corporation tax returns in addition to your individual return (which is still required) is more work, in addition to the work and cost of filing and reporting the LLC itself to your state of choice. Unless/until you make something like $50k-100k a year this probably isn't worth it. 1099 Reporting. Stripe qualifies as a 'payment network' and under a recent law payment networks must annually report to IRS (and copy to you) on form 1099-K if your account exceeds certain thresholds; see https://support.stripe.com/questions/will-i-receive-a-1099-k-and-what-do-i-do-with-it  . Note you are still legally required to report and pay tax on your SE income even if you aren't covered by 1099-K (or other) reporting. Self-employment tax. As a self-employed person (if the LLC is disregarded) you have to pay 'SE' tax that is effectively equivalent to the 'FICA' taxes that would be paid by your employer and you as an employee combined. This is 12.4% for Social Security unless/until your total earned income exceeds a cap (for 2017 $127,200, adjusted yearly for inflation), and 2.9% for Medicare with no limit (plus 'Additional Medicare' tax if you exceed a higher threshold and it isn't 'repealed and replaced'). If the LLC elects corporation status it has to pay you reasonable wages for your services, and withhold+pay FICA on those wages like any other employer. Estimated payments. You are required to pay most of your individual income tax, and SE tax if applicable, during the year (generally 90% of your tax or your tax minus $1,000 whichever is less). Most wage-earners don't notice this because it happens automatically through payroll withholding, but as self-employed you are responsible for making sufficient and timely estimated payments, and will owe a penalty if you don't. However, since this is your first year you may have a 'safe harbor'; if you also have income from an employer (reported on W-2, with withholding) and that withholding is sufficent to pay last year's tax, then you are exempt from the 'underpayment' penalty for this year.  If you elect corporation status then the corporation (which is really just you) must always make timely payments of withheld amounts, according to one of several different schedules that may apply depending on the amounts; I believe it also must make estimated payments for its own liability, if any, but I'm not familiar with that part."

This implies that the business should have charged VAT at the time of sale rather than attempting to collect it months later. As UK and EU law require prices to be displayed including relevant taxes, and considering that it is not common practice even in the US for businesses to claim sales tax from a customer after the original sale, it appears that there is no legal standing for the company to demand the VAT from you now. In fact, it seems the business should accept their mistake and handle the tax payment themselves. \n\nIt is suggested that you could either ignore the request for the additional payment or respond, informing them that they should have included the VAT in the original pricing and that you are not willing to pay any extra charges now.",

As you say, UK and EU law require that prices are displayed including relevant taxes. Since this business is in the US, they might be able to claim that those rules don't apply to them. But I'm not aware of even US businesses being able to claim sales tax from a US customer months after originally making a sale, and it goes against all reasonable principles of law if they would be able to do it. So the business should really just accept that they screwed up and they'll now have to take the hit and pay the tax themselves. They can work as if the pre-tax price was $12.99/1.2 = $10.825, leaving $2.165 they need to hand over to HMRC. I don't think there's any legal way they can demand money from you now, and certainly for such a low sum of money there's no practical way they could. I can't find anything definitive one way or the other, but I suppose it's possible that HMRC would consider you the importer under these circumstances and so liable for the VAT yourself. But I don't know of any practial way to actually report this to HMRC or pay them the money, and again given the amount there's no realistic chance they'd want to chase you for it. In your shoes I would either ignore the email, or write back and politely tell them that they should have advertised the cost at the time and you're not willing to pay extra now. And you might want to keep an eye on the card you used to pay them to make sure they don't try to just charge it anyway. EDIT: as pointed out in a comment, the company behind this (or at least one with a very similar problem and wording in their emails!) did end up acknowledging that they can't actually do this and that they'll need to pay the tax out of the money they already collected, as I described above. It seems they didn't contact the people they originally emailed to let them know this, though. There's some more discussion here.",
            "Note: I am not a lawyer. This is my personal opinion and interpretation. First, your source is European Law, which obviously doesn't apply outside of the EU. The EU cannot make laws that bind entities in other countries; so you cannot claim that the VAT was needed to be mentioned. Second, if you owe something, you owe it; it doesn't matter if it was forgotten to be mentioned. At best, you can say that under those circumstances you don't want the software anymore, and i would assume you can send it back and get your money back (minus a fee for having it used for a while...) - this gets quite difficult to calculate clearly, so it's probably not a good avenue to follow for you. As the company has to send the VAT to your country (they will not be allowed to keep a dime of it, and have to bear the complete cost for the handling), it is a debt you have to your government; they are just the entity responsible for collecting it. Still, if you just ignore them, they will probably suck it up, and your government will also not do a thing to you. If they only have your email address, they have no way of knowing if you even still have/use this address; for all they know, it could be you never got it. They also cannot simply charge your card, as they probably don't have the card data any more (they are not supposed to keep it after the transaction is complete, and they thought it was complete at the time). All in all, you should be safe to ignore it. It's between you and your god/consciousness, if you feel obliged to pay it, as technically you owe it."

This ownership structure means that credit unions prioritize what is best for their members rather than outside shareholders.\n   \n2. Cooperative Nature: A credit union is essentially a cooperative, similar to a union, but instead of bargaining for labor-related benefits, members of a credit union lend each other money. This historical model has shaped their operations, leading them to offer services to members of the union, usually within a targeted niche or geographic area. By becoming a member, you own a stake in the union, making you eligible for these services.\n\n3. Profit Structure: Just like banks, credit unions generate profit by lending out capital at higher interest rates than they offer for savings. Despite having the same fundamental business model as banks, credit unions often return profits to members in the form of better interest rates and lower fees since members are the owners.\n\nIn summary, credit unions and local community banks can offer a more personalized banking experience with potentially better terms for loans and savings, as they operate with a membership-driven model that focuses on benefits for their members.",

I offer this anecdote to share a 'deduction' story - The first year I did my MIL's taxes, I had to explain that she didn't   have enough deductions to itemize. Every year since, she hands me a   file full of paper substantiating medical deductions that don't exceed   7.5% of her income. In turn, I give her two folders back, one with the 5 or so documents I needed, and the rest labeled \"\"trash\"\". Fewer than 30% of filers itemize. And a good portion of those that do, have no question that's the right thing to do. e.g. my property tax is more than the $12K, so anything else I have that's a deduction adds right to the number.  It's really just those people who are at the edge that are likely frustrated. I wrote an article regarding Standard Deduction vs Itemizing, in which I describe a method of pulling in one's deductible expenses into Odd years, reducing the number in Even years, to allow a bi-annual itemization. If this is your situation, you'll find the concept interesting.  You also ask about filing status. Think on this for a minute. After pulling in our W2s (TurboTax imports the data right from ADP), I do the same for our stock info. The stock info, and all Schedule A deductions aren't assigned a name. So any effort to split them in search of savings by using Married Filing Separate, would first require splitting these up. TurboTax has a 'what-if' worksheet for this function, but when the 'marriage penalty' was lifted years ago, the change in status had no value. Items that phaseout over certain income levels are often lost to the separate filer anyway. When I got married, I found my real estate losses each year could not be taken, they accumulated until I either sold, or until our income dropped when the Mrs retired.  So, while is respect your desire for these magic dials within the software, I think it's fair to say they would provide little value to most people.

        "answer": "The decision to be self-employed as an independent contractor or consultant versus being a permanent employee comes with a variety of risks and rewards that must be considered carefully:\n\n**Risks of being Self-Employed Independent Contractor/Consultant:**\n\n1. **Taxes and Social Security**: Unlike permanent employees, self-employed individuals are responsible for paying both the employee and employer share of Social Security taxes. This is because self-employed individuals must file a Schedule SE with their tax return, covering both their income tax and self-employment taxes .\n\n2. **Lack of Benefits**: Independent contractors typically do not have access to employer-provided benefits such as healthcare, and there's a lack of security with the potential for spontaneous termination unless a specific contract length is agreed upon with the company .\n\n3. **Additional Costs and Responsibilities**: Without the support of an employer, independent contractors need to cover their own insurance, retirement savings through an IRA, and additional parts of social security. They also bear the burden of managing and paying estimated taxes periodically rather than having taxes withheld by an employer .\n\n**Rewards of being Self-Employed Independent Contractor/Consultant:**\n\n1. **Potential for Higher Earnings**: Assuming that one can command a sufficiently higher hourly rate to cover the additional costs and risks, there is the potential to net more income as a contractor than as a salaried employee, particularly if the contractor\u2019s skills are in high demand .\n\n2. **Business Expense Deductions**: Self-employed individuals may be able to deduct certain business expenses directly from their income, thereby reducing taxable income and potentially saving money on taxes .\n\n3. **Greater Flexibility and Autonomy**: Independent contractors might experience more flexibility in terms of remote work possibilities, setting their own schedules, and choosing which projects to work on, provided they meet the criteria of a true independent contractor .\n\nIn comparison, **being a permanent employee typically offers**:\n\n- More stable income,\n- Employer-provided benefits (e.g., health insurance, retirement contributions),\n- Less personal liability for social security contributions (as they are shared with the employer),\n- Fewer tax-related responsibilities since taxes are withheld by the employer.\n\nCareful consideration of these factors is important in making an informed decision about which work arrangement is best suited to an individual's circumstances and personal preferences.

        "answer": "The proliferation of small banks in the United States can be linked to the history of banking regulations that encouraged local banking, as well as economic events that led to shifts in the banking sector.\n\nHistorically, branch banking, especially interstate branch banking, was viewed unfavorably by U.S. regulators, which led to the enactment of the McFadden Act of 1927. This Act specifically prohibited interstate banking. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 further prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state. These restrictions were meant to promote the idea of localness, where local bankers would potentially have a better understanding of local communities and economies than distant ones who only see numbers and paperwork .\n\nAdditionally, the collapse of many Savings and Loan Associations (S&Ls) in the 1980s also played a role. The S&Ls were once a significant part of the financial industry, but after they were allowed to engage in consumer and commercial loans, checking accounts, among other banking services, many of these institutions failed due to a lack of experience in managing these new activities and due to instances of fraud. Following the disappearance of most S&Ls, many small banks, often with State charters only, sprung up to take their place in the market .\n\nFurthermore, mortgage lending, being a lucrative business when done correctly, has attracted a high number of banks into the sector, contributing to the high number of banking institutions in the U.S. .\n\nThe restrictions on interstate banking began to ease with the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which repealed most interstate prohibitions. However, by that time, many small, local banks had been established throughout the country, a trend which somewhat continues even after large banks have consolidated and expanded their reach .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"As an addendum to PeterK's answer, once upon a time, there were many Savings and Loan Associations (S&Ls) that acted as small banks, accepting savings deposits from people and lending money for home mortgages to local residents. Some of these S&Ls were chartered Federally with deposits insured by the FSLIC (similar to the FDIC which still insures deposits in banks) while others had State charters and used the State equivalent of FSLIC as the insurer. To induce people to save with S&Ls instead of banks, S&Ls paid higher rates of interest on their savings accounts than banks were permitted to do on bank savings accounts. Until 1980, S&Ls were not permitted to make consumer or commercial loans, have checking accounts, issue credit cards, etc., but once the US Congress in its wisdom permitted this practice, this part of the business boomed. (Note for @RonJohn: Prior to 1980, S&Ls offered NOW accounts on which \"\"checks\"\" (technically, Negotiated Orders of Withdrawal) could be written but they were not checks in the legal sense, and many S&Ls did not return these paid \"\"checks\"\" with the monthly statement as all banks did; writing a \"\"check\"\" while pressing hard created a carbon copy that could be used as proof of payment). In just a few years' time, many S&Ls crashed because they were not geared to handle the complexities of the new things that they were permitted to do, and so ran into trouble with bad loans as well as outright fraud by S&L management and boards of directors etc. After the disappearance of most S&Ls, many small banks (often with State charters only) sprang up, and that's why there are so many banks in the US. Mortgage lending is a lucrative business (if done right), and everyone wants to get into the business. Note that 4 branches of Bank of America in a Florida town is not a sign of many banks; the many different banks that the OP noticed in Maine is.\"",
            "Wikipedia has a good summary: Historically, branch banking in the United States - especially interstate branch banking - was viewed unfavorably by regulatory authorities, and this was codified with the enactment of the McFadden Act of 1927, which specifically prohibited interstate banking. Over the next few decades, some banks attempted to circumvent McFadden's provisions by establishing bank holding companies that operated so-called independent banks in multiple states. To address this, The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state. Most interstate banking prohibitions were repealed by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. Research has also found that anticompetitive state provisions restricted out-of-state growth when those provisions were more restrictive than the provisions set by the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act or by neighboring states. Some states have also had restrictive bank branch laws; for example, Illinois outlawed branches (other than the main office) until 1967, and did not allow an unlimited number until 1993.",

One further reason not mentioned before could be that the population density in Canada outside of the metropolitan areas could be lower than in the US, leaving to few small towns large enough (10,000+ (a guess corrected due to comment)) to support a bank.",
            "In the US, paper checks are still the rule, and there is a large amount of the population that does not care to use online banking. As a result, those people need to go to the bank once a week or more often, to deposit checks they get from anywhere, to get cash, etc.; so all those little banks have traffic. This is slowly changing, and banks start to automatic the processes even in the brick-and-mortar location, but for now, they are around.",
            "\"First, is population density. You didn't say where exactly, but for example here in Tampa, Wells Fargo has 25 branches in the area  (though that is a bit larger then what I would think of the Tampa area as a local) Second, we can mix in service expectation. I expect that in addition to \"\"good\"\" online service, \"\"great\"\" phone service, \"\"great\"\" email service, that when I have a problem, don't understand something, or want to talk about my options for investing or choosing account types, that I am able to go into a branch. That I can \"\"walk in\"\" and see someone quickly, or schedule an appointment and see some one right away (at my appointment time).  Together, these two options means that on a busy day, the nearest Wells Fargo Branch to me has at any one time, 50 - 60 people in it. Smaller branches, of course have less, and larger branches exist. So it just takes that many branches to address the number of people and their expected needs.  As to why there are so many different brands/banks Well that's just the USA. We believe in capitalism. We have believed in it much stronger in the past, but banks are the central to capitalism so why shouldn't they serve as an example.  At it's core (a very simplistic look) Capitalism and a free market means that we as customers are better served by having lots of different brands fighting for our business. It should drive more consumer desired features  (like lower prices, higher interest rates, better fee schedules, etc.) while forcing those brands to operate \"\"better\"\". (Just ignore the bail out, that's a loaded topic) So for some of us, we want a big bank like Wells Fargo, because we want the rates, structure, and service they can provide as a \"\"big bank\"\". For others they want the more personal touch of a \"\"small bank\"\". There are benefits both ways.  For example there may be a bank that only allows people with excellent credit to open accounts. That allows they to have lower over all mortgage rates, but means their checking accounts have higher minimums. While the next bank may be more inclusive, and have smaller minimum balances, but as a result charge more for loans.  We like our options, and rest assured all those \"\"brands\"\" offer products that have differences that attract customers.\""

        "question": "What's an economic explanation for why greeting cards are so expensive?",
        "answer": "Greeting cards are expensive for a variety of economic and market-based reasons. One factor is convenience; it's much simpler for a consumer to buy a card than to take the time to create one, despite the materials and printing costs being relatively low for individual production . Also, the retail markup on cards is significant, often near 100%, which contributes to their high prices in stores .\n\nMoreover, the lack of competition keeps prices high. Large companies like Hallmark dominate the market, and the cost to a new entrant, both in creating a product and then establishing retail presence, is prohibitive . This results in established companies being able to set their prices without severe competition pressure. For instance, a designer of card designs may earn a significant annual income without entering the business independently, giving larger companies an advantage with their extensive distribution networks .\n\nMarketing also plays an essential role. Consumers may feel obligated to purchase a \"real\" greeting card from well-known brands to avoid appearing cheap, especially for significant occasions. Companies like Hallmark invest considerably in marketing to maintain this perception and justify the high margins on their products . Despite the existence of cheaper alternatives, such as those provided by companies using a \"pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap\" strategy, these have not significantly affected the overall pricing within the greetings card market .\n\nAdditionally, greeting cards are not purchased frequently, and the amounts paid\u2014even if considered high for a piece of paper\u2014are relatively small compared to other expenses. As a result, consumers are less sensitive to the cost, particularly when the card is part of a gift. On the production side, the continuous creation of new and unique cards involves writers, graphic designers, and other staff, which means a significant amount of human labor is invested for each card sold. These costs, along with retail, marketing, and distribution expenses, contribute to the final sale price .\n\nThe overall economics of the greeting card industry thus include high retail markups, barriers to entry for competition, marketing strategies that play on consumer emotions, and the non-frequent nature of card purchases, all of which lead to greeting cards maintaining their relatively high prices  .",

            "Competition, or actually lack of competition, mostly due to a demand curve that has minimal change due to price. You would buy the equivalent, cheaper option if it was available, but the store has little interest in offering multiple, competing options that would drive their same store revenue down. And the competing stores (Grocery, Department, Drug, Card) have similar overhead costs (floor space, lights, personnel). Most carry the cards for incremental revenue, and observe little advantage to lower price for a card (customers seldom buy more cards due to a lower price). Thus they mark the price to what (most) customers are willing to pay. You may choose to shop the various stores and find the one that has a (slightly) better pricing for cards, and then stop at that store when you want to buy a card. But many cards are sold as an incremental purchase as part of a larger shopping trip (convenience), as the customer combines trips (reduce the time spent shopping, albeit not reducing the money spent).",

While you could easily find some pictures and lay them out with a sentiment, buy some card stock, print in colour, trim it, and perhaps glue on some glitter or whatnot, and then find an envelope that fits it, it's likely to take you an hour or more to do so. And you'll invest far more than $6 on your printer and various inventories. I made cards for my kids- we had construction paper, glitter, coloured markers etc and there was no need for an envelope. But most people will find it quicker and simpler to buy one fully assembled. The cost of the online ones is weird I agree. Perhaps people are also not confident they can compose a good greeting? Why do stores stock $6 cards that they buy for $3 (retail markup is 50-100% and I'm sure it's closer to 100% for cards) when a different supplier might provide them for $2? Well, even if such a supplier existed, I'm sure the store would be happy to sell for $6 still (see: people buy them) so there would be no consumer impact. A store that sells cards for $5 isn't going to siphon customers from elsewhere because most of us just don't buy cards often enough for it to matter.  Why does nobody become that supplier who will sell them cheaper? Selling stuff is more expensive than making stuff, and getting your product into retail stores is hard. Hard means time and time means money and all of that contributes more to the card price than the ink and paper do. That said, dollar stores sell cards, for a dollar typically, and people do buy them. I find they have less colours and the artwork is cruder. Perhaps you even get what you pay for when it comes to design, layout, printing etc.",
            "I actually have a bit of experience with the supplier side of this. Having worked with other people attempting to get the business launched, I can shed a bit of insight. The primary reason for the pricing is that there simply isn't enough competition to warrant dropping the price any lower than it already is. Large companies such as Hallmark will typically buy card designs at 5% of the card's selling price. With their existing distribution network, this makes bringing in new and varied designs much easier for large companies that are already well established. Having talked with such designers in the past, someone working full time producing designs makes on average 30-60k annually from this, which is worth it to someone who doesn't want to jump through the hoops of actually getting into the business independently. The primary issue stifling competition is actually getting your product into stores. There are topics here that I cannot discuss due to NDA, but I can break down the overall outline for you: You need to start with a large number of designs, with enough variety that companies think could sell well. If you bring a handful of designs with you, no company is going to take your business venture seriously enough. You need to find a company that can stamp out a large production process for you. The company is going to need to be nice enough to take smaller purchase orders on the magnitude of several hundred cards, but also be capable of scaling that production to several hundreds of thousands of cards very quickly. For cards specifically, most companies want you to ship custom racks with your cards. Some companies may provide their own racks for stocking your product, but not all of them will. This will also cost a lot of money up front. You need to find a buyer for a company you want to sell your product to. This is important, and what killed our original business plans. Think Wal-Mart, Target, or even CVS Pharmacy. These big companies are going to have people who's entire job is to buy new products to put on their shelves. This is where networking is key, you need to find people with connections to these buyers if you're not already well established with them. You will also likely fail several times, either getting outright ignored, or through a broker that can't meet expectations. For example, we had a broker that introduced us to a buyer for a large store chain, and after several months of work we found out that this broker was just pulling our strings. Typically a company will want to test your product in a handful of stores to see if it will sell. For example, Target may want to test your product in 100-200 stores over 3 months and expect your product to sell at a minimum rate. Finally, you need to be able to scale your production. Suddenly you'll be asked to go from supplying 100 stores to supplying 1,800 stores with a deadline in 2 weeks. Buyers will even turn you down at this point if they don't think you can meet the production. All of this work takes at least a year, and typically takes several years to go from an initial product to having your product in every store. Without breaking the numbers down too much, we could make a profit of ~$1.60 for every $3 card that sold. That number doesn't cover the cost of racks and other overhead, that's just the per-card profit. Even then, people are more likely to go view the Hallmark or other big-name cards over your offering. Only when another company becomes a big powerhouse to be competitive will these companies be forced to drop their prices.",
            "\"We generally speak of the \"\"elasticity of demand\"\". Greeting cards are expensive because they can be. We buy them in a sentimentally weakened state, and we do not buy them by the tonne. There is also the concept of \"\"Market Segmentation\"\", but not so much. Essentially the price is determined by finding the \"\"point of pain\"\" and winding it back a little. So people will pay $5 for a card.  They will not (generally) pay $5,000 unless there is a good reason (vanity ?). Why sell them for $2 ? The customers who baulk at $5 tend not to even have $2. (Market segmentation again).  In short the price is always going to need to be set before the point where demand rolls off sharply, to maximise profit.\"",
            "\"It'll all about the marketing. If you don't get a \"\"real\"\" greeting card for that important birthday or anniversary or whatever, the recipient may thing you're being cheap for using a card you printed out yourself. So you pay $6 for a card because you feel like you have to. Hallmark advertises with those sappy TV commercials for a very good reason. The margins on the product are sky-high, and they spend a good chunk of that money on marketing the product. Perfume is the same way: super cheap to make, low barrier to entry, and the popular ones command a high price.\"",
            "(At least in the UK) a company named Card Factory has been very successful in undercutting the competition using the classic pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap strategy with less glamorous high-street locations than 'traditional' stores. Interestingly it doesn't seem to have spawned either competition at their price point or lowered the general prices for greetings cards even in low-margin businesses like supermarkets. A quick glance at their annual report suggests they're doing reasonably well with this approach.",
            "As one answer points out, people buying greeting cards care little about whether they cost 25 cents or $5.  Those are both small amounts of money and it's not something you buy often---also people feel the need to spend money because it's a gift. On the supplier side, it should be noted that the cost of cards has little to do with the paper they are printed on.  There is an expectation that cards are new and unique...something the buyer and recipient have never seen.  So they have writers and graphic designers constantly cranking out a large variety of cards and replacing existing cards with new ones, of which only a small number get sold before they move to the next model.  Relatively speaking, there is a lot of human effort per thousand cards sold.  Then of course there is the real estate they occupy in the store (disproportionate to a bunch of pieces of paper) and other retail, marketing, and distribution costs.  I'm not saying margins are particularly thin, but if they were crazy high we probably would see more entry as you suggest.",
            "It cost a lot of money to pay the poet to make wording, designers/photographers to make the post-cards and miscellaneous staff (Executives, HR, shareholders etc.) These cost are thrown onto the buyers."

        "question": "How does a bank make money on an interest free secured loan?",
        "answer": "The search results do not explicitly answer the question of how a bank makes money on an interest-free secured loan. However, the concept of an interest-free loan often involves other fees or opportunities for the bank to make money. While not specified in the document, in practice, an interest-free secured loan might cost the bank money upfront in lending the capital, but they often make up for it through various fees, such as origination fees, service charges, or late payment fees. Additionally, by offering such loans, banks may be able to attract new customers who will later use other paid services or products offered by the bank, thereby generating income indirectly. Since the information provided in the results does not contain the specifics about making money from interest-free secured loans, it would be beneficial to review banking practices outside the document or consult a finance professional for detailed mechanisms.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"A \"\"true\"\" 0% loan is a losing proposition for the bank, that's true.  However when you look at actual \"\"0%\"\" loans they usually have some catches: There might also be late payment fees, prepayment penalties, and other clauses that make it a good deal on average to the bank.  Individual borrowers might be able to get away with \"\"free money\"\", but the bank does not look to make money on each loan, they look to make money on thousands of loans overall. For a retailer (including new car sellers). the actual financing costs will be baked into the sales price.  They will add, say, 10% to the sales price in exchange for an interest-free loan. They can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity, but they would be sold at a deep discount, so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other \"\"fees\"\". It's possible that they would just chalk it up to promotional discounts or customer acquisition costs, but it would not be a good practice on a large scale.\"",
            "Most 0% interest loans have quite high interest rates that are deferred. If you are late on a payment you are hit with all the deferred interest. They're banking on a percentage of customers missing a payment.  Also, this is popular in furniture/car sales because it's a way to get people to buy who otherwise wouldn't, they made money on the item sale, so the loan doesn't have to earn them money (even though some will). Traditional banks/lenders do make money from interest and rely on that, they would have to rely on fees if interest were not permitted.",
            "Generally speaking, an interest-free loan will be tied to a specific purchase, and the lender will be paid something by the vendor. The only other likely scenario is an introductory offer to try to win longer-term more profitable business, such as an initial interest-free period on a credit card. Banks couldn't make money if all their loans were interest-free, unless they were getting paid by the vendors of whatever was being purchased with the money that was lent.",
            "The bank depends on the laws of large numbers.  They don't need to make money on every customer -- just on average. There are several ways that zero interest makes sense to them: You asked about banks, and I don't think you see this last scheme in use very much by a bank.  Here's why.   First, customers absolutely hate it - and when you drop the interest bomb, they will warn their friends away, blow you up on social media, call the TV news consumer protectors, and never, ever, ever do business with you again.  Which defeats your efforts in customer acquisition.  Second, it only works on that narrow range of people who default just a little bit, i.e. who have an auto-pay malfunction.  If someone really defaults, not only will they not pay the punishment interest, they won't pay the principal either!  This only makes sense for secured loans like furniture or cars, where you can repo that stuff - with unsecured loans, you don't really have any power to force them to pay, short of burning their credit.  You can sue them, but you can't get blood from a stone.",
            "If interest rates are negative, a 0% load might still be profitable.",
            "\"Other answers didn't seem to cover it, but most \"\"0%\"\" bank loans (often offered to credit card holders in the form of balance transfer checks), aside from less-obvious fees like already-mentioned late fees, also charge an actual loan fee, typically 2-3% (or a minimum floor amount) - that was the deal with every single transfer 0% offer I ever saw from a bank. So, effectively, even if you pay off the loan perfectly, on time, and within 0% period, you STILL got a 3% loan and not 0% (assuming 0% period lasts 12 months which is often the case).\"",
            "Car dealers as well as boat dealers, RV dealers, maybe farm vehicle dealers and other asset types make deals with banks and finance companies to they can make loans to buyers. They may be paying the interest to the finance companies so they can offer a 0% loan to the retail customer for all or part of the loan term.  Neither the finance company nor the dealer wants to make such loans to people who are likely to default. Such customers will not be offered this kind of financing. But remember too that these loans are secured by the asset - the car - which is also insured. But the dealer or the finance company holds that asset as collateral that they can seize to repay the loan. So the finance company gets paid off and the dealer keeps the profit he made selling the car. So these loans are designed to ensure the dealer nor the finance company looses much. These are called asset finance loans because there is always an asset (the car) to use as collateral.",
            "\"In addition to all the points made in other answers, in some jurisdictions (including the UK where I live) the consumer credit laws require the lender to allow the borrower to pay off the loan at any time. If the lender charges interest and the borrower pays off the loan early then the lender loses the interest that would have been paid during the rest of the loan period. However if the actual interest is baked into the sale price of an item and the loan to pay for it is nominally \"\"0%\"\" then the borrower still pays all the interest even if they pay off the loan immediately. If you think this game is being played then you can ask for a \"\"cash discount\"\" (or similar wording: I once had problems with a car salesman who thought I meant a suitcase full of used \u00a320s), meaning you want to avoid paying the interest as you are not taking a loan.\"",
            "Very good answers as to how 0% loans are typically done.  In addition, many are either tied to a specific large item purchase, or credit cards with a no interest period.  On credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer, who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee.  In the case of a large purchase item like a car, the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest, something they are willing to do to make the sale.  They will typically be less prone to deal as low a price in negotiation if you were not making that deal, or at times they may offer either a rebate or special low to zero finance rates, but you don't get both."

Scammers can easily disappear after receiving upfront payments.\n\n3. **Lack of Information and Reviews**: Research the company well. Look for online reviews, Better Business Bureau (BBB) ratings and reviews, and the length of time the company has been in business. If there is little to no information available about the company, it's a red flag.\n\n4. **Unrealistic Promises**: Promises of creditors suddenly willing to give up a substantial percentage of the money you owe for no clear reason are suspicious. It's uncommon for creditors to reduce debts without a robust justification.\n\n5. **Personal Information Safety**: Be wary of offers that require you to provide extensive personal information, which could put you at risk of identity theft.\n\n6. **Professional Advice**: Consulting with a finance or legal professional can provide you with guidance tailored to your specific situation and can help you avoid scams.\n\nBy being skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true, avoiding upfront payments without a written agreement, thoroughly researching the consolidation company, and seeking professional advice when in doubt, you can better protect yourself from falling victim to a scam .",

            "\"I believe no-one who's in a legal line of business would tell you to default voluntarily on your obligations. Once you get an offer that's too good to be true, and for which you have to do something that is either illegal or very damaging to you - it is probably a scam. Also, if someone requires you to send any money without a prior written agreement - its probably a scam as well, especially in such a delicate matter as finances. Your friend now should also be worried about identity theft as he voluntary gave tons of personal information to these people.

If they said they'd pay off the debt and issue the new loan - fine, let them do it and then you pay them. If they insist on having money upfront without delivering anything - unless it's a very big and known and established company you probably better off not doing it.

        "answer": "Determining \"excess cash\" for enterprise value (EV) calculations from a balance sheet is subjective and varies by company and industry . However, here is a general approach you can consider:\n\n1. **Identify Cash Components**: Start by identifying all the cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. This includes items such as cash in hand, demand deposits with banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\n\n2. **Consider Current Liabilities**: Examine the company\u2019s current liabilities to understand the amount of cash needed to cover short-term obligations. This could include accounts payable, short-term debt, and other similar obligations.\n\n3. **Assess Long-Term Investments**: Look at the company\u2019s long-term investments, which might include illiquid assets like real estate. Only consider liquid long-term investments toward excess cash and exclude illiquid ones.\n\n4. **Calculate Excess Cash**: One suggested calculation for excess cash is: \n   `Excess Cash = Current Assets - Current Liabilities + Cash & Equivalents`, \n   which takes into account the net working capital plus the cash and cash equivalents .\n\n5. **Consider the Business Needs**: Understand the business's operational needs for cash, as some might require high amounts of working capital, for example, if they are increasing inventories to fund growth. Such operational cash might not be considered \"excess\" as it is essential for running the business profitably .\n\n6. **Averaging Over Periods**: Since a balance sheet is just a snapshot of a particular day, it's important to average several periods to account for any seasonal effects and to get a more accurate picture of the company's usual cash level .\n\n7. **Benchmark Against Revenue**: After calculating the excess cash for a few companies, compare it to the revenue to see if it's close to a certain percentage. While there is no hard rule, a rough guideline mentioned is 2% of revenues as a reserve for excess cash, although this will vary significantly based on the industry .\n\nRemember that this process involves a degree of interpretation and estimation, and industry norms, as well as the particular circumstances of the company, should be taken into account. Adjustments might also be made based on how conservative the analysis is meant to be. Using excess cash in the computation of EV is considered conservative because by deducting excess cash, you increase EV and thereby potentially make the EV/EBITDA multiple seem higher, signaling a more expensive stock .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bYou're not missing anything. Excess cash is somewhat of a nebulous concept. To different people it means different things. The answer is that excess cash varies for each company depending on their business. For instance, some companies need very high amounts of working capital. A company may be increasing their inventories and therefore will require more cash on their balance sheet to fund growth. If a company always needs this extra cash, some investors prefer to leave that cash out of a valuation because the company cannot run profitably without it. Think about what happens to your calculation of Enterprise Value if you subtract excess cash as opposed to cash. Excess cash is always less than cash. Therefore by subtracting excess cash you increase EV. Since one common valuation metric is EV/EBITDA, a higher numerator will make the stock seem more expensive - that is the EV/EBITDA ratio will seem higher when using excess cash as opposed to cash. So using excess cash in your valuation methodology is basically a conservative concept. Depending on the business 20% of revenues seem way too high as a reserve for excess cash. 2% is a much better rule of thumb.",
            "20% is almost certainly too high. I agree with 2%, as a very rough rule. It will vary significantly depending on the industry. I generally calculate an average of the previous 2-3 years working capital, and deduct that from cash. Working capital is Current Assets less Current Liabilities. Current Assets is comprised of cash, prepaid expenses, and significantly, accounts receivable. This means that CA is likely to be much higher than just cash, which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted. Which reduces EV, which makes the EV/EBITDA ratio look even more pricey, as Dimitri noted. But a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter. As such, and because of seasonal effects, it's critical to smooth this by averaging several periods. After calculating this for a few companies, compare to revenue. Is it close to 2%?",
            "\"Excess Cash = Cash & Equivalents + Long-Term Investments - Current Liabilities The problem this calculation of excess cash is that \"\"long-term investments\"\" can be illiquid things like real estate. Another flaw is that it gives no credit for Current Assets, like receivables, which can be used to offset Current Liabilities. The first thing I'd do is \"\"net out\"\" Current Assets and Current Liabilities, then add Cash back in.  Excess Cash = Current Assets - Current Liabilities + Cash & Equivalents. It would be nice if GAAP would require Long-Term Investments to be broken out as a) liquid long-term investments (stocks, bonds) b) illiquid long-term investments (real estate, private equity, etc)\""

        "question": "Why can't you just have someone invest for you and split the profits (and losses) with him?",
        "answer": "One of the common arrangements for allowing someone to invest on your behalf and share in the profits and losses is through what is called a managed account or by investing in a partnership structure like a hedge fund. In both cases, there are professionals who are responsible for making investment decisions, and the gains (and potentially losses) are shared among the investors. These structures usually have an agreed-upon fee or profit-sharing arrangement.\n\nHere are a few reasons why individuals and institutions choose this route and some considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Expertise**: Professional investors typically have the expertise and resources to analyze investment opportunities, react quickly to market changes, and execute sophisticated strategies.\n\n2. **Time-saving**: For individuals who do not have the time to manage their investments actively, delegating this task to professionals can be advantageous.\n\n3. **Access to investments**: Some funds or managed accounts give investors access to a wider range of securities, including those that may be less accessible to individual investors due to high minimum investment requirements or complexity.\n\n4. **Diversification**: Professional managers can create a diversified portfolio that potentially reduces risk.\n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks:\n\n1. **Fees**: Managed accounts and funds often charge management fees and, sometimes, performance fees, which can eat into the profits. It's essential to understand the fee structure before entering such an arrangement.\n\n2. **Risk of losses**: As with any investment, there is a risk of loss. Engaging a professional does not guarantee profits, and you will typically share any losses incurred on the investments.\n\n3. **Control**: By having someone else manage your investments, you give up some control over your money. This lack of control may not be suitable for all investors.\n\n4. **Alignment of interests**: There can sometimes be a misalignment of interests between the manager and the investor. For example, a manager may take higher risks in the pursuit of profits because it is not their money on the line.\n\n5. **Liquidity and lock-up periods**: Some investment arrangements, such as hedge funds, may have lock-up periods during which you cannot withdraw your funds.\n\nIt's crucial to perform due diligence on the manager, understand the investment strategy, be clear about the terms and conditions of the investment, and ensure that it fits your risk tolerance and investment goals. Legal agreements often govern these relationships to define the terms of the profit and loss sharing, responsibilities, and limitations. It's advisable to consult with a financial adviser or legal professional before engaging in such an investment arrangement.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The 2 and 20 rule is a premium arrangement that hedge funds offer and venture capital funds offer, and they also offer different variations of it. The 2 is the management fee as percent of assets under management, the 20 is the profit cut, which they only get if they are profitable. There are 0/20, 1/15, and many variations. You're assuming that nobody offers this arrangement because it isn't offered to you, but that's because nobody offers it to people that aren't wealthy enough to legally qualify for their fund. When you park 6 or 7 figure amounts in bank accounts, they'll send your information out to the funds that operate the way you wish they operated.",
            "This means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit, I will keep half of those profits, but if I lose you money, I will cover half those losses. The bold part is where you lose me. This absolutely exists with the exception of the loss insurance.  It just requires a lot more than the general retail consumer investor has to contribute.  Nobody wants to take on the responsibility of your money then split 50% of the gross proceeds of your $10,000 (or whatever nominal amount of money you're dealing with) investment and return it all to you after a year.  And NO money manager will insure that the market won't decline. Hedge funds, PE Firms, VC Firms, Investment Partnerships, etc all basically run the way you're describing (again without your loss insurance).  Everyone's money is pooled and investments are made.  Everyone shares the spoils and everyone shares the losses.  And to top it off, the people making investment decisions have their money invested in the fund.  All of them have to pay rent and accountants and other costs associated with running the fund and that will eat in to the proceeds to some degree; because returns are calculated on net proceeds. With enough money you can buy yourself in to a hedge fund, for the rest of us there are ETFs and other extremely fee-reasonable investment options.  And if you don't think the performance and preservation of assets under management is not an incentive to treat the money with care you're kidding yourself (your first bullet point). I'll add that aside from skewing the manager's risk tolerance toward guaranteed returns I doubt you would fair favorably over the long term compared to simply paying even an egregious 1% expense ratio on an ETF.  If you look at the S&P performance for 10 or 20 or however many years, I'd venture that a couple good years of giving up half of your gains would have you screaming for your money back.  The bad years would put the money manager out of business and the good years would squander your gains.",
            "\"You are conflating two different types of risk here.  First, you want to invest money, and presumably you're not looking at the \"\"lowest risk, lowest returns\"\" end of the spectrum. This is an inherently risky activity.  Second, you are in a principal-agent relationship with your advisor, and are exposed to the risk of your advisor not maximizing your profits. A lot has been written on principal-agent theory, and while incentive schemes exist, there is no optimal solution.  In your case, you hope that your agent will start maximizing your profits if they are 100% correlated with his profits. While this idea is true (at least according to standard economic theory, you could find exceptions in behavioral economics and in reality), it also forces the agent to participate in the first risk.  From the point of view of the agent, this does not make sense. He is looking to render services and receive income for it. An agent with integrity is certainly prepared to carry the risk of his own incompetence, just like Apple is prepared to replace your iPhone should it not start one day. But the agent is not prepared to carry additional risks such as the market risk, and should not be compelled to do so. It is your risk, a risk you personally take by deciding to play the investment gamble, and you cannot transfer it to somebody else.  Of course, what makes the situation here more difficult than the iPhone example is that market-driven losses cannot be easily distinguished from incompetent-agent losses. So, there is no setup in which you carry the market risk only and your agent carries the incompetence risk only. But as much as you want a solution in which the agent carries all risk, you probably won't find an agent willing to sign such a contract. So you have to simply accept that both the market risk and the incompetence risk are inherent to being an investor.  You can try to mitigate your own incompetence by having an advisor invest for you, but then you have to accept the risk of his incompetence. There is no way to depress the total incompetence risk to zero.\"",
            "\"Why is nobody providing a service that is basically: Give me your money. I will invest it as I see fit. A year later I will return the capital to you, plus half of any profits or losses. This means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit, I will keep half of those profits, but if I lose you money, I will cover half those losses. Because they can already make lots of money by just charging people an unconditional fee and not having to cover their losses.  Why take on the risk of having to cover your losses when they can just take a percentage of your assets and stick you with any losses? In addition, as Charles E. Grant mentioned in a comment on another answer, if a person has both sufficient capital to cover your losses and sufficient confidence in their investing acumen that they don't think they will have to do so, they have little need for your money.  Rather than take half the gains on your money, they will invest their own money (they must have some, or else they can't guarantee your losses) and take all the gains. Your scheme would only be plausible as a partnership between a person with investing skills but little capital, and another person with ample capital and less skill.  In that case, the investment whiz could genuinely benefit from access to the bankroller's capital.  As quid noted in chat, this does exist in the form of ad-hoc private equity arrangements between individuals.  However, such a setup is unlikely to exist as an \"\"off-the-shelf product\"\" marketed at retail investors, because financial institutions have more capital than any individual retail investor -- and, more generally, anyone with sufficient skill to pull this off will (at least in theory) quickly accumulate enough capital that they can negotiate a less risky payment plan.\"",
            "The issue is the time frame. With a one year investment horizon the only way for a fund manager to be confident that they are not going to lose their shirt is to invest your money in ultra conservative low volatility investments. Otherwise a year like 2008 in the US stock market would break them. Note if you are willing to expand your payback time period to multiple years then you are essentially looking at an annuity and it's market loss rider. Of course those contacts are always structured such that the insurance company is extremely confident that they will be able to make more in the market than they are promising to pay back (multiple decade time horizons).",
            "\"For one thing fund managers, even fund management companies, own less money than their clients put together. On the whole they simply cannot underwrite 50% of the potential losses of the funds they manage, and an offer to do so would be completely unsecured. Warren Buffet owns about 1/3 of Berkshire Hathaway, so I suppose maybe he could do it if he wanted to, and I won't guess why he prefers his own business model (investing in the fund he manages, or used to manage) over the one you propose for him (keeping his money in something so secure he could use it to cover arbitrary losses on B-H). Buffett and his investors have always felt that he has sufficient incentive to see B-H do well, and it's not clear that your scheme would provide him any useful further incentive. You say that the details are immaterial. Supposing instead of 50% it was 0.0001%, one part in a million. Then it would be completely plausible for a fund manager to offer this: \"\"invest 50 million, lose it all, and I'll buy dinner to apologise\"\". But would you be as attracted to it as you would be to 50%? Then the details are material. Actually a fund manager could do it by taking your money, putting 50% into the fund and 50% into a cash account. If you make money on the fund, you only make half as much as if you'd been fully invested, so half your profit has been \"\"taken\"\" when you get back the fund value + cash. If you lose money on the fund, pay you back 50% of your losses using the cash. Worst case scenario[*], the fund is completely wiped out but you still get back 50% of your initial investment. The combined fund+cash investment vehicle has covered exactly half your losses and it subtracts exactly half your profit. The manager has offered the terms you asked for (-50% leverage) but still doesn't have skin the game. Your proposed terms do not provide the incentive you expect. Why don't fund managers offer this? Because with a few exceptions 50% is an absurd amount for an investment fund to keep in cash, and nobody would buy it. If you want to use cash for that level of inverse leverage you call the bank, open an account, and keep the interest for yourself. You don't expect your managed fund to do it. Furthermore, supposing the manager did invest 100% of your subscription in the fund and cover the risk with their own capital, that means the only place they actually make any profit is the return on a risk that they take with their capital on the fund's wins/losses. You've given them no incentive to invest your money as well as their own: they might as well just put their capital in the fund and let you keep your money. They're better off without you since there's less paperwork, and they can invest whatever they like instead of carefully matching whatever money you send them. If you think they can make better picks than you, and you want them to do so on your behalf, then you need to pay them for the privilege. Riding their coattails for free is not a service they have any reason to offer you. It turns out that you cannot force someone to expose themselves to a particular risk other than by agreeing that they will expose themselves to that risk and then closely monitoring their investment portfolio. Otherwise they can find ways to insure/hedge the risk they're required to take on. If it's on their books but cancelled by something else then they aren't really exposed. So to provide incentive what we normally want is what Buffett does, which is for the fund manager to be invested in the fund to keep them keen, and to draw a salary in return for letting you in[**]. Their investment cannot precisely match yours because the fund manager's capital doesn't precisely match your capital. It doesn't cover your losses because it's in the same fund, so if your money vanishes the fund manager loses too and has nothing to cover you with. But it does provide the incentive. [*] All right, I admit it, worst case scenario there's a total banking collapse, end of civilization as we know it, and the cash account defaults. But then even in your proposed scheme it's possible that whatever assets the fund manager was using as security could fail to materialise. [**] So why, you might ask, do individual fund managers get bonuses in return for meeting fixed targets instead of only being part-paid in shares in their own fund whose value they can then maximise? I honestly don't know, but I suspect \"\"lots of reasons\"\". Probably the psychology of rewarding them for performance in a way that compares with other executive posts or professions they might take up instead of fund management. Probably the benefit to the fund itself, which wants to attract more clients, of beating certain benchmarks. Probably other things including, frankly, human error in setting their compensation packages.\"",

This Consumer Reports article is balanced These have a reputation for being bad for the consumer compared to buying term life and investing in a mutual fund separately, but if you want the guarantee (or are a \"\"moral hazard\"\" for a life insurance policy, closer to death than you appear on paper) it may be a product for you.

If I had more risk tolerance I would be pretty happy to have half the value of my \"\"fund\"\" as zero cost investment capital for more aggressive investments.  My business would then be a lot like an insurance company without the hassle of selling insurance to get hold of float to invest.  Also, most insurance companies actually lose money on policies, but come out ahead by investing the float, so an insurance company with zero cost float is quite a good business. Another answer mentions Berkshire Hathaway.  If you read one of the famous Berkshire Hathaway annual letters to shareholders and read the section about insurance you'll see that very low cost float has a large role in that company's success. So, back to your end of the deal: if the deal is that good for me, how good is it for you?  I'd have to double market returns just for you to break even.

If you wanted an investment where your losses were only half as bad, but your gains were only half as good, then you could just invest half your assets in a risk-free investment. So if you want this hypothetical instrument because you want a different risk profile, you don't actually need anything new to get it. And what does the fund manager get out of this arrangement? She doesn't get anything you don't: she just gets half your gains, most of which she needs to set aside to be able to pay half your losses. The discrepancy between the gains and losses she gets to keep, which is exactly equal to your gain or loss. She could just invest her own money to get the same thing. But wait -- the fund manager didn't need to provide any capital. She got to play with your money (for free!) and keep half the profits. Not a bad deal, for her, perhaps... Here's the problem: No one cares about your thousands of dollars. The costs of dealing with you: accounting for your share, talking to you on the phone, legal expenses when you get angry, the paperwork when you need to make a withdrawal for some dental work, mailing statements and so on will exceed the returns that could be earned with your thousands of dollars. And then the SEC would probably get involved with all kinds of regulations so you, with your humble means and limited experience, isn't constantly getting screwed over by the big fund. Complying with the SEC is going to cost the fund manager something. The fund manager would have to charge a small \"\"administrative fee\"\" to make it worthwhile.  And that's called a mutual fund. But if you have millions of free capital willing to give out, people take notice. Is there an instrument where a bunch of people give a manager capital for free, and then the investors and the manager share in the gains and losses? Yes, hedge funds! And this is why only the rich and powerful can participate in them: only they have enough capital to make this arrangement beneficial for the fund manager.\"",
            "At this point the cost of borrowing money is very low.  For the sake of argument, say it is 1% per year for a large institution. I can either go out and find a client to invest 100,000$ and split profit and loss with them. Or, I could borrow 50,000$, pay 500$/year in interest, and get the same return and loss, while moving the market half as much (which would let me double my position!) In both cases the company is responsible for covering all fixed costs, like paying for traders, trades, office space, branding, management, regulatory compliance, etc. For your system to work, the cost to gather clients and interact with them has to be significantly less than 1% of the capital they provide you per year. At the 50% level, that might actually be worth it for the company in question.  Except at the 50% level you'd have really horrible returns even when the market went up.  So suppose a more reasonable level is the client keeps 75% of the returns (which compares to existing companies which offer larger investors an 80% cut on profits, but no coverage on losses). Now the cost to gather and interact with clients has to be lower than 2500$ per million dollars provided to beat out a simple loan arrangement.  A single sales employee with 100% overhead (office, all marketing, support, benefits) earning 40,000$/year has to bring in 32 million dollar-years worth of investment every year to break even. Cash is cheap.  Investment houses sell cash management, and charge for it.  They don't sell shared investment risk (at least not to retail investors), because it would take a lot of cash for it to be worth their bother. More explicitly, for this to be viable, they'd basically have to constantly arrange large hedges against the market going down to cover any losses.  That is the kind of thing that some margin loans may require.  That would all by itself lower their profits significantly, and they would be exposed to counter-party risk on top of that.

However the fact that the trader is able to prove that they have a consistent enough trading history to be trusted with the large accounts generally means that losses are rare (one would hope!).

            "\"Written with some mild snark , but no insult intended, because financial stuff can be ridiculously confusing... Looked at another way, you're basically asking if the Biblical \"\"Parable of the Talents\"\" can be implemented as a business model.  You as the investor wish to be the \"\"master\"\", with the entity doing the investing playing the part of the \"\"servant\"\". Since the law prohibits actual servitude as described in scripture, the model must substitute a contractual profit- and loss-sharing scheme. OK, based on what you've proposed, and by way of example, let's say you invested a thousand dollars. You give the investment service your money. At the end of a year, they give you back   - Your capital ($1000)  - Plus 1/2 of any profits  OR  - Less 1/2 of any losses So let's say the worst happens and they lose ALL of it. According to your proposal, they have to cover 1/2 of the loss. You end up with $500...but they end up with LESS than nothing. They will be in a deficit situation because all the expense was theirs. They don't just fail to make a profit. They go in the hole. It doesn't matter what percentages you use. Regardless of how the loss is shared, you've only guaranteed YOU can't lose all your money. The company CAN. Given a large enough investment, or enough market fluctuation, a big shared loss could shut down a smaller firm. To summarize:   - You want a service that charges you nothing   - Does all the work of expertly managing and investing your capital  - Takes on part of the risk you would normally bear  - (on top of their usual risk and liability)  - Agrees to do so solely for a percentage of any return (where higher returns will likely involve a higher degree of risk)  - AND that guarantees, after just 1 year, you'll get X% of your capital back, no matter what. Win or lose.  - Even if the market crashes and all your capital, and theirs, is wiped out Superbest, um, to be serious briefly: what you're proposing is, if nothing else, inherently unfair and inequitable. I believe you intended it as a mutually beneficial scenario, but the real-world imbalance in risk and reward prevents it being so. Any financial service that would accept those terms along with the extra degree of risk would be fiscally irresponsible. From a business standpoint it's an untenable model, and no company would build on it. It would be tantamount to corporate suicide. The requirement that a service promise to give you back X% of your money, no matter how great the loss, makes your proposal impossible. You need to think about how much all this costs, realistically, as well what kind of returns you can actually expect. And that more risk for higher return is exactly what a service could NOT take a chance on if it had to \"\"share\"\" investors' losses. Besides, it's not really sharing, now is it? They will always lose more than you, always end up in a negative situation, unable even to recoup costs. Circumstances beyond their control could result in a drop in the value that not only wipes out any profit, but requires them to pay YOU for work performed and expenses incurred on your behalf.  Why would they let anyon double-dip like that? Yeah, we all prefer getting something for nothing...but you want valuable services and for them to pay you money for the privilege of providing them? I totally agree that would be fantastic, but in this world even \"\"free\"\" doesn't come cheap anymore. And getting back to costs:  Without consistent income the service would have nowhere to work and no resources to work with. No office, computer, phone, electricity, Internet, insurance, payroll, licensing, training, maintenance, security, lobbying, etc., etc., etc. Why do people always forget overhead? There's a reason these services operate the way they do. Even the best are working with fairly slim margins in a volatile sector. They're not into 1-year gambles unlikely to cover their cost of doing business, or having to pay for a negative return out of their own pocket. Look, if you're the Biblical master asking your servant to manage things, overhead is built-in. You're taking all the risk as well. You're paying for all three servants' food, home, clothing, etc, plus you had to buy the servants themselves. So its reasonable that you reap the reward of their labor. You paid for it, and you didn't even punish the servant who buried your money in a hole. The two good servants may have done the legwork, but you took on the burden of everything else. In your proposed service, however, contrary to the servant's usual role, the servant - i.e., the company - would be assuming a portion of your risk on top of their own, yet without any guarantee of profit, income, or even coverage of costs. They're also subject to regulations, fees, liability, legal stuff, etc. that you're not, against most of which you are indemnified and held harmless. If they agree to cover a share of your loss, it exposes to greater liability and more related risk. It robs them of resources they need to  invest in their own business, while at the same time forcing them to do all the work. As a result, your model doesn't give such a service a fighting chance. Getting it off the ground and lasting past the first-year payouts would require more luck than skill.  They'd be better off heading to Vegas and the blackjack table, where the only overhead is a cheap flight and room, where the odds and rules don't change overnight, and they at least get free drinks. If none of the equivalents satisfies, then the Biblical parable appears to describe your only option for obtaining exactly what you want: Move to a country where slavery is legal and buy an investor  :-) Cheers, c\"",

The gain is that half your losses are covered. The cost is that half your profits are lost. For that to be a net benefit to you, you would have to expect that you will gain more from this than you will lose from it. That is, you must expect that the investment has negative value. But if you expect that the investment has negative value, why are you investing? This also doesn't really align incentives between the two parties. The person choosing the investment is not incurring opportunity cost (because they have no funds locked up) while you are. So they have an incentive to be conservative that you do not. For example, say I could make 1% in an ultra low risk CD. The person choosing the investments has an incentive to put me in something that he only expects to make around 0.5% (because he gets to keep half the profits and it costs him nothing).

        "answer": "Gas stations charge different amounts in the same local area for a number of reasons:\n\n1. **Brand**: Major brands charge more because their gasoline often includes proprietary detergents and maintains more stringent quality controls. In contrast, discount brands may be at the upper limit of allowable ethanol content and may not adhere to the same quality standards.\n\n2. **Market Price**: Gas stations react quickly to market price changes, which can cause immediate increases in pump prices. However, when market prices fall, stations decrease their prices more slowly to manage losses and recoup costs.\n\n3. **Overhead**: The operating costs such as location (e.g., next to highways), property value, and station maintenance can lead to higher charges at the pump.\n\n4. **Taxation**: Local and federal taxes on gasoline affect prices; areas with higher taxes will generally have costlier gas.\n\n5. **Proximity to Competitors**: Stations adjust their prices based on competition in the immediate vicinity, often within a cent of each other to attract customers.\n\n6. **Population Distribution**: In areas with higher populations, stations may not need to be as competitive with pricing due to a larger customer base, whereas rural or less populated areas might see more competitive pricing between stations.\n\n7. **Zone Pricing**: Stations may participate in zone pricing, where fuel prices are adjusted based on factors like traffic volume, local household income, amenities, strength of competitors, etc. This can lead to significant price differences even among stations a few miles apart.\n\n8. **Supply Chain Factors**: The costs for delivery and brand affiliations can also influence the final price at the pump.\n\nThese factors combined result in the varying gas prices seen within local areas, and stations are legally allowed to set prices to manage profitability and costs effectively .",

            "\"This is known as \"\"Zone Pricing\"\" or \"\"Geographical Pricing\"\". http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/19/business/fi-calprice19 Such price variations may seem odd, but they are not unique to Anaheim. On any given day, in any major U.S. city, a single brand of gasoline will sell for a wide range of prices even when the cost to make and deliver the fuel is the same. The primary culprit is zone pricing, a secret and pervasive oil company strategy to boost profits by charging dealers different amounts for fuel based on traffic volume, station amenities, nearby household incomes, the strength of competitors and other factors. It's a controversial strategy, but the courts have thus far deemed it legal, and the Federal Trade Commission recently said the effect on consumers was ambiguous because some customers got hurt by higher prices while others benefited from lower ones. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pricing Zone pricing, as practiced in the gasoline industry in the United States, is the pricing of gasoline based on a complex and secret weighting of factors, such as the number of competing stations, number of vehicles, average traffic flow, population density, and geographic characteristics. This can result in two branded gas stations only a few miles apart selling gasoline at a price differential of as much as $0.50 per gallon. But the short answer is \"\"because they can\"\". It's legal, provided that some people are paying less while others are paying more. Essentially the larger, richer audience is subsidizing the product for other areas. It's not terribly different than the way most drugs are priced in the world.\"",
            "Location, Location, Location. The closer to the highway, the more they can charge. People want to go less than a mile from the exit to get gas. Therefore  they save time, but spend more money. That is understandable, so the gas station takes advantage of the situation.",
            "There are many factors.   Most gas stations price their gas based on what it will cost them to replace it.  So when their supplier raises the price that it charges the station the station typically raises its prices proportionality.  The suppliers tend to have their own rates.  The business needs to make a profit so the business sets the price where it feels it will make the most money. Some stations buy bargain gas.  Many people say they find this gas to be just fine.  Personally some stations gas seems to make my cars run much worse.  I can say that my mileage can vary by as much as 4 miles to the gallon based on where I get my gas.  So I pay more to go to those stations that consistently have provided me good gasoline.  However higher prices do not necessarily mean better gas.  We have a BP just down the street that seems to have bad gas while one about a half a mile away that I prefer because I have never had a bad tank of gas.  Both are priced about the same. Also some localities have special tax zones.  These are local taxes levied based on the location.  We have 4 different zones here in Peoria IL (150k pop).  That does not take into account the smaller cities around us.",
            "I only have anecdotal evidence here as members of my family used to own a grocery store / gas station, but they were often time charged much more to have the gasoline delivered to than many gas stations which were just a mile or two away (up to 15% more).  Also depending upon the branding of the gas station, they are required to use certain distributors (i.e. if you are an Exxon gas station you can only use a few select vendors) which gave them less control of their final cost.  All in all the gasoline often had smaller margins than items in the grocery store, which are already extremely low.",
            "When I ran a gas station, our price was largely set by our neighbors-- the other gas stations in the area. We couldn't go below the current cost of replacement gas, but other than that we wanted to be at .05 over the average. (We got away with charging more because we were the last station on a major road.) Everybody else did the same thing. Also, we only set prices once a day, early in the morning before the commuter rush. Changing prices while somebody is pumping gas Was Not Done, for fairly obvious reasons. So, you'd get these ripples of price-changing, as one station changed its price, and then all its neighbors would react to that the next day, and then THEIR neighbors would change the day after that, and so on.",
            "One factor I haven't seen mentioned is volume.  Suppliers will charge a slightly lower price to the station if they buy in full tanker truck loads instead of smaller quantities.  Where I am this is probably still the largest factor in price spread with all newer bigger stations being 20-30 cents cheaper than the old small ones (often a repair shop with 2 pumps out front); the only reason it's slowly becoming less pronounced is that the old small stations are steadily closing up as their tanks fail leak inspections because they don't sell enough gas to justify repair and replacement.",
            "Some of this is demand management.  The local BJ's wholesale club sells gas $0.10-0.15/gallon less than the prevailing rate. Typically there are lines of 3-5 cars waiting for a pump during busy periods. People are price-conscious when buying gas, which draws crowds and the retailer actually wants a line -- the whole point of the gas station is to draw traffic to the warehouse club. Other gas stations have the opposite problem -- big crowds lead to fewer people buying food and drinks in the convenience store, which is where the business actually makes its money. They want a steady stream of people. In my area, there is a gas station that is on a busy intersection right off the highway ramp going to the airport. Their problem is that people returning rental cars used to swarm the gas station and cause traffic tie-ups on the road -- a problem averted by marking up the gas $0.30.",
            "\"I'll echo: many factors. Brand: There are generally two levels of pricing: \"\"major brand\"\" and \"\"discount brand\"\". You can generally expect the \"\"discount brand\"\" to cost about 5-10 cents less per gallon in the same neighborhood as \"\"major brand\"\" gas. This is for a number of sub-factors; chief among them is that not all gasolines are created equal. A lot of the major brands (Shell, Texaco, Chevron, BP, Exxon) have proprietary detergents and cleaning agents that the discount brands do not. They're also generally closer to the real octane rating of the gas, have less ethanol (you'll see the sign that says \"\"contains up to 10% ethanol\"\"; the bargain brands are right up at that limit while the top-tier brands keep it lower) and have stricter requirements about storage tank maintenance. Anyone who tells you that all gas is the same, send em my way; I tried to save a few bux buying the cheaper stuff and now my car needs an engine overhaul because of fouling causing premature wear. A couple of my co-workers got a fuel system overhaul free from the local supermarket because the storage tank wasn't properly purged, and they got water into their gas tanks. Market Price: Yes, this is of course a factor. Generally, gas prices at the pump rise very quickly when the market price of crude or gasoline goes up, then fall more slowly than the market price, because the margins on gas sales for a C-store are very slim. When prices change, the C-stores lose either way; when prices rise they have to pay more than they got from the last tankful to buy the next one, and when prices fall they don't recoup the cost of their current tank. By quickly increasing the price to match commodities market prices, then gradually lowering them over time even if the market collapses, they mitigate the losses both ways. Overhead: A gas station right next to a highway probably had to pay more for that land, both to buy/lease it and in property taxes. Nicer (newer, cleaner) stations generally have to pay more to stay that way. The higher your operating costs, the more you'll have to charge for your gas. You can usually do so because the nicer station will attract customers willing to pay a few cents more for the nicer facilities. Taxation: Most States charge a tax on gasoline, in addition to a Federal tax on gas. That revenue either goes into the State's general fund, or is earmarked for transportation costs like road maintenance. California's gas prices are sky-high across the state, because they have the highest gas tax. I'm not sure Colorado, Wyoming and Montana have gas taxes at all. Proximity to other stations: No matter what you have to pay for the land and facilities, if there's another station across the street, you have to be within a penny of their price or people will vote with their feet. While \"\"predatory pricing\"\" (taking a loss on sales in one area, buffered by profits elsewhere, in order to drive out competition) is technically illegal, you see it all the time in the C-store industry and it is very difficult to prove. This is a primary cause of neighborhood-to-neighborhood changes; a C-store will look around the other stations on their street corner, and the ones down the road a block or two each direction, when determining what they can sell gas for that day. The guy five blocks down has a completely different pool of competing stations. Population Distribution: With a lot of people in a particular area, there's a big \"\"pie\"\" of customer dollars for C-stores to compete for. This generally leads to increased prices because the stations don't have to be AS cutthroat; regardless of how good your price is, you have only so many pumps, and at some point people will pay more to use the open pump than wait for the cheaper one. The reverse is true in rural areas; with only two stations in an entire small town, those two stations will become extremely cutthroat. However, rural prices also vary more; with only one station in easy walking distance from where you ran out of gas, they can charge you $6 to fill that gallon gas can if they want, and you'll pay it because the next gas station's another 20 miles down the road and probably has even higher prices. This, along with overhead, is generally why the Rockies states have the lowest average prices; land's cheap and people are scarce in Wyoming. But, the \"\"price-gouging\"\" can be seen in the rural Southwest, where there's a LOT of ground to cover between gas stations, and so the \"\"last chance gas\"\" along major highways just outside of town, each a nickel to a dime more than the previous station, is a common stereotype. Transportation costs: Prices are higher on the East and West Coasts than in the Gulf States for a very simple reason; the bulk of the U.S. refinery capacity is along the Gulf Coast between Galveston and the Florida border. The further you are from there, the more it costs to get the fuel from the refinery to the gas station, and that cost is reflected at the pump. In fact, the East Coast imports gasoline by tanker even though the United States is now a net exporter of gasoline, because it's cheaper to buy it from foreign sources than it would be to watch it drip through the limited pipeline capacity that exists between the Gulf states and the Eastern Seaboard.\""

        "question": "Should I Purchase Health Insurance Through My S-Corp",
        "answer": "Whether you should purchase health insurance through your S-Corp depends on various factors, including the state laws where your S-Corp operates. According to IRS Notice 2008-1, in some states, a corporation cannot purchase group health insurance if the corporation only has one employee. If the shareholder is the sole employee, they must purchase health insurance in their name. The notice outlines that a shareholder can potentially claim an above-the-line deduction if the health insurance is purchased in their name but the S corporation either directly pays for it or reimburses the shareholder for it, and the premium payment is included in the shareholder\u2019s W-2 as taxable compensation.\n\nTo take advantage of this deduction, however, your S-Corp must be allowed to purchase group health insurance per your state's regulations, and the health insurance premiums must ultimately be paid by the S corporation and reported as taxable compensation on your W-2. If your state does not permit your S-Corp to purchase a group health plan because you are the only employee, then you might be able to get the deduction if you took the steps mentioned above .\n\nAdditionally, if you are a salaried employee of your S-Corp, you can have your employer (the S-Corp) cover you by a group plan, and you would pay your portion as part of a pre-tax salary deduction, which is deductible. The employer's portion is also a legitimate business expense. However, this option must be available to all employees, not just owner-employees .\n\nGiven the complexity of the tax implications and the variability of state laws, it would be wise to seek advice from a CPA or other tax advisor who is familiar with your specific circumstances and state regulations. They can provide tailored advice on whether you should purchase health insurance through your S-Corp and how to do so in a tax-efficient manner.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The answer seems to depend on where you live.  Perhaps you already found this, but the summary from the IRS is: The insurance laws in some states do not allow a corporation to purchase group health insurance when the corporation only has one employee. Therefore, if the shareholder was the sole corporate employee, the shareholder had to purchase his health insurance in his own name. The IRS issued Notice 2008-1, which ruled that under certain situations the shareholder would be allowed an above-the-line deduction even if the health insurance policy was purchased in the name of the shareholder. Notice 2008-1 provided four examples, including three examples in which the shareholder purchased the health insurance and one in which the S corporation purchased the health insurance. Notice 2008-1 states that if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name and paid for it with his own funds, the shareholder would not be allowed an above-the-line deduction. On the other hand, if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name but the S corporation either directly paid for the health insurance or reimbursed the shareholder for the health insurance and also included the premium payment in the shareholder\u2019s W-2, the shareholder would be allowed an above-the-line deduction. The bottom line is that in order for a shareholder to claim an above-the-line deduction, the health insurance premiums must ultimately be paid by the S corporation and must be reported as taxable compensation in the shareholder\u2019s W-2. https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/S-Corporation-Compensation-and-Medical-Insurance-Issues I understand this to mean that you can only get the deduction in your case (having purchased it in your own name) if your state does not allow your S-Corp to purchase a group health plan because you only have one employee. (I don't know specifically if Illinois fits that description or not.)  In addition, there are rules about reporting health insurance premiums for taxes for S-Corp share members that you should also check.  Personally, I think that it's complicated enough that advice from a CPA or other tax advisor specific to your situation would be worth the cost.",
            "I'm not sure about reimbursement, you'll have to talk to a tax adviser (CPA/EA licensed in your State). From what I know, if you pay your own insurance premiums - they're not deductible, and I don't think reimbursements change that. But again - not sure, verify. However, since you're a salaried employee, even if your own, you can have your employer cover you by a group plan. Even if the group consists of only you. Then, you'll pay your portion as part of the pre-tax salary deduction, and it will be deductible. The employer's portion is a legitimate business expense. Thus, since both the employee and the employer portions are pre-tax - the whole cost of the insurance will be pre-tax. The catch is this: this option has to be available to all of your employees. So if you're hiring an employee a year from now to help you - that employee will be eligible to exactly the same options you have. You cannot only cover owner-employees. If you don't plan on hiring employees any time soon, this point is moot for you, but it is something to keep in mind down the road as you're building and growing your business."

            "You can print them on any IRS-approved paper, you don't have to use pre-printed forms. The IRS publishes specifications for paper that is approved for use for these kinds of forms (109*, W*, etc).  Here's the reason why it is important: Even the slightest deviation can result in incorrect scanning, and may affect money amounts reported for employees. Note that some portions of these forms are in different color (1099-MISC copy A). This is important, and using incorrect color will affect the IRS OCR mechanisms. Forms for individuals are less complicated with regards to technical specifications, because individuals must file them, and as such any complication will unnecessarily burden the citizenry. All the 109*, W* etc forms are not legally required to be filed by all citizens. You're only required to file them if you chose to do business, or chose to employ others. As such, using professional software and special forms is a cost of doing your business, and not a tax as it would be had it been mandatory to everyone. Mistakes in individual forms due to OCR failure or something else will be noticed by the taxpayers (less/more refund, etc) or through the internal matching and cross-check. However, forms 109* and W* feed that matching and cross-check system and are considered source of truth by it, and as such their processing must be much more reliable and precise."

Option #1 - Tell your wife that you are willing to accept a loss up to a certain level because of your long term relationship with your tenant. In a perfect world, the two of you would then discuss what the \"\"magic number\"\" would be where you got out and come to a compromise. For example, if you are comfortable losing up to $3,000 per year and she is unhappy with any loss, you may agree on selling the house when your losses climb to $1,500. In a less perfect world, it would cause an argument as she has already told you what she wants you to do.  Option #2 - Raise the rent to the break even point. From what you've said, this will likely result in the loss of your tenant but you could then rent to someone else for significantly more.  Option #3 - Sell the house. It's an investment property which means it's supposed to make money for you. It can do that very quickly by way of a sale and then it's no longer your problem. Option #4 - Sell the house to your tenant. You bought it for $50,000 and it's currently worth $150,000 (roughly). The problem you face is that property taxes have gone up and caused your mortgage to increase past your tenants ability to pay. My guess is, after 15 years, your payoff is somewhere in the high $20's to mid 30's assuming you got a 30 year loan and haven't refinanced. If you sell to her for say $75,000 (or even up to $90,000) you will still make a profit (wife is happy), she will get a mortgage she can afford and be able to stay in the house (you and the tenant are happy). Added bonus is that her property taxes would be lower (assuming a different rate for investment property in your area).

        "question": "Where do web sites get foreign exchange currency rate / quote information?",
        "answer": "Websites obtain foreign exchange currency rate information from the foreign exchange (FX) market, which operates similarly to the stock market. In this market, potential buying parties bid certain amounts of one country\u2019s currency to buy a unit of another country\u2019s currency, and vice versa for selling parties. The rates fluctuate based on supply and demand, and many factors can influence this including economic conditions, government interventions, and speculation. Governments and central banks may sometimes attempt to \"control\" the value of their currencies by actively purchasing or selling in the FX market to influence exchange rates .\n\nBecause currencies are in some sense commodities, their prices are subject to changes based on demand, and they can rise on news and speculation. For example, remarks by political figures or policies can affect currency values, and these become the exchange rates cited by various online platforms and websites . \n\nFurthermore, the exchange rates that are traded are products of different factors such as a country\u2019s economy, fiscal policies, trading market dynamics, and even speculations on the future values of the currencies, as noted by investment experts like George Soros . \n\nWebsites would typically source this information from financial data providers and market feeds that compile and update currency data in real-time from the FX markets. Some websites use APIs from data providers that specialize in currency exchange rates. These APIs pull data from various sources, including banking institutions and financial markets, to provide up-to-date currency information.",

            "\"The prices quoted are for currency pairs traded on the foreign exchange market. For currencies traded on these exchanges, the exchange rates of a given currency pair are determined by the market, so supply and demand, investor confidence, etc. all play a role. EBS and Reuters are the two primary trading platforms in the foreign exchange market, and much of the data on exchange rates comes from them. Websites will usually get their data either from these sources directly or from a data provider that in turn gets it from EBS, Reuters, or another data source like Bloomberg or Haver Analytics. These data sources aren't free, however.  In the US, many contracts, transactions, etc. that involve exchange rates use the exchange rate data published by the Federal Reserve.

Essentially, for every share of a dividend stock that you own, you are paid a portion of the company's earnings. Most companies pay dividends quarterly, which means at the end of every business quarter, you will receive a check for a certain amount for each share you own.

For example, let\u2019s say Company X pays an annualized dividend of 20 cents per share. Most companies pay dividends quarterly (four times a year), meaning at the end of every business quarter, the company will send a check for 1/4 of 20 cents (or 5 cents) for each share you own. This may not seem like a lot, but when you have built your portfolio up to thousands of shares, and use those dividends to buy more stock in the company, you can make a lot of money over the years. The key is to reinvest those dividends! Source: http://www.dividend.com/dividend-investing-101/what-are-dividend-stocks/ What is an ex dividend date Once the company sets the record date, the ex-dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules. The ex-dividend date is usually set for stocks two business days before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend.

However, it's important to be aware of how many hard inquiries (also known as hard pulls) you have on your credit report within a certain period.

If you're interested in monitoring your score, Credit Karma will let you do that for free.",
            "8 hard inquiries spread over two years is not a negative factor, with a score of 750. Real question #1: How much of your credit limits are you currently using? Less than 30% of your credit limits is good. Less than 15% is even better, 10% is great You don't need to wait X amount of days after applying for a mortgage or a card to increase your chances of getting approved for something else. You do need to be conscious of how many hard pulls you have done in a reporting period though, but again as I said, 8 spread over two years is not a whole lot. Real question #2: What negative things do you have in your credit history? Young age, income, delinquent payments, bankruptcies, low limits? Some of these negative factors are catch-22's (low limits, young age = low limits because of age and young credit history)  but these contribute to how much institutions would be willing to lend you",
            "Specific to the inquiries, from my Impact of Credit Inquiries article -    8 is at the high end pulling your score down until some time passes. As MB stated, long term expanding your credit will help, but short term, it's a bit of a hit.",
            "My recommendation is to not ask for a credit increase, but just increase the utilization of one card if you have multiple cards, and decrease the utilization of the others, and continue paying off all cards in full each month.  In a  few months, you  will likely be offered a credit increase by the card that is getting increased use.  The card company that is getting the extra business knows that you are paying off big bills each month and keeping your account in good standing, and they will likely offer you a credit increase all by themselves because they want to keep your business.  If no offer is forthcoming, you can call the card company and ask for a credit increase. If they refuse, tell them that you will be charging very little on the card in the future  (or even canceling your card, though that will cause a hit on your credit score) because of their refusal, and switch your high volume to a different card."

        "question": "Why should a company go public?",
        "answer": "A company may choose to go public for several reasons. Primarily, going public is a way to raise money. This additional capital can then be used to invest in the business, pay off existing shareholders, or both. Compared to other methods of fundraising such as debt or selling equity to venture capitalists, going public often offers more favorable terms for the company due to the liquidity of the market. Additionally, being publicly traded can give a company increased visibility and can allow it to be valued more highly based on potential future cash flows, thereby benefiting investors and employees with stock options or RSUs as well .\n\nGoing public usually follows after a company has grown past the initial venture funding phase. It is seen as the next step in the company's growth. However, there are costs associated with being publicly traded, such as regulatory compliance costs in the US, which can run around $1 million per year. These need to be considered when determining the cost-effectiveness of going public .\n\nThere are also potential downsides to going public, including more regulation, required financial disclosures, and the need to address stockholder concerns. Despite these disadvantages, companies often decide that the benefits, like the injection of funds and the high valuation of their company, outweigh the cons of becoming a publicly traded entity .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "You go public to raise money, to invest in the business and/or pay off the existing shareholders. It's really as simple as that. The advantage of being public is that your shares can easily be bought and sold, and so you can issue and sell new ones and your existing shareholders can sell out if they want to. The disadvantage is that you are much more tightly regulated, with more disclosure requirements, and also that you are exposed to much more pressure from your shareholders to maintain and increase your share price.",
            "Most businesses want to grow, and there are a variety of ways to raise the money needed to hire new employees and otherwise invest in the business to increase the rate of that growth. You as a stock holder should hope that management is choosing the least expensive option for growth. Some of the options are debt, selling equity to venture capitalists, or selling equity on the open market (going public). If they choose debt, they pay interest on that debt. If they choose to sell equity to venture capitalists, then your shares get diluted, but hopefully the growth makes up for some of that dilution. If they choose to go public, dilution is still a concern, but the terms are usually a little more favorable for the company selling because the market is so liquid.  In the US, current regulations for publicly traded companies cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $1M/year, so that's the rule of thumb for considering whether going public makes sense when calculating the cost of fundraising, but as mentioned, regulations make it less advantageous for executives who choose to sell their shares after the company goes public. (They can't sell when good spot prices appear.) Going public is often considered the next step for a company that has grown past the initial venture funding phase, but if cash-flow is good, plenty of companies decide to just reinvest profits and skip the equity markets altogether.",
            "\"The reason to go public is to get money. Not to be snarky, but your question is like asking, \"\"Why should a company try to sell its products, when if they just piled them up in a warehouse they wouldn't have to worry about shipping and customer complaints and collecting sales tax?\"\" The answer, of course, is because they want the money. Sure, there are disadvantages to going public, like more regulation, required financial disclosures, and having to answer to stockholders. That's the price you pay for accepting money from people. They're not going to give you money for nothing.\"",
            "The purpose is to go public but also to generate more wealth. The real money comes when market values you at a price more than your cash flow. If a company brings in $1000 of cash flow, then that is what the employees and owners have to distribute among themselves. But if they are likely to increase to $2000 next and $4000 next year and they go public then the stock will do well. In this case, the promoters and employees with options/RSUs will benefit as well. The increased visibility is also very useful. Look at Google or FB. They didn't need the IPO proceed when they went public. They had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $1-10 billion a year. But due to the IPO their investors and employees have a huge net worth.  Basically, with just a small % of shares in the public you can value the company at a high price valuing in the future cash flows (with a discount rate etc.). So instead of realizing the profit over the next 15 years, you get to enjoy it right away."

        "question": "At what age should I start or stop saving money?",
        "answer": "There is no specific age to start or stop saving money, and it varies depending on individual circumstances. The information from the document states that there is no lower age limit to begin saving money. In fact, the sooner you start, the better, as it allows your money more time to grow and compound, potentially turning into a considerable sum when you are ready to retire if you invest it aggressively .\n\nIt is suggested that saving should be taught to children as soon as they are old enough to receive an allowance. For someone just starting to save, aiming to put away 10% of income is a common recommendation. Even college graduates are advised to save 15% if they can manage it. However, it is emphasized that saving money makes sense only if it doesn't prevent you from paying off expensive debt. Paying down high-interest debts such as credit card debt should take precedence over saving. Still, it is worthwhile to save a small amount for an emergency fund while working on debt repayment .\n\nRemember that these are guidelines rather than strict rules. Start saving whatever amount you can and try to increase your savings rate over time, perhaps by saving half of any future raises and using the other half for spending. The key is to begin as soon as possible and then adjust according to your financial situation and goals .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "As AskAboutGadgets notes, there's no lower age limit.  You current age (24) is a pretty good one; you'll have four decades or so for your money to grow and compound, allowing it to become a veritable fortune when you're ready to retire if you invest it fairly aggressively.",
            "While there is no age limit, bear in mind that saving money makes sense only if it doesn't delay your paying off expensive debt. If you have credit cards or expensive loans you would be best placed to focus on paying them down before saving a lot. If you save and keep debt, you'll effectively lose money as the interest on your debt will usually be higher than you can earn on savings. Having said that, it's worth saving a small amount anyway to have as an emergency fund. As you pay off your debt, start saving the money you no longer have to pay out and it will soon pay dividends.",
            "Are you working? Does your employer offer a 401(k) and if so, is there any match?  Saving should be taught to kids at the same time they are old enough to get an allowance.

If you find that the 10% is too much, just start with what you can spare, and work to build that up over time, perhaps by splitting any future raises, half going toward savings, half to spending.

            "It's nearly always a good idea to save for your future, if you don't already have sufficient funds to see out the rest of your days. The hardest part of the saving decision is knowing exactly what portion of your funds to save. If we save too aggressively, we risk having an adverse impact on our everyday life and, of course, there's always the possibility that we'll never make it to old age. But if we don't save, we risk the prospect of a poverty stricken retirement. It's not always easy to find a balance. The best solution is to make so much money that we cannot possibly spend it all!",
            "You've never saved money?  Have you ever bought anything?  There probably was a small window of time that you had to pool some cash to buy something.    In my experience, if you make it more interesting by 'allocating money for specific purposes' you'll have better results than just arbitrarily saving for a rainy day.    Allocate your money for different things (ie- new car, emergency, travel, or starting a new business) by isolating your money into different places.  Ex- your new car allocation could be in a savings account at your bank.   Your emergency allocation can be in cash under your bed.   Your new business allocation could be in an investment vehicle like a stocks where it could potentially see significant gains by the time you are ready to use it.    The traditional concept of savings is gone.  There is very little money to be earned in a savings account and any gains will be most certainly wiped out by inflation anyway.  Allocate your money, allocate more with new income, and then use it to buy real things and fund new adventures when the time is right."

It is also a good practice to update the information with your registered state, depending on state requirements.\n\nIf the addition of a new member changes the tax classification of the LLC (for example, from a single-member LLC to a multi-member LLC, which is generally treated as a partnership for tax purposes), an IRS Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, might need to be filed to elect how the LLC is classified for federal tax purposes.

According to the document I found, in certain jurisdictions like Ontario, there is nothing specifically legislated about resignation notice, leaving room for contract-specified requirements. If an employee fails to respect the agreed notice period, they can potentially be sued for provable losses that the employer suffers as a result of the employee's premature departure. These losses are calculated minus any savings the employer might have from not having to pay the salary of the departing employee .\n\nAdditionally, the standard notice period in some regions, such as Canada, is reported to be two weeks for both the employer and employee. Should an employee violate this notice requirement, the employer might sue for lost revenues and other damages incurred during the period for which notice was not given. Similarly, if an employer fails to provide sufficient notice to an employee, the employee can sue for lost wages for that time frame .\n\nIt's worth noting that the actual consequences can depend largely on the employer and the contractual agreement between the employer and employee, as well as on the jurisdiction's laws and regulations.

Ontario, on the other hand doesn't have anything legislated about resignation notice except under a couple very specific circumstances.

It is possible they may have written off the account and closed it, selling it to a debt collector in order to get some sort of return on debt.

        "question": "Is working on a W2 basis, with benefits paid to me, a good idea?",
        "answer": "As a chatbot, I can provide general information on what working on a W2 basis with benefits paid to you may entail, which can help you assess whether it's a good idea for your individual situation. However, the best decision will depend on your personal circumstances, career goals, and preferences, as well as the specifics of the job offer and company policies.\n\nWorking on a W2 basis means you are considered an employee of the company. Here are some potential advantages and considerations for working as a W2 employee with benefits:\n\n1. **Stability and Consistency**: W2 employees are typically hired for long-term positions, which provides a level of job security and consistent income. As a W2 employee, you may also have predictable work hours and clearer career progression within the organization.\n\n2. **Employee Benefits**: Companies often offer benefits such as health insurance, dental and vision plans, retirement savings plans (like 401(k)), life insurance, and paid time off (PTO). These benefits can significantly contribute to your overall compensation package and personal well-being.\n\n3. **Tax Withholding and Filing**: Taxes are withheld from your paycheck, making the process more straightforward. As a W2 employee, you don't need to worry about quarterly tax payments as you would if you were a contractor or self-employed.\n\n4. **Legal Protections and Rights**: Employees have legal protections such as minimum wage, overtime pay, workers' compensation, and unemployment insurance. You may also be covered by anti-discrimination laws, and you're eligible for family and medical leave under certain conditions.\n\n5. **Career Development**: Employers may offer training and professional development opportunities to W2 employees as they have invested interest in their workforce's growth.\n\n6. **Less Paperwork**: As a W2 employee, you don't need to handle the administrative tasks that an independent contractor would, like invoicing and contract negotiation.\n\nOn the other hand, working as a W2 employee may have some downsides, such as less flexibility in choosing projects or work hours, and the potential of becoming too reliant on one source of income.\n\nUltimately, whether working on a W2 basis with benefits is a good idea depends on what you value in your career and personal life. It might be helpful to consult with a career advisor or tax professional to discuss the specifics of your situation and make an informed decision.

W2 with benefits: Likely would have been beneficial if you needed healthcare (since group plans can be cheaper than individual plans, and healthcare payments aren't taxed), but if you don't use the healthcare, that would have been a waste. W2, no benefits: Assuming your salary here falls between the 1099 and the W2 with benefits, it seems like a good compromise for your situation."

        "question": "How do I calculate tax liability on the turnover of a small vendor?",
        "answer": "To calculate tax liability on the turnover of a small vendor, you should be aware of the following:\n\n1. **Determine the Gross Income**: Your gross income from a self-employed business that provides services is the gross receipts. If the business involves manufacturing, merchandising, or mining, your gross income is total sales minus the cost of goods sold. You should add any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources .\n\n2. **Business Expenses**: Deduct valid business expenses from your gross income to find your net income, which will be your taxable income for income tax purposes.\n\n3. **Self-Employment Tax**: If you are self-employed, you will need to file a Schedule SE with your 1040. This is for the social security taxes you owe, which is in addition to your income taxes. As a self-employed individual, you are responsible for the worker's share of FICA and the employer's share which, in this case, is known as self-employment tax .\n\n4. **Estimated Payments**: You are required to make federal 1040ES quarterly prepayments of your tax. If these payments are not made on time, there could be penalties .\n\n5. **Safe Harbor Rule**: If your previous year's adjusted gross income was $150,000 or less, then you can avoid a penalty if you pay either 90 percent of this year's income tax liability or 100 percent of your previous year's tax liability .\n\n6. **Calculating Self-Employment Tax**: To calculate the tax owed, take your income and divide by 1.0765, which accounts for Social Security and Medicare taxes. Multiply the result by 0.153 to account for both the worker and employer shares of the tax .\n\nYou can use tools like the Excel 1040 spreadsheet, which is an unofficial version of the tax return form that helps you estimate your federal taxes by allowing you to plug in various numbers and see how they affect your federal tax liability .\n\nIt's important to ensure that these calculations are done according to the tax laws and regulations applicable to your specific situation, including state taxes if applicable. If you are new to this or need further guidance, it is recommended to visit the IRS website at https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed or consult with a tax professional who can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances .",

However, creating a graph to compare the Dow Jones Index (or any market index) year over year typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical data for the Dow Jones Index. This data should include the index values at consistent time intervals, usually at the end of each year.\n\n2. **Data Processing**: Adjust the data for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions to ensure an accurate representation of the index's performance.\n\n3. **Graph Creation**: Plot the adjusted historical data on a graph. The x-axis will represent time (years), and the y-axis will represent the index value. Each point on the graph should correspond to the index value at the end of the respective year.\n\n4. **Analysis**: Draw comparisons between the data points to analyze the index's performance over different years. Look for trends, patterns, or notable changes, which might require further investigation.\n\nIt's important to use a statistical software or a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets that supports plotting time series data for this task.

        "question": "How to find cheaper alternatives to a traditional home telephone line?",
        "answer": "One of the ways to find cheaper alternatives to a traditional home telephone line is to use a prepaid pay-per-minute VOIP service. With such a service, you can have a low monthly fee (less than $2/month) for the incoming number, a small fee for 911 service (around 80 cents/month), and pay per minute for outgoing calls at a rate typically less than 1 cent/minute to destinations such as the US, Canada, and western Europe. To set up VOIP at home, you can use devices such as the Obitalk box, which costs under $50. Several companies in the US/Canada offer BYOD (bring your own device) VOIP services, including Anveo, Callcentric, Callwithus, Futurenine, Localphone, and Voip.ms.\n\nAdditionally, VOIP companies typically provide free \"on network\" calls between their customers, which can be advantageous if you have relatives abroad who also use the same service. By setting up ATA (analog telephone adapter) devices like Obitalk boxes in both your and your relatives' homes, you can make free calls within the network.\n\nMoreover, communication technologies like UberConference, Skype, and Webinar now offer audio/video and web conferencing services that can further reduce phone bills. They come with various service tiers from free plans to business plans, allowing you to choose what suits your needs and potentially replace the traditional home phone line with web-enabled conference calling services . \n\nPlease note that not every company provides incoming numbers in every area, and the ability to port in an existing number varies from provider to provider, so it's important to verify these details when considering a switch.",

            "Cheapest is one thing.  You can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price.  I can think of three places to shop, each with an up and downside. I would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service.  Just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have. Decide what features you need.  Do you need long distance?  Do you need caller id?  Do you need to call technophobic friends and family? Find out what you have available to you through associations.  Often schools, work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts.  Look at your insurance plan or AAA membership for the crazy discounts. Decide what kinds of service will meet your needs. Buy the cheapest service. DO NOT ENTER A CONTRACT.  Even if the price is slightly lower.  At least not at first.  If you try out your service and love it, enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less.  With cell phones especially, it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract.  Even when you buy equipment for full price up front. Ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company. Because phone companies are often regulated monopolies, they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality.  They probably don't advertise it or push it, but it might exist if you call and ask.  You basically get a dial tone. http://www.fcc.gov/guides/local-local-toll-and-long-distance-calling Price is dictated by a government board, so you don't have to worry about shopping for deals Not the cheapest possible solution This is popular plan the youth oriented market, but more and more people of all demographics are using their cellphones only.  There are downsides (911, etc) and shopping for the best cell phone plan can be a full time job, but it does offer a way to save money by simply not having home phone service. Might be possible to score organizational discounts through work or groups you belong to Cellphones require batteries, and can go dead (not good for emergencies) Voice over Internet Protocol uses your existing Internet connection.  You can buy a cheap regular phone and plug it into the VOIP box and use it like any other phone.  VOIP can either be very inexpensive for all the features you get, or just plain inexpensive.  There are providers who sell a monthly service, yearly service or no service plan at all. (You buy a device and get service as long as you own the device.)  Taxes to the government are always due, so nothing is ever free. Sometimes the provider is just computer software, so a minimalist would like that. Emergency services are more reliable than cellular (if you follow extra steps to set them up) Can be confusing to buy.  Some require contracts, some special devices, some require a bit of technical know how to setup.  Be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing prices",
            "\"How low you can reduce your costs does depend on your calling pattern.  How many minutes per month you call locally; call long distance; call internationally; and how many minutes you receive calls for.  If all these figures are low, you can be better off with a pay-per-minute service, if any of the outbound figures are high then you could consider a flat-rate \"\"unlimited\"\" service.  So that's the first step, determine your needs: don't pay for what you don't need. For example, I barely use a \"\"landline\"\" voip phone any more.  But it is still useful for incoming calls, and for 911 service.  So I use a prepaid pay-per-minute VOIP company, that has a flat rate (< $2/mo) for the incoming number, an add-on fee for the 911 service (80c/mo), and per-minute costs for outgoing calls (1c/min or less to US, Canada, western Europe).  I use my own Obitalk box (under $50 to buy).  There is a bit of setup and learning needed, but the end result means my \"\"landline\"\" bill is usually under $4/mo (no other taxes or fees). Companies in this BYOD (bring your own device) space in the US/Canada include (in alphabetic order), Anveo, Callcentric, Callwithus, Futurenine, Localphone, Voip.ms and many others.  A good discussion forum to learn more about them is the VOIP forum at DSLreports (although it can be a bit technical).  There is also a reviews section at that site. If your usage is higher (you make lots of calls to a variety of numbers), most of these companies, and others, have flat-rate bundles, probably similar to what you have now.  Comparing them depends on your usage pattern, so again that's the first thing to consider, then you know what to shop for.  If you need features like voicemail or voicemail transcription, be sure to look at whether you need an expensive bundle with it in, or whether you're better off paying for that seperately. If your outbound calls are to a limited number of numbers, such as relatives far away or internationally, consider getting a similar VOIP system for those relatives.  Most VOIP companies have free \"\"on network\"\" calls between their customers, regardless of the country they are in.  So your most common, and most lengthy calls, could be free. The Obitalk boxes (ATA's: analog telephone adapters) have an advantage here, if you install them in yours and relatives houses.  As well as allowing you to use any of the \"\"bring your own device\"\" VOIP companies like those listed above, they have their own Obitalk network allowing free calls between their boxes, and also to/from their iOS and Android apps.  There are other ATA's from other companies (Cisco have well-known models), and other ways to make free calls between them, so Obitalk isn't the only option.  I mentioned above I pay for the incoming number.  Not every supplier has incoming numbers available in every area, you need to check this.  Some can port-in (transfer in) your existing number, if you are attached to it, but not all can, so again check. You can also get incoming numbers in other areas or countries, that ring on your home line (without forwarding costs).  This means you can have a number near a cluster of relatives, who can call you with a local call.  Doesn't directly save you money (each number has a monthly fee) but could save you having to call them back!\"",
            "Try to use VOIP service provider or web enabled conference calling services in your home phone. Now a days communication technologies have seen a boost as well as integration of different formats and platforms which easily reduces phone bills of a user.  Service such as UberConference, Skype, Webinar etc enables audio/video as well as web conferencing feature for their user.  Service tiers such as free plans, basic plans and business plans allow user to use these conference calling services per their need. Have a look at any such service and use it as an alternative of your home phone line."

        "question": "How to pay with cash when car shopping?",
        "answer": "When shopping for a car, paying with cash can sometimes offer certain advantages. According to the document, cash can be effective at getting a discount, particularly when buying from private sales such as through Craigslist, garage sales, estate sales, flea markets, etc. It is mentioned that for well-loved cars (under $10K) from both individuals or used dealers, negotiating with cash has proven to be successful. Some merchants give discounts for cash payments as they avoid having to pay interchange fees on transactions, and in some cases, to reduce their tax liability, although the latter is not endorsed as legal or ethical behavior.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that car dealerships are unique in that they tend to make substantial money from offering financing, which could impact the likelihood of a cash discount. All car sales also need to be registered with the state, so there are alternative records of sales that can be traced, making it less likely for a dealership to discount for cash for the purpose of underreporting sales.\n\nIn practical terms, if you intend to pay with cash at a dealership, it is still considered a good practice to have your bank or credit union's loan approval in hand because it allows you to negotiate the best purchase price. This is because to the dealer, a pre-approved loan can be considered equivalent to a cash payment, potentially leading to discounts or rebates just like a cash purchase would.\n\nIn all cases, it's advisable to be upfront about your payment method and to negotiate based on the total purchase price of the car rather than on monthly payments, whether you're paying with cash or financing your purchase .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "I have in the last few years purchased several used cars from dealers. They have handled it two different ways. They accepted a small check ~$1,000 now, and then gave me three business days to bring the rest as a cashiers check. They also insisted that I submit a application for credit, in case I needed a loan.  They accepted a personal check on the spot. Ask them before you drive to the dealer. Of course they would love you to get a loan from them.",
            "You could write a personal check after the final price has been set and you're ready to purchase. Another option would be to get the final price - then walk over to your bank and get a cashier's check.",
            "I usually get a cashiers check to cover about 90% - 95% of the expected amount (whatever I think is just below my wet-dream-price), and bring the rest in cash. That doesn't require so much cash to be carried. Alternatively you can write a personal check for the exact reminder, or go to the bank for the reminder after the deal is made - with the majority already paid in a cashiers check nobody would disagree.",
            "When you pay cash for a car, you don't always necessarily need to pay cash. You just aren't using credit or a loan is all. A few options you have are: Obviously no dealer expects anyone to just have the cash laying around for a car worth a few thousand dollars, nor would you bother going to your bank or credit union for the cash. You can simply get a cashier's check made out for the amount. Note that dealers may not accept personal checks as they may bounce.  After negotiations at the dealer, you would explain you're paying cash, likely pay a deposit (depending on the price of the car, but $500 would probably be enough. Again, the deposit can be a check or bank deposit), and then come back later on with a cashier's check, or deposit into a bank account. You would be able to do this later that day or within a few days, but since you've purchased a new car you would probably want to return ASAP!",
            "You can pay with a cashiers check or personal check. You can even pay cash, or combine payment methods. However, in the USA if you give the dealership $10,000 or more in actual cash, they will be required to fill out a form 8300 with the IRS.",
            "Ask the dealer to drive to the bank with you, if they really want cash.",
            "The very first time I bought a new car I wrote out a personal check for $5000 (this was a looong time ago!).  And got a call from the sales person that he had called the bank and was told that I did not have that much money in my checking account!  I explained that I had just that day transferred money from savings to checking.  The sales person accepted that and there was never a problem after that."

        "answer": "If you receive a job offer with a salary that is less than what you asked for, here are some steps you could consider:\n\n1.

Consider the importance of the job to you and whether it aligns with your career goals, even if the salary offered is lower than your expectation.\n\n3. If you feel that the salary offered is a deal-breaker, you can attempt to negotiate. Convey to the employer that the salary is a primary concern and that you are willing to discuss other possibilities. Be prepared to provide reasons why you believe a higher salary is justified.\n\n4. If negotiation is not possible and you decide to accept the offer, you could propose a performance review in a few months. Some employers might interpret this as an intent to discuss a salary raise based on your performance, which could potentially lead to a salary increase .\n\n5.

In this analogy, the \"Bobs\" are like investors who might buy stocks (or baseball cards) during speculative bubbles, while the \"Daves\" represent those seeking a reliable income stream, similar to those who might invest in dividend-paying stocks or other income-producing assets. The analogy breaks down when it comes to actual value production, as baseball cards don't typically produce an income just by owning them, unlike companies which can issue dividends\u2014a fundamental difference between the two types of investment.\n\nTo summarize elements of this discussion:\n\n- \"Daves\" are compared with investors looking for long-term holdings that produce reliable, growing income streams.\n- \"Bobs\" tend to buy assets during speculative bubbles and may not be aware of the underlying value or the function of the assets they purchase.\n- The document also touches on the notion that investors in companies (like shareholders) can influence decisions through voting in a board of directors, whereas baseball card owners have no such power.\n\nHere is the detailed portion from the document that provides the analogy:\n\n\"Baseball cards don't pay dividends. But many profitable companies do just that, and those that don't could, some day. Profits & dividends is where your analogy falls apart. But let's take it further. Consider: If baseball cards could somehow yield a regular stream of income just for owning them, then there might be yet another group of people, call them the Daves. These Daves I know are the kind of people that would like to own baseball cards over the long term just for their income-producing capability. Daves would seek out the cards with the best chance of producing and growing a reliable income stream. They wouldn't necessarily care about being able to flip a card at an inflated price to a Bob, but they might take advantage of inflated prices once in a while. Heck, even some of the Steves would enjoy this income while they waited for the eventual capital gain made by selling to a Bob at a higher price... A card with a good income stream might even have more value to a Dave than to a Bob, because a Dave doesn't care as much about the popularity of the player.\"\n\n\"You're right \u2013 stockholders can't simply claim their percentage of a company's assets. Rather, shareholders vote in a board of directors. The board of directors can decide whether or not to issue dividends or buy back shares, each of which puts money back in your pocket\" .\n\nThis elucidates that while there is a superficial similarity in the act of trading itself, the underlying nature of what is being traded, the expectations of the traders, and their influence on the asset are fundamentally different between the stock market and baseball card trading.",

Plus, the Steves could also sell their cards to Daves, not just Bobs.  Daves would be willing to pay more for a card based on its income stream: how reliable it is, how high it is, how fast it grows, and where it is relative to market interest rates.  A card with a good income stream might even have more value to a Dave than to a Bob, because a Dave doesn't care as much about the popularity of the player. Addendum regarding your comment: I suppose I'm still struggling with the best way to present my   question. I understand that companies differ in this aspect in that   they produce value. But if stockholders cannot simply claim a   percentage of a company's value equal to their share, then the fact   that companies produce value seems irrelevant to the \"\"Bobs\"\". You're right \u2013 stockholders can't simply claim their percentage of a company's assets. Rather, shareholders vote in a board of directors.  The board of directors can decide whether or not to issue dividends or buy back shares, each of which puts money back in your pocket.  A board could even decide to dissolve the company and distribute the net assets (after paying debts and dissolution costs) to the shareholders \u2013 but this is seldom done because there's often more profit in remaining a going concern. I think perhaps what you are getting hung up on is the idea that a small shareholder can't command the company to give net assets in exchange for shares.  Instead, generally speaking, a company runs somewhat like a democracy \u2013 but it's each share that gets a vote, not each shareholder. Since you can't redeem your shares back to the company on demand, there exists a secondary market \u2013 the stock market \u2013 where somebody else is willing to take over your investment based on what they perceive the value of your shares to be \u2013 and that market value is often different from the underlying \"\"book value\"\" per share.\"",
            "The Bobs tend to show up at the top of bubbles, then disappear soon after. For example, your next door neighbor who talks about Oracle in 1999, even though he doesn't know what Oracle does for a living. I don't think the Bobs' assets represent a large chunk of the market's value.  A better analogy would be a spectrum of characters, each with different time horizons. Everyone from the high-frequency trader to the investor who buys and holds until death.",
            "\"Actually, this is a pretty good analogy to certain types of stocks, specifically tech and other \"\"fad\"\" stocks. Around the turn of the century, there were a lot of \"\"Bobs\"\" buying tech stocks (like they would baseball cards), for tech stocks' sakes. That's what drove the internet and tech stock bubbles of high valuations. At other times, the tech stocks are bought and sold mainly by \"\"Steve's\"\" for business reasons such as likely (not merely possible) future appreciation, and command a much lower valuation.\""

        "answer": "The search results do not specifically mention the typical number of digits in a cheque number. Cheque numbers are used for identification of the cheque and are printed in two places on the front of each check: in the upper right corner and along the bottom edge. The cheque number scanned by the bank is the one along the bottom edge . However, since the number of digits is not mentioned in the document, I would rely on common banking practices to answer your question.\n\nTypically, cheque numbers are 3 to 6 digits long. The exact length can vary depending on the bank and the country. If you need information specific to checks from a certain bank or region, it would be best to consult the bank's cheque specification or customer service for precise details.",

The check number takes as many digits as it takes, depending on how long the account has been open and thus how many checks have been written.  The most recent check I looked at had a four-digit number, but as has been pointed out businesses may run through thousands  per year. I recommend storing this in an unsigned long or long-long, which will probably be comparable to the bank's own limits.

        "question": "How can I detect potential fraud in a company before investing in them?",
        "answer": "Detecting potential fraud in a company before investing can be challenging. According to the document you provided, due to the criminal nature of fraudulent activities and the lengths to which fraudsters go to hide their actions, it's very unlikely that an investor could detect fraud beforehand, especially if they're from a different country. It is also noted that employing a skeptical mindset and remembering that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is, can serve as a basic guideline. Additionally, by sticking to relatively large companies, you might benefit from more robust auditing requirements, which can make fraud more difficult to conceal, although large-scale frauds like Enron have occurred.\n\nThe controls and regulations in place, such as external audits and official reporting channels, are meant to reduce the risk of fraud significantly. However, these measures aren't foolproof, as some companies still manage to commit fraud and conceal it from the public and authorities. Such fraudulent activity is considered a black swan event\u2014an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences.\n\nOne strategy mentioned to protect yourself against these black swan events, such as a company's fraudulent collapse, is buying out-of-the-money puts on the stocks where you have an investment. This means that in the event of a severe drop in the stock's value, the profits from the puts could help offset the losses. However, this strategy comes with its own costs and isn't a direct means of detecting fraud before it happens.\n\nOverall, while it might not be feasible to detect fraud with the resources and information available to most investors, diversifying your investment and considering protective measures like options trading can help mitigate potential losses related to fraudulent activities .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Given that such activities are criminal and the people committing them have to hide them from the law, it's very unlikely that an investor could detect them, let alone one from a different country. The only things that can realistically help is to keep in mind the adage \"\"If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is\"\", and to stick to relatively large companies, since they have more auditing requirements and fraud is much harder to hide at scale (but not impossible, see Enron). Edit: and, of course, diversify. This kind of thing is rare, and not systematic, so diversification is a very good protection.\"",
            "Most of the information we get about how a company is running its business, in any market, comes from the company. If the information is related to financial statements, it is checked by an external audit, and then provided to the public through official channels. All of these controls are meant to make it very unlikely for a firm to commit fraud or to cook its books. In that sense the controls are successful, very few firms provide fraudulent information to the public compared with the thousands of companies that list in stock markets around the world.  Now, there is still a handful of firms that have committed fraud, and it is probable that a few firms are committing fraud right now. But, these companies go to great lengths to keep information about their fraud hidden from both the public and the authorities. All of these factors contribute to such frauds being black swan events to the outside observer.  A black swan event is an event that is highly improbable, impossible to foresee with the information available before the event (it can only be analyzed in retrospect), and it has very large impact. The classification of an event as a black swan depends on your perspective. E.g. the Enron collapse was not as unexpected to the Enron executives as it was to its investors.  You cannot foresee black swan events, but there are a few strategies that allow you to insure yourself against them. One such strategy is buying out of the money puts in the stocks where you have an investment, the idea being that in the event of a crash - due to fraud or whatever other reason - the profits in your puts would offset the loses on the stock. This strategy however suffers from time and loses a little money every day that the black swan doesn't show up, thanks to theta decay.  So while it is not possible to detect fraud before investing, or at least not feasible with the resources and information available to the average investor, it is possible to obtain some degree of protection against it, at a cost. Whether that cost is too high or not, is the million dollar question.",
            "Even without fraud, a company can get into serious trouble overnight, often through no fault of their own. That's part of the hazard of being part owner of a company -- which is what a share of stock is. As a minority owner not involved in actually running the business, there really isn't a lot you can do about that excep to play the odds and think about how that risk compares to the profit you're taking (which is one reason the current emphasis on stock price rather than dividends is considered a departure from traditional investing) and, as everyone else has said, avoid putting too much of your wealth in one place."

        "answer": "Opening a small account with a credit union and then immediately applying for a large loan does not constitute \"cheating the system\" in a legal sense. Credit unions, like banks, are in the business of lending money at a profit by charging interest rates higher than what they offer on savings . They have membership requirements because they are structured as cooperatives where the members are also owners of the union; this often entails purchasing a share to open an account . \n\nHowever, from an ethical or practical standpoint, the credit union is interested in serving its members, and part of that includes assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. If a new account is opened with minimal funds and a large loan is requested right away, the credit union may scrutinize the application more closely. It's essential for the institution to ensure that the members they lend to are likely to repay their debts, as this is critical for the credit union's viability and the financial well-being of all its members.\n\nWhen considering a loan, it's often a good practice to establish a relationship with the financial institution, perhaps by showing a history of responsible financial behavior or discussing your financial situation and loan needs with a loan officer . By doing so, you are not trying to manipulate or exploit loopholes but are working within the framework of the credit union's lending criteria. \n\nRemember, taking on a significant loan places a responsibility on you to make timely repayments, and the credit union will likely evaluate your ability to do so based on your credit history, capacity to repay, and your collateral, among other factors. It is advisable to ensure that you have a solid plan for repayment before taking on a sizeable financial commitment.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Nope.  Credit Unions are for the customers.  Since the customers own them, the credit union does what is best for the members.  They aren't giving you money, they are loaning it to you for for interest.  Furthermore then judged you like any other bank would. High horse moment: I believe the only reason you have to open an account, is because the banking industry didn't want to compete and got legislation to limit the size and reach of a credit union.   The credit union wants your business, and they want to work for you, but they are required to have these membership requirements because their lobby isn't as powerful as regular banks.",
            "\"Credit unions require you to open an account because of their history. A credit union is just that: a union. Only instead of a union of workers collectively bargaining for better pay or worker's comp, they are lending each other money. They are chartered to offer their services to members of the union, rather than the public at large.  For that reason, credit unions historically had targeted niche memberships (ie, employees at a specific company, or property with a specific hobby such as fishing). Most credit unions these days attempt to skirt the issue, by claiming to serve members of a specific geographic area. Anyway, membership is defined a owning a stake in the union, which is usually termed a share. By opening the account and \"\"purchasing a share,\"\" you are becoming both an owner and member of the union, and are eligible for their services. That's why the account is required before you can have a loan.\"",

        "question": "How does unemployment insurance work?",
        "answer": "Unemployment insurance is designed to provide a temporary safety net for workers who have lost their jobs. Here's a breakdown of how it typically works:\n\n1. **Purpose:** Unemployment insurance replaces a portion of the salary of workers who have lost their jobs, to help cover the essentials of living, such as food and utilities, until they find new employment .\n\n2. **Eligibility:** To be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, a worker must have lost their job through no fault of their own, such as a layoff due to business closure or downsizing. If the job loss is due to quitting or poor performance, the person may not be eligible .\n\n3. **State Variation:** Each state administers its own unemployment insurance program, so rules and benefit amounts can vary by state. Typically, a percentage of the worker's previous pay is used to calculate benefits, generally ranging between 20 percent and 50 percent, depending on state regulations .\n\n4. **Funding:** Unemployment insurance is funded through employer payroll taxes rather than employee earnings. Employers' taxes are based on several factors, including the number of former employees who have received benefits and the employer's history with the unemployment system. Therefore, different businesses may pay different rates .\n\n5. **Application and Verification:** Upon applying for unemployment insurance, the state agency will verify the claimant's situation by contacting the previous employer. The claimant must also have worked sufficiently before they can claim benefits .\n\n6. **Duration and Extensions:** Regular unemployment benefits are typically provided for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states. However, during periods of high unemployment, additional weeks of extended unemployment benefits may be available through various tiers of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) .\n\n7. **Waiting Period:** Before receiving benefits, a waiting period of one or two weeks is usually required. If a new job is found during this waiting period, the claimant will not be eligible for benefits, even if the new job pays less than the previous one .\n\nRemember, this is a general overview, and the specifics can vary from state to state, so it's important to check with the state's unemployment insurance agency for detailed information relevant to your location.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Unemployment insurance provides a temporary safety net to workers who lose their jobs by replacing a portion of their salary for certain periods. Each state administers its own unemployment insurance program so some rules may vary from state to state. To receive unemployment insurance payments, you must have lost your job through no fault of your own. If you quit your job or lost it because of poor performance or another justifiable reason, you are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. State unemployment insurance programs require claimants to have worked sufficiently before they can claim benefits. As soon as you apply for unemployment insurance, an agency with the state in which you live will verify that you were a victim of a layoff by contacting your previous employer and making sure you lost your job due to lack of work and not an action within your control. After the state verifies you were indeed the victim of a layoff, your weekly payment is calculated. Your payment will be a percentage of what you made in your previous job, generally between 20 percent and 50 percent, depending on your state. Unemployment insurance replaces only a portion of your previous pay because it is intended to pay only for the essentials of living such as food and utilities until you find new employment. Before you begin receiving benefits, you must complete a waiting period of typically one or two weeks. If you find a new job during this period, you will not be eligible for unemployment benefits, even if the job does not pay you as much as your previous job. After the waiting period, you will begin to receive your weekly payments. Employers pay for unemployment insurance through payroll taxes. So, while employees' work and earnings history are important to funding their unemployment benefits, the money does not come from their pay. Employer unemployment insurance contributions depend on several factors, including how many former employees have received benefits. Employers pay taxes on an employee's base wages, which vary by state. California, for example taxes employers on the first $7,000 of an employee's annual earnings, while neighboring Oregon taxes up to $32,000 of wages. Employers must set aside funds each payroll period and then report taxes and pay their states quarterly. States have several categories of tax rates they charge employers. New businesses and those first adding employees pay the \"\"new rate,\"\" which is typically lower and geared toward small businesses. Established businesses who haven't paid their taxes recently or properly are usually assessed the \"\"standard rate\"\" --- the highest possible tax rate, which in 2010 ranged from 5.4 percent in several states including Georgia, Hawaii and Alaska to 13.56 percent in Pennsylvania. Businesses in good standing may receive discounts under the \"\"experienced rate.\"\" Depending on the number of employees a business has and how many former employees have claimed unemployment, states can give sizable rate reductions. The fewer claims, the lower the rate a business pays in unemployment insurance taxes. As a result of the economic crisis legislation has been passed to extend Unemployment benefits.  Regular unemployment benefits are paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states. However, additional weeks of extended unemployment benefits are available during times of high unemployment. The unemployment extension legislation passed by Congress in February 2012 changed the way the tiers of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) are structured. A tier of unemployment is an extension of a certain amount of weeks of unemployment benefits. There are currently four tiers of unemployment benefits. Each tier provides extra weeks of unemployment in addition to basic state unemployment benefits.

        "ground_truth": [
            "I don't think there's much you can do. Losses from the sale of personal-use automobiles (used for pleasure, commuting, etc) are not deductible as capital losses.  See IRS Tax Topic 409, end of the first paragraph.  The expenses you incurred in owning and operating the car (insurance, fuel, maintenance, service plans, etc) are not deductible either. If you used it partly for business, then some of your expenses might be deductible; see IRS Tax Topic 510.  This includes depreciation (decline in value), but only according to a standard schedule; you don't generally just get to deduct the difference between your buying and selling price.  Also, you'd need to have records to verify your business use.  But anyway, these deductions would apply (or not) regardless of whether you sell the car. You don't get your sales tax refunded when you resell the vehicle.  That's why it's a sales tax, not a value-added tax.  Note, however, that if you do sell it, the sales tax on this new transaction will be the buyer's responsibility, not yours. You do have the option on your federal income tax return to deduct the state sales tax you paid when you bought the car; in fact, you can deduct all the sales taxes you paid in that year.  (If you have already filed your taxes for that year, you can go back and amend them.)  However, this takes the place of your state income tax deduction for the year; you can't deduct both.  See Tax Topic 503.  So this is only useful if your sales taxes for that year exceeded the state income tax you paid in that year.

After a few months, he hired someone to take the extra work he was receiving, and directed the more routine requests his employee.  He had a full-time job plus all the extra work he wanted.  Most people who hire him simply want someone they would trust in their home, and his service spread by word-of-mouth.  He also got to meet many people who liked him and were impressed by his work ethic, resulting in many good connections if he ever wanted to pursue other employment. My friend was an IT professional, the best support person at our tech-heavy firm, so he wasn't giving his time away.  He did enjoy doing it, and he did enjoy the extra money.  On an hourly basis, especially once he added the assistant, he was making more on the side than he did at his job.  However, I believe he did start lower than that. Good luck!",

If  you live in North America and based on the needs in your city, you can try out these ideas. Here is what one of my friend has done,  The family has two kids and the wife started a home day care as she was already taking care of two kids anyways. Of course, she had to be qualified and she took the relevant child care classes and got certified, which took six months. And she is managing 4 kids in addition to her two kids bringing in at least 2000$ per month in addition. And my friend started a part time property management business on the side, with one client. For example there is always work on real estate whether its going up or going down. You have to be involved locally to increase your knowledge on real estate. You can be a property manager for local real estate investors. If its going down, you can get involved in helping people sell and buy real estate. Be a connector, bring the buyers and sellers together.",

That excludes writing your own iPhone apps, for example, which would take long hours of development and much marketing (and luck) to be successful. Good luck and congrats.",

There are many part-time jobs you could obtain (fast food, retail, grocery), you could obtain a sales-job (cars, real estate, even working for a recruiting firm) where you could connect buyers and sellers.  If your need is $100/month, a part-time job on weekends would fill the gap. When I was trying to solve my budget problems a few years ago, I thought that I needed to increase my income.

        "answer": "The dividend payout date for mutual funds is determined by the fund company and is typically announced in advance. Most mutual funds distribute their earnings, including dividends and capital gains, to their shareholders annually in December. The specific date and the estimated amount are usually made public in late October or November. However, mutual funds may update the estimated amounts as time gets closer, but the payout date generally does not change. It is also important to note that some funds distribute dividends more frequently, such as on the last business day of each month or quarterly for certain index funds, and capital gains may be distributed once a year.\n\nTo find out the exact dividend payout dates for a specific mutual fund, you can:\n\n1. Check the fund company's website for information about the fund's distributions. Look for a section on the website that provides distribution information, which could be labeled as \"Distributions\" or something similar.\n   \n2. Check the fund's distribution history, which can give clues about the pattern and timing of past distributions.\n   \n3. Contact your broker or the fund company directly if the information is not readily available on the website. However, note that fund companies sometimes are reluctant to divulge the exact distribution date until it has been made public by the fund manager .",

On \"\"distribution\"\" vs. \"\"dividend\"\": When a mutual fund spins off periodic cash, it is generally not called a \"\"dividend\"\", but rather a \"\"distribution\"\". The terminology is different because a distribution can be made up of more than one kind of payout. Dividends are just one kind. Capital gains, interest, and return of capital are other kinds of cash that can be distributed. While cash is cash, the nature of each varies for tax purposes and so they are classified differently.\"",
            "\"Mutual funds generally make distributions once a year in December with the exact date (and the estimated amount) usually being made public in late October or November.

Some funds (e.g. S&P 500 index funds) distribute dividends towards the end of each quarter or on the last business day of the quarter, and capital gains once a year as per the general statement above.

        "answer": "If you have an old building and are looking to make money from it, here are some options you might consider:\n\n1. **Sell the building**: You may choose to sell the building, but keep in mind that it may require repairs to make it habitable and appealing to potential buyers. In some cases, if the cost of repairs is too high, you might not recover your costs through the sale. An alternative could be to demolish a very decrepit building and sell the land itself, which might yield a better net profit .\n\n2. **Rent it out**: If the building is in a state where it's still habitable, renting it could be a viable option. However, if the building is uninhabitable, you would likely need to conduct repairs before you can rent it out, which may or may not align with your financial plans .\n\n3. **Commercial zoning**: If your building is in a less restricted zone, you could apply to have it re-zoned for commercial use. You then have the choice to run a business from it or to rent it out to other businesses. This, of course, assumes that the location is suitable for business and that the building itself is in a condition to be used commercially .\n\n4. **Mortgage**: You could consider taking out a mortgage on the building to get temporary cash flow. This would depend on the bank's valuation of the property, which could be low if the building is not in good shape. If you have a solid plan, you might use the mortgage cash to conduct repairs and increase the property's value for a future sale .\n\nEach of these options comes with its own set of considerations and potential complications. Factor in the state of the building, the local market, potential investment costs, and the timeline in which you'd like to see returns before making a decision.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "There are a few ways to get money from property, but I'm not sure any would work for you: 1) Firstly you could sell it. Selling the building might require enough repairs that the building is habitable; if the repair costs are too high, you might not be able to recover costs from selling. For a particularly old and unkempt building, this is more likely to be the case. In extreme scenarios, you may earn more net profit by demolishing a decrepit building, and simply selling the land. Make sure you aren't setting your price too high if you are desperate to sell; dropping your price might make the headache of upkeep go away, and might be better for you financially in the long run. 2) You could rent it - but if it is so uninhabitable you can't sell it, then this is unlikely without repairs (and it seems you don't want to do this anyway). 3) If your building is in an area where the zoning laws are not strict, you may be able to apply for a permit to have it zoned for commercial use - and either run a business out of it, or rent it to someone else to do so. Again, this would be dependent on repairs if the building is uninhabitable, and also would require the building to well-situated for a business. 4) You could take out a mortgage on the building. Of course, this has two big caveats: (a) the bank would need to assess the building for value [and it seems not to be worth much in your case]; and (b) this provides only temporary cash, which you would need to pay back to the bank over time. In some cases, if you had a solid plan, you might be able to take a mortgage out against the value of the land, and use the cash from the mortgage to do some repairs, so that it would be in good shape for selling."

        "question": "Should I pay more than 20% down on a home?",
        "answer": "When considering whether to pay more than 20% down on a home, there are several factors to take into consideration. Paying more than 20% can reduce the amount of money you borrow, resulting in less interest paid over the life of the loan. It also gives you more equity in the home immediately, which can be beneficial if you need to sell quickly. Additionally, putting down more than 20% can help you avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is a requirement if you make a lower down payment and protects the lender in case you default on your loan .\n\nHowever, it's important to consider your overall financial situation. You should ensure that you are debt-free and have an emergency fund set up before considering a higher down payment. Liquidity is also a critical factor; having funds available for emergencies or other investments can be more beneficial, especially when the economy is uncertain. This flexibility might outweigh the benefits of a larger down payment, particularly if the house needs repairs or if you have other high-interest debt that needs to be paid off .\n\nAdditionally, your life situation, such as marital status, retirement savings, and other debts, plays a role in this decision. Some people stick with a 20% down payment and then assess their financial situation as time goes on. This allows them to have a safety net while still actively paying down the mortgage when they are financially able to do so .\n\nThe decision also can be influenced by whether you anticipate a deflationary or inflationary future, which can affect the wisdom of paying off debt sooner or investing the money elsewhere for a potentially higher return .\n\nIn summary, while paying more than 20% down can bring several benefits, including reducing the life-time interest costs and avoiding PMI, it is also important to balance these benefits against the need for financial flexibility and liquidity. It is advisable to consider your personal circumstances, debt situation, and broader financial goals before making the decision  .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The more you put down now, the less money you are borrowing.  30yrs of interest adds up. Even paying a small amount at the beginning of the mortgage can turn into a huge savings over the life of the loan. That's why you'll find advice to make extra mortgage payments in the beginning.  The question is: Do you have a better use for that money?   In particular, do you have any higher-interest debt (higher APR than your mortgage) that needs to be paid off?  You generally want to take care of those first.   Beyond that can you invest the extra down payment money elsewhere (eg stock market) and get a better return than your mortgage rate?  (don't forget about taxes on investment profits). If so, that money will do more good there.",
            "One big factor that no one has mentioned yet is whether you believe in a deflationary or inflationary future. Right now, we are leaning towards a deflationary environment so it makes sense to pay off more of the debt. (If you make just one extra payment a year, you will have paid off your house 7 years early). However, should this change (depending on government and central bank policy) you may be better off putting down the very minimum.  In a year or three from now, you should have a clearer picture. In the meanwhile, here is a recent Business Week article discussing both sides of the argument. http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_28/b4186004424615.htm",
            "First of all, realize that buying a home isn't really an investment.  It is cheaper to rent.  In recent years, people were able to sell their houses for astronomical profits, but that won't be happening much in the future.  Additionally, there are many hidden costs of owning a home. Regarding the mortgage interest tax deduction, don't buy a house just to get this.  It is like spending $1 to get back some amount of money less than $1.  So just keep that in mind. Are you debt free?  If not, pay off your other debts before buying a home.  I follow the advice of Dave Ramsey, so I'll echo it here.  Make sure you have an emergency fund and no debt. At this point I think you are ready to buy a house.  When you do, put down as much as you can; above 20% if possible.  Then get a 15 year fixed rate mortgage. At this point, start saving for your kid's college (if you believe in that) and paying down your home. Having no mortgage is a dream many people never have.  I cannot wait until I have no mortgage.  Don't get suckered into getting a high priced loan.  Pay down as much of the price of the house as possible up front.  This gives you flexibility too.  What if you need to sell quickly?  Well, you will have equity from the get-go, so this will be much easier. Good luck with your purchase!",
            "The primary reason to put 20% down on your home is to avoid paying PMI (private mortgage insurance).  Anyone who buys a house with a down-payment of under 20% is required to pay for this insurance (which protects the lender in case you default on your loan). PMI is what enables people to buy homes with as little as 3-5% down. I would recommend against paying more than 20%, because having liquidity for emergency funds, or other investments will give you the sort of flexibility that's good to have when the economy isn't so great.  Depending on whether the house you purchase is move-in ready or a fixer-upper, having funds set aside for repairs is a good idea as well.",
            "I'd stick with 20% down. Truth is - we don't know enough about you. Are you single and staying that way? How is your retirement savings doing? As others asked, any other debt? You can put 20% down, take a breath and see how it's going. I did just that, the 20%. We then had a baby, and 5 nanny-years to pay for. When she was gone, all that money went to the mortgage, and after refinancing (with no points no closing) we have 7 years to go. Just under 20 years beginning to end. During that time we've saved for college (just about fully funded) and for retirement (both with matched 401(k) accounts).  Remember, if you lose your job, a house with a lower mortgage means nothing when there's still the next payment due. But that cushion of cash can be handy.",
            "Leverage increase returns, but also risks, ie, the least you can pay, the greater the opportunity to profit, but also the greater the chance you will be underwater. Leverage is given by the value of your asset (the house) over the equity you put down. So, for example, if the house is worth 100k and you put down 20k, then the leverage is 5 (another way to look at it is to see that the leverage is the inverse of the margin - or percentage down payment - so 1/0.20 = 5). The return on your investment will be magnified by the amount of your leverage. Suppose the value of your house goes up by 10%. Had you paid your house in full, your return would be 10%, or 10k/100k. However, if you had borrowed 80 dollars and your leverage was 5, as above, a 10% increase in the value of your house means you made a profit of 10k on a 20k investment, a return of 50%, or 10k/20k*100. As I said, your return was magnified by the amount of your leverage, that is, 10% return on the asset times your leverage of 5 = 50%. This is because all the profit of the house price appreciation goes to you, as the value of your debt does not depend on the value of the house. What you borrowed from the bank remains the same, regardless of whether the price of the house changed. The problem is that the amplification mechanism also works in reverse. If the price of the house falls by 10%, it means now you only have 10k equity. If the price falls enough your equity is wiped out and you are underwater, giving you an incentive to default on your loan. In summary, borrowing tends to be a really good deal: heads you win, tails the bank loses (or as happened in the US, the taxpayer loses).",

        "answer": "To cash out a check internationally, you can cash U.S. checks in almost any reputable bank around the world, but there are some important points to take into consideration:\n\n1. **Time for clearance**: It may take approximately 2-3 weeks for the check to clear when cashing it at a foreign bank .\n  \n2. **Fees involved**: There could be fees associated with cashing a U.S. check at a foreign bank. You should inquire with the bank beforehand to understand the charges you might incur .\n\n3. **Endorsement and deposit**: If you have a friend or someone you trust in the U.S., they might be able to deposit the check into a U.S. bank account in your name. Otherwise, you can endorse the check to someone, who can then deposit it into their account or cash it for you. Following this, they can transfer the money to you in a variety of ways .\n\n4. **Bank policies**: Different banks have different policies for handling foreign checks. Some U.S. banks may not accept deposits from someone who is not an account owner. Therefore, depositing the check directly into your own bank account in the country where you live could be the simplest option .\n\n5. **Access to funds**: When depositing a foreign check into your local bank account, there could be a significant delay before you can access the money. The check needs to clear the banking system, which can take time .\n\nIf the check represents a prize or some form of income earned in the U.S., you would need to file a tax return with the IRS and pay the appropriate taxes. Taxes can often be paid online if you possess a credit card, and if you haven't paid taxes for that particular year, you should make an estimated tax payment rather than waiting until the tax filing deadline .\n\nFinally, it\u2019s always a good idea to check with your local bank and the issuing bank for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding international check cashing as policies and regulations may vary by bank and by country.",

Since the amount is won in the US, how would I pay the taxes? , since   its earned over there. You would file a tax return with the IRS and send them a payment. You can buy drafts in US dollars almost anywhere in the world.",
            "\"Your friend probably cannot deposit the check to your U.S. bank account. U.S. banks that I've worked with will not accept a deposit from someone who is not an owner of the account. I don't know why not. If some stranger wants to make unauthorized deposits to my account, why should I object? But that's the common rule.  You could endorse the check, your friend could then deposit it to his own account or cash it, and then transfer the money to you in a variety of ways.  But I think it would be easier to just deposit the check in your account wherever it is you live. Most banks have no problem with depositing a foreign check. There may be a fairly long delay before you can get access to the money while the check clears through the system.  I don't know exactly what you mean by a \"\"prize check\"\", but assuming that this is taxable income, yes, I assume the U.S. government would want their hard-earned share of your money. These days you can pay U.S. taxes on-line if you have a credit card. If you have not already paid U.S. taxes for the year, you should make an \"\"estimated payment\"\". i.e. you can't wait until April 15 of the next year, you have to pay most or all of the taxes you will owe in the calendar year you earned it.\"",
            "This question was asked three years ago, but now that it's 2017 there is actually a relatively easy, cheap and fast solution to at least the first half of your question. To cash the check: I've done this a half dozen times while abroad (from the US) without any problems.",
            "I've been a landlord and also a tenant. I have been able to deposit money in an account, where I have the account number, and/or a deposit slip. In a foreign bank you can deposit by a machine if in the bank or someone is there for you and knows the account number. With regards to cashing a check in another country, it is up to the bank and the time is at least 14 to 21 business days, with a fee is added. As of a winning check, since its in your name, if you are in another country sign the check, for deposit only with a deposit slip and send it to your out of country bank by FedEx - you will have a tracking number, where as regular mail it might get there in 3 months. I hope by now you came to your solution."

        "question": "I have around 60K $. Thinking about investing in Oil, how to proceed?",
        "answer": "If you're considering investing in oil with your $60,000, here are some options and considerations:\n\n1. **Oil Company Stocks**: Investing in oil company stocks can be profitable since these companies tend to make record profits when oil prices are high, due to the relatively inelastic direct demand for oil. However, not all oil-related companies will react the same to changes in oil prices, and this requires detailed analysis .\n\n2. **ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**: ETFs that focus on the energy sector, such as the XLE in the US, can give you exposure to the performance of the sector without having to pick individual stocks. ETFs allow diversification and are easily traded like stocks . However, it's essential to be cautious with ETFs directly tied to the oil price, as they can be complex and risky, especially for novice investors .\n\n3. **Diversification**: Avoid putting all your money into a single industry or product. Diversifying your portfolio to include other industries or asset types is a common recommendation. For example, you could invest in low-cost index funds that track the overall performance of the stock market .\n\n4. **Royalty Trusts**: These are investments in a portfolio of mineral rights. They do not involve operations like oil companies but are instead a direct play on oil prices. It is advisable to research any publicly traded royalty trusts as potential investment opportunities .\n\n5. **Research and Analysis**: Do your homework before investing. This can involve fundamental analysis to determine which oil-related assets to buy and technical analysis to determine when to buy them. Make sure to have a plan and risk management strategy in place .\n\n6. **Risk Management**: Understand the risks involved with oil investments. For example, oil producers and consumers hedge against price fluctuations, and when you invest in oil, you assume their risk .\n\nIn conclusion, before proceeding:\n\n- Do your research thoroughly and understand the specifics of the oil market.\n- Consider diversification to manage risk.\n- Look into ETFs as a way to invest in the oil sector without pinpoint concentration.\n- Educate yourself on different investment strategies and risk management.\n\nGiven the complexity and volatility of the oil market, you might also consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Investing in any commodity, including oil, carries risks, and it's important to be prepared for the possibility of losing money as well as making a profit.",

            "One possibility would be to invest in a crude oil ETF (or maybe technically they're an ETP), which should be easily accessible through any stock trading platform.  In theory, the value of these investments is directly tied to the oil price.  There's a list of such ETFs and some comments here.  But see also here about some of the problems with such things in practice, and some other products aiming to avoid those issues.  Personally I find the idea of putting all my savings into such a vehicle absolutely horrifying; I wouldn't contemplate having more than a small percentage of a much more well diversified portfolio invested in something like that myself, and IMHO it's a completely unsuitable investment for a novice investor.  I strongly suggest you read up on topics like portfolio construction and asset allocation (nice introductory article here and here, although maybe UK oriented; US SEC has some dry info here) before proceeding further and putting your savings at risk.",
            "\"This is only a partial answer to your question #1. If you have a conservative approach to savings (and, actually, even if you don't), you should not invest all of your money in any single industry or product.  If you want to invest some money in oil, okay, but don't overdo it. If your larger goal is to invest the money in a manner that is less risky but still more lucrative than a savings account, you should read up on personal finance and investing to get a sense of what options are available.  A commonly-recommended option is to invest in low-cost index funds that mirror the performance of the stock market as a whole.  The question of \"\"how should I invest\"\" is very broad, but you can find lots of starting points in other questions on this site, by googling, or by visiting your local library.\"",
            "If you've decided to ignore the sound advice re: oil company stocks, and you want something directly linked to the price of oil, do the following: Understand that oil producers would like avoid the risk of a price drop, and oil consumers (refiners, electric utilities, etc.) would like to avoid the risk of a price rise. Understand that you are about to assume their risk.",
            "Royalty trusts track oil prices (they're a pure play on ownership of a portfolio of mineral rights and do not otherwise have the operations that the oil companies themselves have).  Many publicly traded ones listed at the embedded wikipedia link.   Oil tankers are having a bang up business right now as described in the article, but that's because of the low prices and flood of product from the middle east.  The article notes that inventories are near capacity, so terminals and pipelines may be in for a few good years, though these do not directly track oil price.  However, as a way to bet on oil or oil services, many terminals and pipelines are organized as publicly traded master limited partnerships or MLPs, often spun out of a major oil company for tax reasons, allowing fine-grained investment in specific assets."

        "answer": "Buying apartment houses and renting them out has several merits, as outlined in the document provided:\n\n1. Investment Growth: The value of your property may appreciate over time, which can result in a gain when you decide to sell the apartment house .\n\n2. Rental Income: You have the potential to generate monthly income from renting out your properties. This income can help cover the mortgage and expenses, and can be saved or reinvested in additional properties .\n\n3. Tax Deductions: You can benefit from tax deductions related to capital expenditures, such as mortgages, as well as expenses for upkeep, maintenance, and management of the property .\n\n4. Control Over Investments: Being a landlord gives you a level of direct control over your investment that you may not have with other types of investments. You can make decisions on property maintenance, tenant selection, and rent pricing .\n\n5. Potential for Diversification: Investing in multiple properties can spread your risk and potentially provide you with several streams of income .\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the responsibilities and challenges that come with being a landlord, including maintenance, managing tenants, and the potential for vacancies. Additionally, local market conditions and laws can significantly impact the viability and profitability of renting out properties  .",

            "Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) have different end of term dates but by less than a month.  Both have summer sessions, but most students do not stay over the summer.  You can rent over the summer, but prices fall by a lot.  Thirty to forty thousand students leave over the summer between the two.  Only ten to twenty thousand remain throughout the year and not all of those are in Oakland (the neighborhood in Pittsburgh where the universities are located).  So many of the landlords in Oakland have the same problem.  Your competitors will cut their rates to try to get some rent for the summer months.   This also means that you have to handle eight, nine, and three month leases rather than year long and certainly not multiyear leases.  You're right that you don't have to buy the latest appliances or the best finishes, but you still have to replace broken windows and doors.  Also, the appliances and plumbing need to mostly work.  The furnace needs to produce heat and distribute it.  If there is mold or mildew, you will have to take care of it.  You can't rely on the students doing so.  So you have to thoroughly clean the premises between tenants.   Students may leave over winter break.  If there are problems, the pipes may freeze and burst, etc.  Since they're not there, they won't let you know when things break.   Students drop out during the term and move out.  You probably won't be able to replace them when that happens.  If you have three people in two bedrooms, two of them may be in a romantic relationship.  Romantic relationships among twenty-year olds end frequently.  Your three people drops back to two.  Your recourse in that case is to evict the remaining tenants and sue for breach of contract.  But if you do that, you may not replace the tenants until a new term starts.  Better might be to sue the one who left and accept the lower rent from the other two.  But you likely won't get the entire rent amount for the remainder of the lease.  Suing an impoverished student is not the road to riches.   Pittsburgh is expected to have a 6.1% increase in house prices which almost all of it is going to be pure profit. I don't know specifically about Pittsburgh, but in the national market, housing prices are about where they were in 2004.  Prices were flat to increasing from 2004 to 2007 and then fell sharply from 2007 to 2009, were flat to decreasing from 2009 to 2012, and have increased the last few years.  Price to rent ratios are as high now as in 2003 and higher than they were the twenty years before that.  Maybe prices do increase.  Or maybe we hit a new 20% decrease.  I would not rely on this for profit.  It's great if you get it, but unreliable.   I wouldn't rely on estimates for middle class homes to apply to what are essentially slum apartments.  A 6% average may be a 15% increase in one place and a 3% decrease in another.  The nice homes with the new appliances and the fancy finishes may get the 15% increase.  The rundown houses in a block where students party past 2 AM may get no increase.   Both the city of Pittsburgh and the county of Allegheny charge property taxes.  Schools and libraries charge separate taxes.  The city provides a worksheet that estimates $2860 in taxes on a $125,000 property.  It doesn't sound like you would be eligible for homestead or senior tax relief.  Realtors should be able to tell you the current assessment and taxes on the properties that they are selling you.   You should be able to call a local insurance agent to find out what kinds of insurance are available to landlords.  There is also renter's insurance which is paid by the tenant.  Some landlords require that tenants show proof of insurance before renting.  Not sure how common that is in student housing.",
            "I\u2019m not an expert on the VISA/US tax or insurance, but you're making enough mistakes in terms of all the associated costs involved in owning and renting houses/apartments that this already looks potentially unwise at this stage of your investment career. Renting cheap properties/to students involves the property constantly being trashed, often being empty and requiring extremely close management (which you either have to pay someone a lot to do, or do yourself and lose other potential earning time. If doing yourself you will also make lots of mistakes in the vetting/managing/marketing process etc at first as this is a complex art in itself).  Costs on this type of rental can often get as high as 25% a year depending exactly how lucky you get even if you do it all yourself, and will typically be in the 5-15% range every year once everything you have to constantly maintain, replace and redecorate is totalled up. That's all pre what you could be earning in a job etc, so if you could earn a decent clip elsewhere in the same time also have to deduct that lost potential. Send it all to third parties (so all upkeep by hired contractors, all renting by an agency) you will be lucky to even break even off ~15k a year per property rents to students. You\u2019re not seeming to price in any transaction costs, which usually run at ~5% a time for both entrance and exit. Thats between half and one years rent gone from the ten per property on these numbers. Sell before ten is up its even more. On point three, rounding projections in house price rises to one decimal place is total gibberish \u2013 no one who actually has experience investing their own money well ever makes or relies on claims like this. No idea on Pittsburgh market but sound projections of likely asset changes is always a ranged and imprecise figure that cannot (and shouldn\u2019t) be counted on for much. Even if it was, it\u2019s also completely unattainable in property because you have to spend so much money on upkeep: post costs and changes in size/standard, house values generally roughly track inflation. Have a look at this chart and play around with some reasonable yearly upkeep numbers and you will see what I mean. Renting property is an absolute graveyard for inexperienced investors and if you don't know the stuff above already (and it's less than 10% of what you need to know to do this profitably vs other uses of your time), you will nearly always be better off investing the money in more passive investments like diversified bonds, REITs and Stock.",
            "I am not going to argue the merits of investing in real estate (I am a fan I think it is a great idea when done right).  I will assume you have done your due diligence and your numbers are correct, so let's go through your questions point by point. What would be the type of taxes I should expect?  NONE. You are a real estate investor and the US government loves you. Everything is tax deductible and odds are your investment properties will actually manage to shelter some of your W2(day job) income and you will pay less taxes on that too.  Obviously I am exaggerating slightly find a CPA (certified public accountant) that is familiar with real estate, but here are a few examples. I am not a tax professional but hopefully this gives you an idea of what sort of tax benifits you can expect.   How is Insurance cost calculated?  Best advice I have call a few insurance firms and ask them.  You will need landlord insurance make sure you are covered if a tenant gets hurt or burns down your property. You can expect to pay 15%-20% more for landlord insurance than regular insurance (100$/month is not a bad number to just plug in when running numbers its probably high).  Also your lease should require tenants to have renters insurance to help protect you. Have a liability conversation with a lawyer and think about LLCs.   How is the house price increase going to act as another source of income?  Appreciation can be another source of income but it is not really that useful in your scenario.  It is not liquid you will not realize it until you sell the property and then you have to pay capital gains and depreciation recapture on it.  There are methods to get access to the gains on the property without paying taxes.  This is done by leveraging the property, you get the equity but it is not counted as capital gains since you have to pay it back a mortgage or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) are examples of this.  I am not recommending these just making sure you are aware of your options. Please let me know if I am calculating anything wrong but my projection for one year is about $8.4k per house (assuming no maintenance is needed) I would say you estimated profit is on the high side.  Not being involved in your market it will be a wild guess but I would expect you to realize cash-flow per house per year of closer to $7,000.  Maybe even lower given your inexperience.  Some Costs you need to remember to account for: Taxes, Insurance, Vacancy, Repairs, CapEx, Property Management, Utilities, Lawn Care, Snow Removal, HOA Fees. All-in-all expect 50% or your rental income to be spent on the property.  If you do well you can be pleasantly surprised.",
            "Insurance - get estimate from an insurance agent who works with policies for commercial real estate.  See comments below regarding incorporation. Taxes - if this was basic income for a simple LLC, estimating 25-40% and adjusting over time might work.  Rental property is a whole different prospect.  Financial experts who specialize in rental properties would be a good source of advice, and worth the cost.  See below regarding incorporating. Real estate appreciation - not something you can count on for developed property.  Appreciation used to be almost guaranteed to at least keep up with inflation.  Now property values are not even guaranteed to go up.  Never have been but the general rule was improved real estate in good repair appreciated in price.  Even if property values increase over time, rental properties depreciate.  In fact, for rental properties, you can claim a certain rate of depreciation over time as an expense on taxes.  This depreciation could mean selling for less than you paid for the property after a number of years, and owing capital gains taxes, since you would owe the difference between the depreciated value and the sale price. Related to taxes are local codes.  Some areas require you to have a property management license to handle buildings with more than a certain number of units. If you are going to own rental properties, you should protect your private financial life by incorporating.  Form a company.  The company will own the property and hire any maintenance people or property managers or security staff or any similar employment activities.  The company takes out the insurance and pays taxes.  The company can pay you a salary.  So, bottom line, you can have the company pay all the expenses and take all the risks.  Then, assuming there's any money left after expenses, the company can pay you a manager's salary.  That way if the worst happens and a tenant breaks their hip in the shower and sues you for ONE MILLION DOLLARS and wins, the company folds and you walk away.  You might even consider two companies.  One to own the property and lease it to a property management company.  The property management company can then go bankrupt in case of some sort of liability issue, in which case you still keep the property, form a new management company, repaint and rename the property and move on. TL;DR:  Get insurance advice from insurance agent before you buy.  Same for taxes from an accountant.  Get trained as a property manager if your local codes require it (might be a good idea anyway).  Incorporate and have the company take all the risks.",
            "Hitting the 25% marginal rate does not mean all of your earnings are taxed at 25%, only those that exceed the top of the 15% bracket. You can deduct any expenses for upgrading or repairing your apartments, those are subtracted from the earnings before tax is calculated as income, so you will probably stay in a lower marginal rate. Property tax will hit you annually, and capital gains tax will hit you when you sell them at the end. If you already have experience with this business in your home country, then this sounds like a good option for you. The only caution that I would give you is to find an accountant to help you with your taxes and pay for a consultation before you get started so that you know what to track that will help him/her minimize your tax bill."

        "answer": "A young student should consider several options for investing money:\n\n1. **Invest in Knowledge**: First and foremost, a young investor should invest in their financial education since understanding how money works is crucial. This doesn't require capital but a commitment to learn. Reading books and following companies in a virtual portfolio can help to gain experience without risking actual money .\n\n2. **Retirement Accounts**: It can be beneficial to put some money into a retirement savings account for long-term growth, taking advantage of compound interest over many decades . Specifically, a Roth IRA is recommended because contributions to a Roth IRA can grow tax-free and may significantly increase in value over time. There\u2019s also the possibility to contribute $5,500 for the previous tax year and an additional $5,500 for the current year if taxes for the prior year have not yet been filed .\n\n3. **Diversified Investments**: Investing in diversified assets, such as stocks, for the long term is another strategy. Services like \"Motley Fool Stock Advisor\" are suggested for recommendations on which stocks to invest in each month, investing small amounts at a time .\n\n4. **Inflation-Protected Securities**: For safeguarding against inflation, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or i-Bonds can be a good choice. These provide a fixed interest rate plus a variable rate based on current inflation, ensuring the investment keeps up with inflation .\n\n5. **Build an Emergency Fund**: For the short term, establishing an emergency fund is important. This can be done by saving a portion of income to cover around six months of living expenses .\n\n6. **Plan with a Financial Planner**: Consulting an independent financial planner who charges by the hour rather than one who earns through commissions is recommended to get unbiased advice on how to allocate the investments .\n\n7. **Stay Cautious with High-Risk Investments**: Young investors can be more risk-tolerant than older investors, but it\u2019s essential to understand one's comfort level with risk, as investing will have ups and downs .\n\nIt's crucial to balance these options considering both short-term and long-term goals, factoring in necessary liquidity for goals like buying a car or a house, or starting a family.

Self-employment taxes are based on your net self-employment income after deducting business expenses . \n\n2. **Medicare and Social Security Tax**: You will owe SE Medicare tax at a rate of 2.9% on all your SE net income (adjusted down by 7.65% to account for employer's share if you were a W-2 employee), and SE Social Security tax at a rate of 12.4% on your adjusted SE net income up to a certain cap .\n\n3. **Additional Medicare Tax**: If your income exceeds certain thresholds ($200,000 for single filers, $250,000 for joint filers), you may owe an Additional Medicare Tax of 0.9% on the excess .\n\n4. **Tax Payments**: You are supposed to pay at least 90% of your tax liability during the year through estimated tax payments or withholding from any W-2 employment you may have .\n\n5. **Business Expenses**: As an independent contractor, you can deduct certain business expenses directly from your income, effectively lowering your taxable income .\n\n6. **Federal Income Tax**: In addition to self-employment tax, you will also owe regular income tax on your earnings. You'll generally file income taxes using Form 1040, along with Schedule SE, and, if applicable, Schedules C, E, F, or others depending on the nature of your business .\n\nPlease note these points are based on general guidelines, and specific situations can vary. It is advisable to consult a tax professional for personalized advice, especially considering that tax laws change over time and you'll want to ensure compliance with the current laws.",

You need to fill out the statement of business activity form and keep detailed records of all your deductible expenses. Make photocopies and keep them 7 years.

        "question": "Should I give to charity by check or credit card?",
        "answer": "The decision on whether to give to charity by check or credit card depends largely on the amount you're donating and the charity's preference. Here's some extracted information from the document that might help you decide:\n\n- For donations ranging from $1 up to about a hundred dollars, the fees for processing credit card transactions (about 3% or 3.5%) are comparable to the added staff time and processing involved with handling checks. Thus, for smaller donations, either method is about the same in terms of cost to the charity .\n\n- However, when you're giving a couple of hundred dollars, and especially in the thousands, it is generally better to donate by check. This is because most banks don't charge extra deposit fees at the scale of most nonprofits, and the handling of checks may align with regular bank runs already made by the charity's staff .\n\n- It's important to note that if the majority of a charity's donations are received through online credit card or PayPal payments, then handling checks could be more expensive for them. Therefore, it could be less costly for the charity if you donated in the way that the majority of their donations are usually made .\n\n- A definitive approach for larger amounts of money is to ask the charity which method they prefer and which is less costly for them. A simple communication with the charity could ensure that neither their time nor the donation is wasted .\n\n- For very large donations to tax-exempt organizations in the U.S., consider giving appreciated equities like stocks, bonds, or mutual fund shares. This could be more tax-efficient for both you and the charity, as you can claim a deduction and avoid capital gains tax, which the charity doesn't have to pay if they are exempt .\n\n- Finally, for advancing the efficiency of the donation landscape, consider electronic methods like ACH (Automated Clearing House) transfers, as many businesses and organizations are moving away from checks, which can be costly and inefficient for charities .\n\nBased on this information, for small donations, either method seems to be acceptable. For larger donations, checks are probably more cost-effective, unless the charity receives most donations electronically. For very large donations, contacting the charity to ask for their preferred method or consider other forms of donation like appreciated equities, is advisable. Always ensure that the charity benefits as much as possible from your donation while minimizing costs on their end.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "As someone that has run a nonprofit, my 2 cents: First: thank you for giving and for being conscientious about wanting to make things as easy as possible. The best method is the one you'll actually do. If there is a chance that you will end up not donating by check because you don't have a stamp, you forget, etc. go ahead and do it online. A donation with a fee is better than an intention without one. We had one case where a potential donor decided to give, but was so worried about the processing fee that they wanted to write a check. We followed up 3 times on the pledge, spent time following up with the pledge's connection that wanted to see if it came through, and in the end they never sent the check. Their pledge wound up costing us staff time and money as we tried to make their giving easy.  If you are as likely to give, size matters. My rule of thumb is that if you are giving $1 up to about a hundred dollars, the fee (which most nonprofits can get to about 3% or 3.5%) is about the same as the added staff time opening the check, adding an extra to the deposit slip, etc. But as soon as you are giving a couple hundred dollars and especially if you are giving in the thousands, it is definitely better to do it by check. Most banks don't charge an extra deposit fee at the scale of most nonprofits, and we probably have some run to the bank happening in the next day or two. Really your thank you note should be the same whether online or by check (even though you'll get the auto-thank you online), so that time difference shouldn't really play into it. The donation will be appreciated either way.  While I cringe a bit if I see a $1,500 donation come through online knowing that the check would be cheaper, that is far outweighed by the thankfulness that someone thought of us and made it happen.",
            "This kind of questions keeps repeating itself on this site and the answer is generally it doesn't matter. As you said yourself, there are costs either way, and these costs are comparable. Generally, merchant fees differ tremendously between the different kinds of merchants, and while gas stations and video rentals may pay up to 5% and even more, charitable organizations and community services are usually not considered as high fraud risk operation and are charged much lower fees. Either way, paying employees, managing cash/check deposits or paying merchant fees is part of the charity operational expenses. Together with maintaining offices, postal office boxes, office supplies, postage expenses and formal stationary and envelopes needed for physical donations handling. I would guess that if the charity's majority of donations come on-line as credit card/paypal payments - check handling will be more expensive. So I suggest you take the route you consider majority of donors pay - that would be the cheapest for them to handle. I would guess, credit cards being the most convenient - would be the way to go.",
            "\"The definite answer if you want to give a larger amount of money is: Ask the charity. Just drop them a mail with something like: Dear Sirs, I've decided to donate you $1,000,000 because I like what you do. Could you please tell me which option is more convenient and less costly for you? I can do either an online debit/credit card payment, send you a check by mail, or make a bank transfer [cross out whichever you can't do]. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Even if you give \"\"just\"\" $2,000, it's surely enough to be worth for them writing you a reply and clarifying whichever way they prefer, so you don't waste neither their time nor the money this way.\"",
            "In the US, if it's a large donation to a tax-exempt organization (401c3 or equivalent), you may want to consider giving appreciated equities (stocks, bonds, mutual fund shares which are now worth more than you paid for them).  You get to claim the deduction's value at the time you transfer it to their account, and you avoid capital gains tax.  They would pay the capital-gains tax when they redeem it for cash... but if exempt, they get the full value and the tax is completely avoided.  Effectively,  your donation costs you less for the same impact.  It does take a bit of work to coordinate this with the receiving organization, and there may be brokerage fees, so it probably isn't worth doing for small sums.)Transfers within the same brokerage house may avoid those feee.) So again, you should talk to the charity about what's best. But for larger donations, where larger probably starts at a few thou, it can save you a nice chunk of change.",
            "This might be blasphemy in the context of an audience that may be most focused on the gift itself, but you should be donating in a manner that helps advance the landscape, as well as your particular favourite charity. Almost 90% of businesses are in the process of trying to move away from issuing and receiving checks, and several countries in the world have already stopped using them. Checks are inefficient, costly and in a resource constrained environment like that facing most charities, create an opportunity cost that is even higher than the manual processing cost that flows directly.  As donors, we need to think about scale in a manner that many individual charities don't.  Send your donation via ACH!"

        "answer": "When an unmarried couple with joint ownership of a home decides to split up, there are several considerations and steps that may be taken to resolve the shared property aspect of their separation. The document outlines a strategy involving the division of property into personal, his, hers, and shared categories. Each party would then be responsible for their personal costs and half of the shared costs. When it comes to shared infrastructure or maintenance, a trusted individual should be employed to carry out repairs, and costs, including the time spent, should be appropriately divided between the two parties.\n\nMoreover, the document suggests setting up a mechanism for a buyout offer or the sale of one party's share to the other or a third party. Consulting a lawyer to formalize this agreement is strongly recommended, to make expectations and responsibilities clear, including defining an exit strategy if one party wants out. Conducting this partnership as a simple business is advised, where all rent income goes into a separate account from which the mortgage and other expenses are paid, and any profits are split.\n\nThe complexity of the situation is acknowledged, and as such, it\u2019s essential for both parties to agree on all expenses and operations, potentially with the help of a financial professional to handle accounting and taxes properly. In cases where one of the owners might also be maintaining the property, they would act as a contractor and be paid from the business income, subject to both owners agreeing on the terms.\n\nUltimately, the document emphasizes that the fairest and most straightforward resolution for both parties is to aim for a clean split with no joint property ownership, tailored to the unique circumstances of the individuals involved .",

        "question": "Should I prioritize retirement savings inside of my HSA?",
        "answer": "When considering whether to prioritize retirement savings inside of your Health Savings Account (HSA), it's important to understand how HSAs work and their intended purpose. An HSA is specifically designed to cover current and future medical expenses, and it offers tax advantages when used for qualifying healthcare costs. However, it's also suggested that, while you should fund your HSA for reasonable and expected medical expenses, you should prioritize funding retirement through Roth IRAs or 401(k) over an HSA for extra retirement savings. This is due to the lack of flexibility and fees associated with HSAs. The guidance points out that Roth accounts are particularly advantageous because the money grows tax-free, is not subject to Required Minimum Distribution provisions, and avoids estate escrow when going to one's beneficiaries .\n\nIt's also noted that you would want to prioritize Roth and retirement over HSA because, aside from health and dental expenses, an HSA does not cover other life aspects such as travel to specialists, hotel stays, home alterations, special vehicles, or lifestyle alterations, which may be associated with an illness or disability. Therefore, while funding an HSA is wise for health-related expenses, for broader financial planning and retirement purposes, Roth IRAs and 401(k)s are considered better to prioritize for long-term savings .\n\nThis should not be taken as a comprehensive financial plan but rather a perspective on how to approach your savings strategy. It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to fit your savings and investment strategies with your personal financial situation and goals.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Unquestionably I think the priority should be funding retirement through ROTH/IRA/401K over HSA extra.  Obviously you need to fund your HSA for reasonable and expected medical expenses.  Also there is some floor to your more traditional retirement funding. Beyond that what does one do with excess dollars?  Given the lack of flexibility and fees, it seems clear to do ROTH IRA and 401K. Beyond that what then?  You may want to decide to \"\"take some money home\"\" and pay taxes on it.  Do you have a desire to own rental property or start/purchase a business?  Upgrade your home? etc... If all those things are taken care of, only then would I put money into an HSA. YMMV but most people, maxing a ROTH IRA alone, will have plenty of money for retirement given a reasonable rate of return.\"",
            "\"You would want to prioritize Roth and retirement over HSA. As the HSA is only for health and dental expenses, which you will always have, overfunding it will put you in a bit of a pickle for all of the life involved. For example, even if you or a loved one develop a strange & expensive ailment, the HSA will only cover the medical costs, but not any travel to specialists, hotel stays, home alterations, special vehicles, or lifestyle alterations (food, clothing). However, you will eventually stop working even if you are healthy throughout your life.  I would suggest that you treat the HSA as a part of your overall emergency fund, giving it a cap the same as you would normal non-retirement savings. Since you stated you have three young children, small and large medical expenses (such as braces, trips to the emergency room) are something that are almost guaranteed, thus having fairly large amount in the HSA would be very beneficial throughout their time with you. Once the children have left however, if you still have an overwhelming balance in your HSA, you may not want to add anymore to the HSA. Setting a cap for the HSA based off a certain number of years of deductible payments for medication would be a good place to start.  Roth accounts, whether it be within your company's 401k plan or the IRAs for yourself and your spouse, are single-handedly the best location for your money for long-term savings. Roth money grows tax-free, is immune to Required Minimum Distribution provisions, and will avoid estate escrow when going to one's beneficiaries. Even if you tap into the funds prior to age 59 1/2, you would only pay taxes on any investment growth, in addition to the 10% early withdrawal penalty. If you have established Roth IRA accounts and have an AGI that disallows you to further contribute to them, there is still a provision to get Roth funds contributed via conversion through what is commonly called a \"\"back door\"\" Roth.\""

Here are some options based on the information from the document provided:\n\n1. **529 Plans**: These are education savings plans operated by a state or educational institution designed specifically for saving for future college costs. They offer high contribution limits (around $300,000) and possible state tax deductions. However, if the child doesn't attend college, there may be a 10% penalty on withdrawals .\n\n2. **Prepaid Tuition Plans**: These allow you to prepay the costs of a state college education, but usually require the child to attend a school in the state where the plan is purchased. Withdrawal penalties may apply if the child attends school out of state, and these plans may not offer great returns anymore .\n\n3. **Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)**: Also known as Coverdell ESAs, allow for contributions of up to $2,000 per year with more investment flexibility compared to 529 plans. However, the contribution limit is much lower .\n\n4. **Traditional and Roth IRAs**: Typically used for retirement savings, they can also be utilized to pay for higher education. This might not be the recommended route, but offers flexibility if you've already maximized contributions to other retirement savings accounts .\n\n5. **Regular Brokerage Accounts**: This option provides flexibility but could yield lower returns after taxes. If financial aid eligibility is a concern, funds can potentially be moved to investments that don't affect financial aid calculations closer to the college entry date .\n\n6. **Direct Stock Investment**: For longer-term savings where money is not needed until a future date, such as 2025, buying stocks and gradually switching to safer options as the need for funds approaches can be a strategy. This method might not have specific educational benefits but provides investment growth potential .\n\nA key piece of advice from the document emphasizes prioritizing retirement saving before saving for a child's college education. It's important to remember that while students can take loans for education, there are no loans for retirement .\n\nRemember to tailor the choice of savings strategy to your financial situation, your expectations for your child's future education, and your state's specific laws regarding educational savings plans.

            "Saving for college you have a couple of options.  529 plans are probably the best bet for most people wanting to save for their kids college education. You can put a lot of money away ~$300k and you may get a state tax deduction. The downside is if you're kid doesn't go to college you may end up eating the 10% penalty. State specific prepaid tuition plans. The upside is you know roughly the return you are going to get on your money. The downside is your kid has to go to a state school in the state you prepaid or there are likely withdrawal penalties. For the most part these really aren't that great of a deal any more.  ESAs are also an option but they only allow you to contribute $2k/year, but you have more investment options than with the 529 plans. Traditional and ROTH IRA accounts can also be used to pay for higher education. I wouldn't recommend this route in general but if you maxed out your 401k and weren't using your IRA contribution limits you could put extra money here and get more or really different flexibility than you can with a 529 account. I doubt IRA's will ever be asked for on a FAFSA which might be helpful. Another option is to save the money in a regular brokerage account. You would have more flexibility, but lower returns after taxes. One advantage to this route is if you think your kid might be borderline for financial aid a year or two before he starts college you could move this money into another investment that doesn't matter for financial aid purposes. A few words of caution, make sure you save for retirement before saving for your kids college.

        "answer": "Getting a mortgage with bad credit is challenging, but having a high income can improve your odds, especially if you can offer a significant down payment and can show a reliable payment history. Here are some points that may be relevant to your situation:\n\n1. **FHA Loans**: If you have limited credit, an FHA loan might be suitable because you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580 and they only require 3.5% down. However, it's important to note that getting new lines of credit can affect your credit score negatively in the short term because of hard inquiries and the impact of having new credit accounts .\n\n2. **Manual Underwriting**: Look for institutions that conduct manual underwriting rather than automated credit checks. This approach allows the lenders to consider individual financial situations, such as a high income or a large down payment, which can work in your favor .\n\n3. **Non-Corporate Creditors**: Banks are often constrained by regulations and may not finance higher-risk loans, but you could find individual investors through mortgage investment clubs or religious institutions who may be more flexible if you're willing to pay higher interest rates .\n\n4. **Saving a Large Down Payment**: Demonstrating the ability to save a substantial down payment could make a difference. A history of saving and offering 25% or more down may improve your chances of securing a mortgage .\n\n5. **Be Honest with Challenges**: When seeking a mortgage, being upfront about your credit situation and explaining your high income and potential down payment can be crucial in finding a lender willing to work with you .\n\n6. **Extra Costs of Owning a Home**: Remember that owning a home comes with additional expenses beyond the mortgage, like property tax, insurance, PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), and maintenance, which can affect affordability, especially if you are paying more interest due to your credit history .\n\nIf you are considering pursuing a mortgage with your current financial profile, it would be advisable to research the options, possibly explore the assistance of a financial advisor, and prepare to present your financial situation in the best light to potential lenders.",

You'll also be paying more interest than normal given your recent credit history. It's still possible that buying is better than renting, but one really should run the detailed math on this.

These are properties they foreclosed on and depending how they are carrying them, you might find decent opportunities. As a matter of logic, a local bank that owns these specific properties (as compared to debt pools where big banks have piles of paper owned fractionally) are more willing to get a new owner in and paying a new loan.

        "answer": "Investments that are positively related to a housing market decline and could potentially benefit from it include:\n\n1. Safe-haven assets such as gold and U.S. treasuries, which tend to be sought after by investors during economic uncertainty and when real estate markets are faltering .\n2. Discount retailers like Wal-Mart and Dollar General, as during tough economic times, people tend to prioritize spending on necessities and look for cheaper options, which benefits these retailers .\n3. Real estate brokerage firms could potentially profit from fluctuations in the housing market irrespective of housing prices if they are able to maintain or increase sales volume .\n4. Other services related to real estate such as real estate information and marketing websites (e.g., Trulia.com) could also benefit from changes in the housing market .\n\nAdditionally, shorting stocks of builders or companies that stand to lose if the housing market declines can also make your investment higher as a result of the security going lower . However, it's crucial to approach these investments with caution due to their inherent risks and market volatility.",

Although a brokerage commission is linked to the sale prices it is more directly impacted by sales volume.

If sales volume does go up another option would be other service markets for real estate such as real estate information and marketing websites and sources i.e. http://www.trulia.com. Furthermore one can go and make a broad generalization such as since real estate no longer requires the same quantity of construction material other industries sensitive to the price of those commodities should technically have a lower cost of doing business. But be careful in the US much of the wealth an average american has is in their home. In this case this means that the economy as a whole takes a dive due to consumer uncertainty.

            "\"During the actual decline, there's very little money to be made and a lot to lose. When housing prices tank, everybody loses; the banks are exposed to higher risk of mortgage defaults, insurers start having to pay out more for \"\"gas leaks\"\" claiming over-leveraged homes,    realtors starve because their commissions go down (even as foreclosures put more homes on the market) and people faced with financial uncertainty will stay put in their current homes instead of moving elsewhere. And homebuilders and contractors go broke because nobody wants to spend cash on a new home or major reno that looks like a losing investment. There can be some bright spots. Smaller hardware stores will make money as people do relatively small DIY projects to improve the condition of their current home. The larger stores get this business too, but it tends to be more than offset by the loss of contractor business (FAR more lucrative, and something the ACEs and True-Values don't really get in on). Of course the \"\"grave-robbers\"\" do well; gold buyers, auctioneers, pawn shops, repo firms; these guys eat well when other people are defaulting on loans or have to sell their stuff for fast cash. Most of these businesses are not publicly traded. One thing that was seen was increased revenues at discount retailers like Wal-Mart, Dollar General etc. When things are bad, people in the middle class who had avoided these stores for image or morality reasons learn to swallow their pride and buy discount store brands for half the price of national brand names. That lessens the blow felt by the discount retailers as overall consumer spending decreases; the pie shrinks, but the discount retailers get a bigger slice of the mandatory spending on food, clothing, etc (and the higher-level retailers get it in the shorts). When the pie starts to grow again as consumer spending picks back up, the discount retailers retain their percentage for a while, as the fickle middle class can afford to buy more from the discount retailer but can't yet afford to take their business back to the shopping mall stores. This produces a flatter, \"\"offset\"\" price graph for discount retailers through the business cycle; they don't lose as early or as much as everyone else in a major downturn, and they turn it around sooner while everyone else may still be on the way down, but as everything gets better for everyone on the upswing it's less great for the discount guys, as they start losing customers and their dollars to competitors with better stuff, even as the ones they keep spend more. This doesn't generally manifest as a true negative correlation, but it can be a good hedge. The number one money-making investment in a tanking economy is gold. When things go down the crapper, everyone wants gold, so if you see the train wreck coming far enough in advance, you can make a big move to gold and really make some money off that investment. For instance, when the first whispers about ARM adjustments and mass defaults reached the public consciousness in mid-2005, gold bullion jumped from about $400 to over $700 in a nine-month period. It cooled off again in 06-07 but only to about $600/oz, and then in late 07 it steadily climbed to peak at $1000/oz; even if you got in late, an investment of $1000 in July '07 in \"\"bulk\"\" gold would have netted you $650 in one year; that's a 65% APY. Then the economy hit bottom and a lot of investors ditched gold for investments they thought would pull back out of their holes quickly; For just a little while in '08 gold was down to $700 again. Then came all the government reports; unemployment not budging, home prices still declining, a lot of banks still hiding just how bad their position was. If you had seen that it was going to be bad, bad, bad, like a lot of now-billionaire hedge fund investors did, a $1000 investment in gold in July 05, and then cashing out at the tops of the peaks and buying back in at the major troughs, would be worth almost $4000 today. That's a 400% return over 7 years, or an annual average yield of 57%. There simply hasn't been anything like that in the last 7 years.\""

        "question": "Tax consequences of changing state residency?",
        "answer": "Changing your state residency can have various tax consequences, and the impact largely depends on the tax laws of the states involved. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Income Earned Before and After Moving: When you move from one state to another and also change your work location, all income earned before the date you establish residency in the new state is considered income for your old state (State 1). All income on or after that date is considered income for your new state (State 2). It's important to clearly establish your new residency if there is a significant difference in income or tax rates between the two states .\n\n2. Tax Rates and Residency: If you move from a state with high taxes to a state with low taxes, you should take steps to establish your residency in the new state by registering your vehicles, registering to vote, and getting a new driver's license. The move can impact your tax situation and your financial planning .\n\n3. Work Location vs. Residency: If you move your home to a new state but continue to work in your previous state, the question of where you pay tax can become more complex. Some states may base taxation on where you live, while others may base it on where you work. Reciprocity agreements between states can also influence this. For example, Virginia, Maryland, and DC have an agreement that taxes are paid based on where you live for residents among these states. However, if you live in Delaware and work in Virginia, Virginia will tax that income. Therefore, research on reciprocity agreements for the specific states involved is crucial before moving .\n\n4. Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Taxation: Some states, such as Massachusetts, allow part-year residents to claim a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. However, nonresidents cannot claim this credit. If you move to a new state but continue to work in Massachusetts, for instance, you would still owe Massachusetts income tax for that income even after establishing residency in the new state. The credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions is limited to the smaller of Massachusetts income tax on the income reported to the other jurisdiction or the actual tax paid to that jurisdiction .\n\n5. Part-Year Resident Tax Forms: If you move mid-year, you may need to file a part-year resident tax form for the year of the move. For example, if you move from New Hampshire to Massachusetts, you would need to file a Form 1-NR/PY for that year, reporting income as a part-year resident of Massachusetts .\n\nThese are general guidelines, and specific tax situations can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances and the states involved. It's always advisable to consult with a tax professional for personalized advice when considering a change in state residency.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "It also depends on where you work. If you move your home and your job then the date you establish residency in the new state is the key date. All income before that date is considered income for state 1, and all income on or after that date is income for state 2.  If there is a big  difference in income you will want to clearly establish residency because it impacts your wallet. If they had the same rates moving wouldn't impact your wallet, but it would impact each state. So make sure when going from high tax state to low tax state that you register your vehicles, register to vote, get a new drivers license... It becomes more complex if you move your home but not your job. In that case where you work might be the deciding factor. Same states have agreed that where you live is the deciding factor; in other cases it is not. For Virginia, Maryland, and DC you pay based on where you live if the two states involved are DC, MD, VA. But if you Live in Delaware and work in Virginia Virginia wants a cut of your income tax.  So before you move you need to research reciprocity for the two states. From Massachusetts information for Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Income, Exemptions, Deductions and Credits Massachusetts gross income includes items of income derived from   sources within Massachusetts. This includes income: a few questions later: Massachusetts residents and part-year residents are allowed a credit   for taxes due to any other jurisdiction. The credit is available only   on income reported and taxed on a Massachusetts return. Nonresidents   may not claim the taxes paid to other jurisdiction credit on their   Massachusetts Form 1-NR/PY. The credit is allowed for income taxes paid to: The credit is not allowed for: taxes paid to the U.S. government or a   foreign country other than Canada; city or local tax; and interest and   penalty paid to another jurisdiction. The computation is based on comparing the Massachusetts income tax on   income reported to the other jurisdiction to the actual tax paid to   the other jurisdiction; the credit is limited to the smaller of these   two numbers. The other jurisdiction credit is a line item on the tax form but you   must calculate it on the worksheet in the instruction booklet and also   enter the credit information on the Schedule OJC. So if you move your house to New Hampshire, but continue to work in Massachusetts you will owe income tax to Massachusetts  for that income even after you move and establish residency in New Hampshire.",
            "I did the reverse several years ago, moving from NH to MA. You will need to file Form 1-NR/PY for 2017, reporting MA income as a part-year residence. I assume you will need to report the April capital gain on your MA tax return, as you incurred the gain while a MA resident. (I am not a lawyer or tax professional, so I don't want to state anything about this as a fact, but I would be very surprised if moving after you incurred the gain would have any affect on where you report it.)"

        "question": "Can increasing my tax withholding from my full-time job cover FICA taxes for my freelance work?",
        "answer": "Yes, increasing your tax withholding from your full-time job can help cover the amount owed for self-employment taxes from your freelance work. When you are self-employed, you are responsible for paying self-employment taxes, which serve a similar purpose to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes paid by employees and employers for Social Security and Medicare. Self-employment taxes are mandated under the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) and have equivalent rates to FICA taxes, combining both the employer and employee portions .\n\nTo cover these self-employment taxes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows you to either make quarterly estimated tax payments or increase the withholding on your W-2 job to cover the expected tax liability from your freelance work. You are supposed to pay at least 90% of your tax liability during the year through increased withholding or quarterly estimated payments. If this is your first year of having to pay self-employment tax, you may qualify for a 'safe harbor' exception and avoid an underpayment penalty if your withholding covers at least 100% of your tax liability from the previous year, provided your income was not over $150,000 . \n\nIt's important to make sure your combined payments\u2014through withholding or estimated payments\u2014cover both your income tax and your self-employment tax liabilities. Keep in mind that self-employment tax includes 12.4% for Social Security on your net income up to a certain threshold, which adjusts yearly based on inflation, and 2.9% for Medicare tax on all your net income with no limit .\n\nPlease make sure to consult with a tax professional for advice tailored to your specific situation, as tax laws can change and personal circumstances can influence the best approach to take.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Technically you owe 'self-employment' taxes not FICA taxes because they are imposed under a different law, SECA. However, since SE taxes are by design exactly the same rates as combining the two halves of FICA (employer and employee) it is quite reasonable to treat them as equivalent. SE taxes (and income tax also) are based on your net self-employment income, after deducting business expenses (but not non-business items like your home mortgage, dependent exemptions, etc which factor only into income tax). You owe SE Medicare tax 2.9% on all your SE net income (unless it is under $400) adjusted down by 7.65% to compensate for the fact that the employer half of FICA is excluded from gross income before the employee half is computed. You owe SE Social Security tax 12.4% on your adjusted SE net income unless and until the total income subject to FICA+SECA, i.e. your W-2 wages plus your adjusted SE net income, exceeds a cap that varies with inflation and is $127,200 for 2017. OTOH if FICA+SECA income exceeds $200k single or $250k joint you owe Additional Medicare tax 0.9% on the excess; if your W-2 income (alone) exceeds this limit your employer should withhold for it. However the Additional Medicare tax is part of 'Obamacare' (PPACA) which the new President and Republican majorities have said they will 'repeal and replace'; whether any such replacement will affect this for TY 2017 is at best uncertain at this point. Yes SE taxes are added to income tax on your 1040 with schedule SE attached (and schedule C/CEZ, E, F as applicable to your business) (virtually so if you file electronically) and paid together. You are supposed to pay at least 90% during the year by having withholding increased on your W-2 job, or by making 'quarterly' estimated payments (IRS quarters are not exactly quarters, but close), or any combination. But if this is your first year (which you don't say, but someone who had gone through this before probably wouldn't ask) you may get away with not paying during the year as normally required; specifically, if your W-2 withholding is not enough to cover your increased taxes for this year (because of the additional income and SE taxes) but it is enough to cover your tax for the previous year and your AGI that year wasn't over $150k, then there is a 'safe harbor' and you won't owe any form-2210 penalty -- although you must keep enough money on hand to pay the tax by April 15. But for your second year and onwards, your previous year now includes SE amounts and this doesn't help. Similar/related:"

        "question": "How to calculate my estimated taxes. 1099 MISC + Self Employment",
        "answer": "To calculate your estimated taxes when you have a 1099 MISC and are self-employed, you should consider both your federal income tax and self-employment tax liabilities. Here's a simplified breakdown of the steps you should follow:\n\n1. **Calculate your net self-employment income**: Subtract any business-related expenses from your gross income to find your net self-employment income.\n\n2. **Estimate your annual income**: This amount will be your adjusted annual income, which can be determined by adding your self-employment net income to any other sources of income, and then subtracting any deductions or credits you expect to claim.\n\n3. **Calculate self-employment tax**: The self-employment tax rate is 15.3%, representing both the employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes (12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare). You can calculate the annual self-employment tax by applying this rate to your net self-employment income.\n\n4. **Calculate federal income tax**: Apply the appropriate tax rates to your estimated taxable income (adjusted income minus deductions and exemptions) to determine your federal income tax liability.\n\n5. **Calculate quarterly taxes**: Divide both the self-employment tax and federal income tax amounts by four to find your quarterly estimated payments.\n\n6. **Make payments using Form 1040-ES**: Send your combined quarterly payments (federal income tax and self-employment tax) using Form 1040-ES.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n- Don't forget to account for a personal exemption and a standard deduction if you're not itemizing deductions. For tax years prior to 2018, the personal exemption was $4,050 and the standard deduction was $6,300 for single filers, making the combined total $10,350 .\n\n- Consider using tools like an IRS-provided spreadsheet or tax software to help with these calculations. For example, the spreadsheet version of IRS form 1040 provided by a private individual might calculate the self-employment tax as well as income tax when you input your information on Schedule C .\n\nRemember that this information is general advice and based on guidelines that could be outdated. For the most accurate and up-to-date calculations, you should refer to the current year's tax forms and instructions or consult with a tax professional. If you're in doubt or have specific circumstances that could affect your tax calculation, seeking professional advice is always the best option.",

            "There is a shortcut you can use when calculating federal estimated taxes.  Some states may allow the same type of estimation, but I know at least one (my own--Illinois) that does not. The shortcut: you can completely base your estimated taxes for this year on last year's tax return and avoid any underpayment penalty.  A quick summary can be found here (emphasis mine): If your prior year Adjusted Gross Income was $150,000 or less, then   you can avoid a penalty if you pay either 90 percent of this year's   income tax liability or 100 percent of your income tax liability from   last year (dividing what you paid last year into four quarterly   payments). This rule helps if you have a big spike in income one year,   say, because you sell an investment for a huge gain or win the   lottery. If wage withholding for the year equals the amount of tax you   owed in the previous year, then you wouldn't need to pay estimated   taxes, no matter how much extra tax you owe on your windfall. Note that this does not mean you will not owe money when you file your return next April; this shortcut ensures that you pay at least the minimum allowed to avoid penalty. You can see this for yourself by filling out the worksheet on form 1040ES.  Line 14a is what your expected tax this year will be, based on your estimated income.  Line 14b is your total tax from last year, possibly with some other modifications.  Line 14c then asks you to take the lesser of the two numbers.  So even if your expected tax this year is one million dollars, you can still base your estimated payments on last year's tax.",

As a practical matter, so long as you don't owe $1000 or more when you file your actual tax return, they aren't going to care.  So just make sure that your total payments match by the payment you make January 15th.   I'm not going to try to calculate for the state.  For one thing, I don't know if your state uses Q1i or Q1pi as its base.  Different states may have different rules on that.  If you can't figure it out, just use Q1i, as that's the bigger one.  Fix it when you file your annual return.  The difference in withholding is going to be relatively small anyway, less than 1% of your income.",
            "\"There are a couple of things that are missing from your estimate. In addition to your standard deduction, you also have a personal exemption of $4050.  So \"\"D\"\" in your calculation should be $6300 + $4050 = $10,350. As a self-employed individual, you need to pay both the employee and employer side of the Social Security and Medicare taxes.  Instead of 6.2% + 1.45%, you need to pay (6.2% + 1.45%) * 2 = 15.3% self-employment tax. In addition, there are some problems with your calculation. Q1i (Quarter 1 estimated income) should be your adjusted annual income divided by 4, not 3 (A/4). Likewise, you should estimate your quarterly tax by estimating your income for the whole year, then dividing by 4.  So Aft (Annual estimated federal tax) should be: Quarterly estimated federal tax would be: Qft = Aft / 4 Annual estimated self-employment tax is: Ase = 15.3% * A with the quarterly self-employment tax being one-fourth of that: Qse = Ase / 4 Self employment tax gets added on to your federal income tax.

An advantage is that it is the full 1040, so you can also select the standard deduction and the number of exemptions you are entitled to, enter ordinary W-2 income, even capital gains, etc. Of course you can also make use of other tax software to do this, but in my experience the \"\"Excel 1040\"\" is more convenient, as most websites and tax-prep software tend to be structured in a linear fashion and are more cumbersome to update in an ad-hoc way for purposes like tax estimation.

        "question": "Should I make extra payments to my under water mortgage or increase my savings?",
        "answer": "The decision between making extra payments on an underwater mortgage or increasing your savings depends on several factors, including the specifics of your financial situation, your investment goals, and your tolerance for risk.\n\nThe information found suggests that by making extra semi-monthly payments of $100 each, you could pay off your mortgage in 23 years instead of 30. This would save you a significant amount on interest over the life of the loan, reduce the time you're in debt, and free up cash flow sooner for other investments or expenses .\n\nHowever, there are also arguments for why you might want to increase your savings instead:\n\n1. Liquidity: By increasing your savings, you have more liquid assets available to you, which can be useful in case of emergencies or opportunities that require quick access to cash.\n\n2. Investment Return: If you can invest your savings in something that yields a higher return than the interest rate of your mortgage, your savings can potentially grow faster than the amount you would save on interest by paying down the mortgage early.\n\n3. Tax Considerations: In some nations, such as the United States, mortgage interest is tax-deductible, which could affect the net benefit of paying off the mortgage sooner.\n\nUltimately, the decision also depends on your comfort level with debt, your other financial commitments, and future financial goals. It could be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide guidance based on a comprehensive review of your financial situation.\n\nIn making this decision, take into account that the greatest savings from making extra mortgage payments occur at the beginning of the mortgage term. If you've already been paying your mortgage for a while, the leverage obtained from pre-paying will be less than it would have been at the start . Additionally, you should consider the stability of your income, whether you can sustain higher payments without hardship, and how prepared you are to handle life's unexpected expenses.\n\nSome strategies, like making one extra payment entirely to the principal at the beginning of each year on a 30-year mortgage, have been suggested to significantly reduce the amortization period and overall interest paid. However, the actual amount saved and the benefits of such strategies will vary depending on individual circumstances.\n\nGiven these points, both options have their merits and potential drawbacks.

Or you might be so deep underwater by then that the extra money doesn't make much of a difference anymore anyway.

Personally i would want the bank to take as much of that loss as possible, rather than myself.  Depending on the locale the mortgage may or may not be non-recourse, ie the loan contract implies that the bank can take the house from you if you default, but if 'non-recourse' the bank has no legal way to demand more money from you.

Note that even if not 'non-recourse', it's not clear it would be worth the banks time and money to pursue any shortfall after a sale or if you just walk away and mail the keys to the bank. If you're not worried about your credit, the most financially beneficial action for you might be to simply stop paying the mortgage at all and bank the whole payments.  It will take the bank some time to get you out of the house and you can live cost-free during that time. You may feel a moral obligation to the bank.  I would not feel this way.  The banks and bankers took a ton of money out of selling mortgages to buyers and then selling securities based on the mortgages to investors.  They looted the whole system and pushed prices up greatly in the process, which burned most home buyers and home owners.  It's all about business -my advice is to act like a business does and minimize your costs.  The bank should have required a big enough downpayment to cover their risk.  If they did not, then they are to blame for any loss they incur.  This is the most basic rule of finance."

For conversions, the IRA permits a recharacterization, basically, a do-over, which reverses the conversion, any or all, in case you have any reason it should not have been done. That has a deadline of 10/15, i.e. 4/15 plus 6 month extension. The 401(k) conversion has no such provision. Simple answer 12/31 of the given year.",
            "\"the deadline for roth conversions is december 31st.  more precisely, roth conversions are considered to have happened in the tax year the distribution was taken. this creates a kind of loop hole for people who do an ira rollover (not a trustee-to-trustee transfer). technically, you can take money out of your traditional ira on december 31st and hold it for 60 days before deciding to roll it over into either another traditional ira or a roth ira. if you decide to put it in another traditional account, it is not a taxable event.  but if you decide to put it in a roth account, the \"\"conversion\"\" is considered to have happened in december. unfortunately non-trustee rollovers are tricky. for one, the source trustee will probably take withholding that you will have to make up with non-ira funds. and rollovers are limitted to a certain number per year. also, if you miss the 60-day deadline, you will have to pay an early-withdrawal penalty (with some exceptions). if you really want to push the envelope, you could try to do this with a 60-day-rule extension, but i wouldn't try it. source: https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/ch01.html oddly, recharacterizations (basically reverse roth conversions) have a deadline of october 15th of the year after the original roth conversion it is reversing. so, you could do the conversion in december, then you have up to 10 months to change your mind and \"\"undo\"\" the conversion with a \"\"recharacterization\"\". again, this is tricky business. at the very least, you should be aware that the tax calculations for recharacterization are different if you convert the funds into a new empty roth account vs an existing roth account with a previous balance. honestly, if you want to get into the recharacterization business, you can probably save more on taxes by converting in january before 20-month stock market climb rather than simply converting in the year your tax brackets are low. that is the typical recharacterization strategy. source: https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-IRAs-Recharacterization-of-Roth-Rollovers-and-Conversions\""

        "question": "Am I considered in debt if I pay a mortgage?",
        "answer": "Yes, if you have a mortgage, you are considered to be in debt. A mortgage is a type of debt where someone lends you money to buy a house, which you are then obligated to pay back, so you have debt. Mortgages are secured by the property, meaning the lender can take possession of the house if you fail to repay the loan. It is not uncommon for people to have debts like mortgages, and having a mortgage does not necessarily mean you have a negative net worth, especially if you have equity in the house and other assets .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"The statistic you cited comes from the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, a survey that they do every three years, most recently in 2013.  This was reported in the September 2014 issue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin.  They list the percentage of Americans with any type of debt as 74.5 in 2013, down slightly from 74.9 in 2010. The Bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have, and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list.  So the answer is yes, the 75% statistic includes Americans with home mortgages.* The bigger question is, are you really \"\"in debt\"\" if you have a home mortgage?  The answer to that is also yes.  When you take out a mortgage, you really do own the house.  You decide who lives there, you decide what changes you are going to make to it, and you are responsible for the upkeep.  But the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house.  This means that if you refuse to pay, the bank is allowed to take possession of the house.  They don't even get the \"\"whole\"\" house, though; they will sell it to recoup their losses, and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied. Is it good debt?  Many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset, the debt is acceptable.  With this definition, a car loan is bad, credit card debt is very bad, and a home mortgage might be okay.  Even Dave Ramsey, radio host and champion of the debt-free lifestyle, is not opposed to home mortgages.  Home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford. * Interestingly, according to the bulletin appendix, credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid, not including purchases made after the bill.  So people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered \"\"in debt\"\" in this statistic.\"",
            "\"I think you're thinking that \"\"in debt\"\" doesn't just mean \"\"owes a debt\"\" but somehow means \"\"owes more debt in total than the assets\"\". That condition, owing money without offsetting assets, is \"\"having a negative net worth\"\". If you have a mortgage then you have a debt and you are in debt. You may have a positive net worth, if you have equity in the house and your car and such like, and have cash in the bank. You may have a negative net worth if you owe more than you own. But either way you are technically in debt. Knowing that, it's not surprising that 75% of Americans are in debt. It's surprising that 25% are not. They have no credit card, no car loan, no mortgage, no line of credit, no student loans. Is it because they've paid all that off? Or because they are deadly poor and own nothing and can't be lent anything? You can't just say it's bad to have debt. It's bad to have too much debt, to have a negative net worth, to be in the habit of borrowing to finance a lifestyle you can't actually afford, and so on. But it's perfectly normal to have a debt or two. That's how our system mostly works.\"",
            "Yes.   A mortgage is a kind of debt.  Someone lends you money to buy your house, and you owe them the money, so you have debt.",
            "Yes, a mortgage is debt.  It's unique in that you have a house which should be worth far more than the mortgage. After the mortgage crisis, many found their homes under water i.e. worth less than the mortgage.  The word debt is a simple noun for money owed, it carries no judgement or negative connotation except when it's used to buy short lived items with money one doesn't have.  Aside from my mortgage, I get a monthly credit card bill which I pay in full. That's debt too, only it carried no interest and rewards me with 2% cash back. Many people would avoid this as it's still debt.",
            "If you owe money to someone else then you are in debt, at least in the common meaning of the word.  What you happen to own, or what you spent that money on doesn't alter that fact. Are people considered in debt if their only 'debt' is the mortgage/loan for their house, or are these people excluded from the statistic? The only way to answer that for sure is to look at who compiled the statistic and exactly what methodology they used.",
            "\"Mortgage is a (secured) debt, a combination of a promissory note, and a security interest providing the mortage holder a secured interest in the property. Yes, you are \"\"in debt\"\". But that depends upon whether you define the term \"\"in debt\"\" as a debt appearing on the balance sheet, or the net of assets - liabilities is less than zero, whether you have a \"\"debt\"\" expense on the income statement (budget), or whether the net of income - expenses is less than zero. One person might look at their budget, find the (monthly) mortgage payment listed, and judge that they have a debt payment, and thus are \"\"in debt\"\". Or they might look at their expenses, find they exceed their income, and judge that they are \"\"in debt\"\". Another person might look at their balance sheet, compare assets to liabilities, and only say they were \"\"in debt\"\" when their liabilities exceeded their assets. Some people view mortgage debt as \"\"good debt\"\", as they view certain debts as \"\"good\"\" and others as \"\"bad\"\". Trust me, having a high mortgage payment (higher 30% of your net income) is hard, and over 40% is bad. Consider you balance sheet and your income statement.  On your balance sheet, the house appears on the \"\"asset\"\" side with an (estimated) value, while the \"\"mortgage\"\" (really, the promissory note part of the mortgage) appears on the \"\"liability\"\" side. On your income statement, your house does not appear on the income side, but the mortgage (promissory note) payment appears on the expense side. So, you clearly have both a \"\"liability\"\" with a clearly-defined value and an \"\"expense\"\" with a clearly-defined payment. But do you have an \"\"asset\"\"? According to an accountant, you have an \"\"asset\"\" and a \"\"liability\"\". But you do not have a business asset that is producing revenue (income), nor do you have a business asset that can be amortized and expensed to reduce taxable income. When we think about an asset, does the word have the connotation of some thing with value, something that produces income?  Well, by that measure, a house only provides income when we rent it out, and only has value when we consider selling it. As millions of families discovered during the housing (price) collapse, when the market price of your \"\"asset\"\" falls substantially, your personal financial status can fall negative and you can be \"\"broke\"\".\"",
            "\"The expression \"\"in debt\"\" when talking about a person's financial affairs means that the sum of debit balances on all accounts exceeds the sum of credit balances on all accounts.    A mortgage account is not excluded from that. This definition also does not consider whether any of the debt is secured, or ownership of assets (shares, property, chattels, etc).   So, someone with a mortgage of one million dollars for a home that is worth two million is in debt by one million dollars, until they they sell the home (for that amount) and pay down the mortgage. That means \"\"in debt\"\" is not necessarily a statement about net worth.\""

        "question": "AVS Address Verification System of BOTH Credit and Debit Cards - WHERE, HOW?",
        "answer": "The Address Verification Service (AVS) is a system used in conjunction with zip code and billing address information to verify the address with the billing address on file with the issuing bank of a credit or debit card. AVS is used as a web or phone service and does not use the credit card's magnetic stripe. Instead, it relies on the information that the bank has on file to confirm transactions.\n\nAs per the document, the types of information stored on the credit card magnetic stripe may include the account number, name, expiration date, card-specific details, and a discretionary section. However, it generally does not include much in terms of address information. When a false zip code is provided, a purchase may be rejected, as the AVS system might not be able to match the provided information with that on file at the bank.\n\nFurthermore, AVS is utilized differently based on the transaction context. For example, zip codes entered at pay-at-the-pump gas stations for AVS are reportedly not used for marketing purposes, particularly under the regulation of certain states such as California, as long as the information is only used for AVS purposes .\n\nWhile AVS can verify numeric address parts such as address number, apartment number, and zipcode, American Express can also verify cardholder names. The capability to validate certain pieces of information will depend on what the individual issuing bank chooses to support since there is no master database of every cardholder. A \"verify-only\" transaction that returns AVS values without charging the card is supported by some processors but requires an \"approved merchant account\" . \n\nIn summary, AVS confirms the billing address information provided during a transaction with the cardholder's information on file with the bank. It helps prevent unauthorized use of a card and is also a measure against fraud.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Parts of what you want are possible, but taken as a whole, you're out of luck. First of all, there is no master database of every cardholder in the country.  The only way to check if information is correct is to ask the issuing bank.  The AVS system is a way to automate doing so, but it's possible to call the bank directly and verbally verify the address.   That means you're subject to the whims of what the issuing bank chooses to support.  Banks that are part of the Visa and MasterCard networks generally only verify the numeric parts (address, apartment number, zipcode).  AmEx can also verify the cardholder name.  But if the bank doesn't have support for validating something, you can't validate it. Separately, there is a \"\"verify-only\"\" transaction which some processors support, which will do exactly what you want:  Return AVS values without ever charging the card.  However, processors require you to have the \"\"approved merchant account\"\" you don't want to have to have.  Without being a merchant, you shouldn't have access to other people's credit cards anyway.  Would you really want anyone in the country to be able to verify anyone else's address whenever they want?

        "answer": "To live outside the rat race of American life with $300,000, there are several strategies you might consider. Based on the contents of the file provided, it appears that avoiding the traditional 9-to-5 and consumer debt can be key factors in stepping away from that cycle. Additionally, leveraging remote work opportunities can facilitate mobility and reduce the need to participate in the daily commute, which is often associated with the rat race.\n\nInvestment is highlighted as another strategy to consider. Investing your capital with a goal to generate income can help to sustain your livelihood without the need to engage in the rat race. It's suggested to invest as if you're managing a university endowment, aiming for long-term growth and accounting for inflation. By withdrawing a prudent percentage of your investment annually, such as 5-7%, which on $300,000 would equate to $15,000-$21,000, you may be able to cover living expenses, although these figures will need to be adjusted for taxes and inflation .\n\nAnother avenue mentioned is real estate. With $300,000, you could potentially purchase two or three single-family dwellings or invest in multifamily housing or commercial real estate to generate rental income. Ensuring that you have good property management will be essential to minimize effort and attention required on your part while maintaining a consistent income stream .\n\nThe documents also caution about the volatility of investments and the potential for financial loss, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and possibly consultation with a financial mentor who can guide you through the process .\n\nFinally, personal living choices, such as adopting a minimalist lifestyle or pursuing van life or narrowboat living, could allow you to live well within the potential income generated from your investments .\n\nKeep in mind that these are foundational ideas, and a detailed plan should be tailored to your personal situation, accounting for various factors such as your cost of living, healthcare needs, personal preferences, and risk tolerance. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a more precise and sustainable plan.",

            "\"So my read on the question is \"\"How do I invest 300k such that it earns me a 'living wage' without the ongoing grind inherent in most formal employment?\"\"  Reading the other answers to date it looks like most of them are thinking in terms of investment accounts and trying to live off of the earnings from such.  I wanted to throw out a couple of alternative choices that may be worth considering... The first is real-estate investing.  $300k should allow you to pick up 2 or 3 single family dwellings with little or no mortgage.  Turning them into rentals placed with a good property management company should easily pay their expenses and provide a consistent income with minimal effort/attention from you.  Similar story with buying into multifamily housing or commercial real-estate. Your key concern here is picking the right market in which to buy and finding a reputable manager to handle the day to day issues on your behalf. Note that you are not overly concerned with the potential resale value of the property(s), but the probable rental income they can generate, these are separate concerns that may not align with each other. Second is buying/founding a business that has a general manager other than yourself.  Franchise ownership may be a potential option for you under the circumstances.  The key concern here is picking the business, location, and manager that make you comfortable in terms of the risk involved.  You need the place to make enough money to pay for itself and the salary of everyone working there, with enough left over for you to live on.  Sounds easy enough, but not so much in practice.  Generally you can expect at least a few years of being hands on and watching things very closely to make sure it is going the way you want it to.  Finding a mentor who has done this type of transition before to walk you through it would be strongly advised.  So would preparing yourself for a failure or two before you work out the exact combination of factors that work for you.\"",
            "\"The title of your question is quite different then the content.  The term \"\"Rat Race\"\" was coined in the 70's and refers to the endless cycle of working hard to consume more.  Fortunately it is very easy not to participate in the cycle and probably will lead to more happiness.  Just because one \"\"works\"\" does not mean they are participating in the \"\"rat race\"\", and I would recommend the following: When I think of \"\"rat race\"\" I picture a a bumper-to-bumper freeway of people struggling to get to work.  For others it might be different, but that kind of rat race is easily avoided by the multitude of remote work opportunities.  Some jobs allow you to work anywhere in the world. Avoiding the rugged consumerism also helps avoid the feelings of being a rat on the wheel.  Sure one can like nice things, but do we have to have everything that Madison Ave is trying to sell us?  No.  Pick some nice things and pay cash. Debt, especially consumer debt, causes a person (in effect) to work for a bank.  Avoiding debt will remove those feelings. Saving and investing also helps avoid those feelings.  There is profound satisfaction in watching ones account balances grow.  Once you see that your investment earnings can outpace your expenses, and then your salary you really feel like you are getting ahead.      Above all else giving is a paramount and often overlooked part of a person's financial life.  It causes one to be humble and recognize that most people, in this world, are less fortunate that us.

            "\"An endowment is a large chunk of capital (i.e. money) held by  a university or other nonprofit.  It is meant to hold its value forever against inflation, and invested to generate income: from interest, dividends and appreciation.   They seem like a contradiction: closely scrutinized by Boards of Directors, managed to a high and accountable standard, closely regulated -- and yet, invested aggressively for growth: ignoring short-term volatility to get the highest growth long-term.  The law, UPMIFA (P for Prudent), requires growth investment, and says taking up to 7% of current value per year is prudent, even in down times when total value is shrinking.  On average, this lets the endowment grow with inflation.  7% is the high end of \"\"prudent\"\".  An endowment is watched, and the taken income is adjusted to keep the endowment healthy. 5% is very safe, assuming the endowment must pace inflation until the heat death of the universe. If you plan to die someday, drawing an extra 1-2% is appropriate.  There you go.  Invest like a university endowment, and count on up to 7% per year of income.  That's $21,000 a year. There'll be taxes, but the long-term capital gain rate at $21,000/year is pretty low.  That's pretty tight, but possible if your idea of entertaining is Netflix.

            "Even with a good investment strategy, you cannot expect more than 8-10% per year in average. Reducing this by a 3% inflation ratio leaves you with 5 - 7%, which means 15k$ - 21k$. Consider seriously if you could live from that amount as annual income, longterm. If you think so, there is a second hurdle - the words in average. A good year could increase your capital a bit, but a bad year can devastate it, and you would not have the time to wait for the good years to average it out. For example, if your second year gives you a 10% loss, and you still draw 15k$ (and inflation eats another 3%), you have only 247k$ left effectively, and future years will have to go with 12k$ - 17k$. Imagine a second bad year. As a consequence, you either need to be prepared to go back to work in that situation (tough after being without job for years), or you can live on less to begin with: if you can make it on 10k$ to begin with (and do, even in good years), you have a pretty good chance to get through your life with it. Note that 'make it with x' always includes taxes, health care, etc. - nothing is free. I think it's possible, as people live on 10k$ a year. But you need to be sure you can trust yourself to stay within the limit and not give in and spent more - not easy for many people.",

        "answer": "The rules and guidelines for claiming mileage allowances in the context of commuting and transportation expenses are as follows:\n\n1. Commuting expenses between your home and your main or regular place of work are considered personal commuting expenses and are not deductible. This applies regardless of the distance from home to work or if you work during the commute .\n\n2. Regular W2 employees cannot deduct housing or transportation costs related to their employment. However, employers in the U.S. may offer Parking and/or Transit Flexible Spending Account (FSA) programs, known as Commuter Benefits FSA programs. These programs allow employees to defer up to $255 per month from their gross pay, tax-free, for parking and/or transit expenses, which include eligible expenses like bus and train passes or parking at a train or bus station. These contributions are subject to use-it or lose-it provisions and must be sponsored by the employer .\n\n3. For personal car commuters, the main category eligible for pretax deduction is for paying for parking. IRS guidelines list Qualified Transportation Benefits, which include a ride in a commuter highway vehicle between the employee's home and workplace, a transit pass, qualified parking, and qualified bicycle commuting reimbursement. It should be noted that the exclusion for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursement is not available in any month the employee receives any of the other qualified transportation benefits .\n\nWhen considering mileage allowances for business use of a personal vehicle, an employer-created Flexible Spending Account (FSA) can be used. Employees can contribute amounts to these accounts, with pre-tax income, deduct the contributions, and then withdraw the funds to cover their transportation expenses. This arrangement does not come through deductions on Schedule A but rather through the pretax income contributions to an FSA .\n\nPlease keep in mind that tax laws and guidelines can change, and it's always a good idea to consult with an accountant or refer to the official IRS guidelines for the most accurate and current information.",

            "The advice above is generally good, but the one catch I haven't seen addressed is which specific laws apply.  You said that you are in Arkansas, but the dealer is in Texas.  This means that the laws of at least two different states are in play, possibly three if the contract contains a clause stating that disputes will be handled in a certain jurisdiction, and you are going to have to do some research to figure out what actually applies.   One thing that may significantly impact this issue is whether you were in TX or AR when you signed the contracts.  If you borrowed the money in TX, and the lender is in TX, then it is almost certain that the laws of Texas will govern.  However, if you were living in AR at the time you acquired the loan, particularly if you were in AR when you signed the papers, you have a decent case for claiming that the laws of Arkansas govern.  I don't know enough about either state to know if one is more favorable to the consumer than the other, but it is a question you really want to have answered.  That said, I would be shocked if any state did not have provisions requiring the lender to provide a copy of the terms and a detailed statement of the account and transaction history upon request.  Spend some time on the web site of the Texas attorney general and/or legislator (because that is where the lender is, they are more likely to respect Texas law) to see if you can track down any specific laws or codes that you can reference.  You might also look into the federal consumer protection laws, though I can't think of one off hand that would apply in the scenario you have described.   Then work on putting together a letter asking them to provide a copy of the contract and a full history of the account.  As others noted, make sure you send it certified/return receipt, or better yet use a private carrier such as fedex, and check the box about requiring a signature. Above all you need to get the dialog transferred to a written form.  I can not stress this point enough.  Everything you tell them or ask for from here out needs to be done in a written format.  If they call you about anything, tell them you want to see their issue/offer in writing before you will consider it. You do not necessarily need a lawyer to do any of this, but you do need to know the applicable laws.  Do the research to know what your legal standing is.  Involve a lawyer if you feel you need to, but I have successfully battled several large utility companies and collection agencies into behaving without needing one.",

The bottom line is that you now know that you have the right to the details and to audit their recording of the transactions. You should now use that information and demand a better response in writing. If they have to give you a response in writing, they can't deny the answer they gave in a court of law later on. They understand this, and they will take you more seriously if you send a letter. Make sure to keep copies of the letter and send it with certified delivery."

        "question": "Tips for insurance coverage for one-man-teams",
        "answer": "Here are some tips for insurance coverage for one-man teams, based on the information provided in the document:\n\n1. Pay attention to tax considerations when evaluating health insurance premiums. If you are self-employed, note that health insurance premiums can be deducted on Line 29 of Form 1040 but only under certain conditions related to coverage eligibility through an employer or a spouse's employer. The ability to pay premiums with pre-tax dollars can affect the overall cost of insurance .\n\n2. Explore options provided by professional and trade associations, as some offer group insurance plans at discounted rates, akin to COBRA coverage, but without the employer subsidy on premiums. Membership in organizations such as IEEE or ACM, which cater to professionals such as software developers, could provide access to insurance forms among other benefits .\n\n3. Utilize resources such as credit unions, cooperatives, local chambers of commerce, and possibly faith-based non-insurance organizations that offer medical cost-sharing services to seek lower-cost insurance alternatives .\n\n4. Understand that health insurance is regulated at the state level, which influences the options available to you. You might find a list of insurance companies or insurance of last resort options on your state\u2019s official website .\n\nAlways consider your specific circumstances when determining the right insurance options for your one-man team. Factors such as your location, the nature of your self-employment, tax implications, and the benefits offered by different organizations will all play a part in finding suitable coverage.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "While the OP disses the health insurance coverage offered through his wife's employer as a complete rip-off, one advantage of such coverage is that, if set up right (by the employer), the premiums can be paid for through pre-tax dollars instead of post-tax dollars. On the other hand,  Health insurance premiums cannot be deducted on Schedule C by self-employed persons. So the self-employed person has to pay both the employer's share as well as the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes on that money. Health insurance premiums can be deducted on Line 29 of Form 1040 but only for those months during which the Schedule C filer is neither  covered nor eligible to be covered by a subsidized health insurance plan maintained by an employer of the self-employed person (whose self-employment might be a sideline) or the self-employed person's spouse. In other words, just having the plan coverage available through the wife's employment, even though one disdains taking it, is sufficient to make a Line 29 deduction impermissible.  So, AGI is increased. Health insurance premiums can be deducted on Schedule A but only to the extent that they (together with other medical costs) exceed 10% of AGI. For many people in good health, this means no deduction there either. Thus, when comparing the premiums of health insurance policies, one should pay some attention to the tax issues too. Health insurance  through a spouse's employment might not be that bad a deal after all.",
            "\"Like most forms of insurance, health insurance is regulated at the state level. So what is available to you will depend greatly upon which state you live in. You can probably find a list of insurance companies from your state's official website. Many states now provide \"\"insurance of last resort\"\" for individuals who can't get insurance through private insurance companies. You can try looking into professional and trade associations. Some offer group insurance plans comparable with COBRA coverage, meaning you'd get a group discount and benefits but without the benefit of an employer paying 30-80% of your premiums. As a software developer you may qualify for membership in the IEEE or ACM, which both offer several forms of insurance to members. The ASP also offers insurance, though they don't provide much information about it on the public portions of their website. These organization offer other benefits besides insurance so you may want to take that in to consideration. The National Federation of Independent Business also offers insurance to members. You may find other associations in your specific area. Credit Unions, Coops and the local chamber of commerce are all possible avenues of finding lower cost insurance options. If you are religious there are even some faith based non-insurance organizations that provide medical cost sharing services. They depend upon the generosity and sense of fairness and obligation of their members to share the burden of medical expenses so their definitely not for everyone.\""

        "question": "Vanguard ETF vs mutual fund",
        "answer": "Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds are both investment options offered by Vanguard, but they have different characteristics and benefits.\n\nVanguard ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds):\n- They trade like stocks and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at fluctuating market prices. \n- Vanguard ETFs are commission-free to Vanguard clients using Vanguard Brokerage Services. However, investors using other brokerage services may face commissions or other costs.\n- ETFs do not allow for auto-investment of a fixed dollar amount since you typically must buy whole shares, which could make regular investing a bit more challenging if you have a specific budget in mind.\n- Vanguard ETFs may serve as an alternative to mutual funds in certain retirement plans, like 401ks, where direct mutual fund investments aren't available, but brokerage options are present .\n\nVanguard Mutual Funds:\n- Mutual funds are bought and sold at the end of the trading day at the net asset value (NAV) price, regardless of what time orders are placed.\n- They often allow for the automatic investing of a fixed dollar amount, which can include fractional shares, thus making regular contributions easier to manage.\n- Some Vanguard mutual funds, such as the Admiral Shares, have a lower expense ratio which is comparable to their ETF counterparts, but these often come with a minimum investment requirement.\n- Mutual funds can be more convenient for those in the financial industry who have to request permission for every trade of equities or ETFs due to regulatory requirements. Mutual funds do not have this limitation, thus simplifying the investment process for these individuals .\n\nIn considering whether to choose a Vanguard ETF or mutual fund, investors must weigh factors such as transaction costs, investment minimums, convenience of investing, the ability to invest fixed amounts automatically, and whether they need to use more complex investment strategies like options trading or short selling which are available with ETFs. Additionally, if an investor starts with certain mutual funds and later wishes to convert to the Admiral Shares version, that conversion can be a non-taxable event, contrasting with potentially taxable events that occur when selling ETF shares to transition to mutual funds  .\n\nIt's important to note that for most retail investors, the limitations of mutual funds, such as no intra-day trading or options, may actually be beneficial as it discourages speculative behavior that may not align with long-term financial goals. Nonetheless, many brokers now offer a selection of ETFs with no transaction fees, which might make ETFs more cost-effective, especially large ETFs with narrow spreads . \n\nRemember to consider your investment style, financial goals, and whether you value the flexibility and trading advantages of ETFs over the simplicity and automatic investing benefits of mutual funds.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "See my comment for some discussion of why one might choose an identical fund over an ETF.  As to why someone would choose the higher cost fund in this instance ... The Admiral Shares version of the fund (VFIAX) has the same expense ratio as the ETF but has a minimum investment of $10K.  Some investors may want to eventually own the Admiral Shares fund but do not yet have $10K.  If they begin with the Investor Shares now and then convert to Admiral later, that conversion will be a non-taxable event.  If, however, they start with ETF shares now and then sell them later to buy the fund, that sale will be a taxable event. Vanguard ETFs are only commission-free to Vanguard clients using Vanguard Brokerage Services.  Some investors using other brokers may face all sorts of penalties for purchasing third-party ETFs.  Some retirement plan participants (either at Vanguard or another broker) may not even be allowed to purchase ETFs.",
            "Where are you planning on buying this ETF?  I'm guessing it's directly through Vanguard?  If so, that's likely your first reason - the majority of brokerage accounts charge a commission per trade for ETFs (and equities) but not for mutual funds.   Another reason is that people who work in the financial industry (brokerages, mutual fund companies, etc) have to request permission for every trade before placing an order.  This applies to equities and ETFs but does not apply to mutual funds.  It's common for a request to be denied (if the brokerage has inside information due to other business lines they'll block trading, if a mutual fund company is trading the same security they'll block trading, etc) without an explanation.  This can happen for months.  For these folks it's typically easier to use mutual funds. So, if someone can open an account with Vanguard and doesn't work in the financial industry then I agree with your premise.  The Vanguard Admiral shares have a much lower expense, typically very close to their ETFs. Source:  worked for a brokerage and mutual fund company",
            "\"One reason is that it is not possible (at Vanguard and at many other brokerages) to auto-invest into ETFs.  Because the ETF trades like a stock, you typically must buy a whole number of shares.  This makes it difficult to do auto-investing where you invest, say, a fixed dollar amount each month.  If you're investing $100 and the ETF trades for $30 a share, you must either buy 3 shares and leave $10 unspent, or buy 4 and spend $20 more than you planned.  This makes auto-investing with dollar amounts difficult.  (It would be cool if there were brokerages that handled this for you, for instance by accumulating \"\"leftover\"\" cash until an additional whole share could be purchased, but I don't know of any.) A difference of 0.12% in the expense ratios is real, but small.  It may be outweighed by the psychological gains of being able to adopt a \"\"hands-off\"\" auto-investing plan.  With ETFs, you generally must remember to \"\"manually\"\" buy the shares yourself every so often.  For many average investors, the advantage of being able to invest without having to think about it at all is worth a small increase in expense ratio.  The 0.12% savings don't do you any good if you never remember to buy shares until the market is already up.\""

        "question": "Calculation, timing, and taxes related to profit distribution of an S-corp?",
        "answer": "Profit distribution in an S-Corp is subject to certain IRS regulations which distinguish between salary and distributions to ensure reasonable compensation for services provided to the S-Corp. For instance, the IRS evaluated a case (Watson v. Commissioner) where an S-Corp owner, the sole employee, paid himself a salary far below what was customary for the industry, choosing instead to take most of the S-Corp profits as distributions. The IRS re-characterized some distribution amounts to salary up to a reasonable level based on industry standards, which, in Watson's case, was $93,000 out of a total of around $400,000 earned by the corporation. Beyond this level, the remaining funds could be taken as distributions which are not generally subject to payroll taxes.\n\nIt's worth noting that the reasoning for the differentiation between salary and distributions in this case was because the individual was not the sole person generating revenue, implying that a sole revenue-producer might be expected to account for more of the income as salary.\n\nAny decision on how to pay oneself as an owner of an S-Corp should be based on professional advice (ideally both legal and accounting), as this could provide a strong defense if the IRS audits the S-Corp's financial arrangements. It's critical not to rely solely on non-professional advice found in articles or forums on the internet when making such decisions .\n\nMoreover, for an individual who is the sole employee and revenue producer of an S-Corp, it may be hard to justify that the corporation has earned more than what their work is worth; therefore, the IRS may expect a large portion of the S-Corp's profits to be attributed to their salary. Specifically, when the amounts fall below the FICA Social Security limits, separating salary and distributions may be viewed as an attempt to evade FICA tax.\n\nTax laws and precedents are complex, so professional advice is crucial to ensuring compliance and avoiding potential issues with the IRS. In terms of timing, salary must be consistently paid throughout the year, matching standard payroll practices, while distributions can typically occur at times when the S-Corp has made a profit and after reasonable compensation has been paid.\n\nFor tax specifics related to S-Corps and their distributions, consider consulting with a tax professional who can provide personalized, legally sound advice based on the latest tax regulations and case law.",

S-Corp is a pass-through entity. We plan to use Schedule K when filing taxes for 2015. I've never filled a schedule K before, will the profit distributions be reflected on this form? Yes, that is what it is for. We might need extra help in 2015, so we plan to hire an additional   employee (who will not be a shareholder). Will our tax liability go   down by doing this? Down in what sense? Payroll is deductible, if that's what you mean.  Are there certain other things that should be kept in mind to reduce the tax liability? Yes.

            "It's whatever you decide. Taking money out of an S-Corp via distribution isn't a taxable event. Practically speaking, yes, you should make sure you have enough money to afford the distribution after paying your expenses, lest you have to put money back a few days later in to pay the phone bill. You might not want to distribute every penny of profit the moment you book it, either -- keeping some money in the business checking account is probably a good idea. If you have consistent cash flow you could distribute monthly or quarterly profits 30 or 60 days in arrears, for example, and then still have cash on hand for operations. Your net profit is reflected on the Schedule K for inclusion on your personal tax return. As an S-Corp, the profit is passed through to the shareholders and is taxable whether or not you actually distributed the money. You owe taxes on the profit reported on the Schedule K, not the amounts distributed. You really should get a tax accountant. Long-term, you'll save money by having your books set up correctly from the start rather than have to go back and fix any mistakes.

        "answer": "The document indicates that there is indeed no formal \"United States Treasury\" endorsement on Treasury-issued checks. The reasons stated are practical\u2014there is no expectation for someone from the Treasury to be endorsing checks by hand, and at most, one might expect a stamp, given that no individual would sign all the checks. It further outlines that you cannot have the check returned for proper endorsement unless you have a serious reason to believe someone other than the Treasury cashed your check. Moreover, it was clarified that an endorsement is often not required as long as the name on the check matches the name on the account to which it is deposited, although individual banks may have stricter rules .\n\nIn addition, the document sarcastically alludes to modern banking regulations like Check 21 and the Patriot Act. These acts have given the government and banks increased control over financial transactions, essentially stating that money in bank accounts is more like a \"credit\" to your account with the bank, which they can manage as they wish. Due to these regulations, banks are required to identify the parties in any banking transaction, effectively removing anonymity from banking transactions, among other things. As a result, the document suggests that the absence of a Treasury endorsement on checks is a reflection of these modern financial regulations .",

Now we have Check 21 and the Patriot Act !!! Basically what this means is that because some Arab fanatics burned down the World Trade Center, the US government and its allied civilian banking company henchmen now have total control and dictatorship over \"\"your\"\" money, which is no longer really money, but more like a \"\"credit\"\" to your account with THEM which they can do with what they want. Here are some of the many consequences of the two aforementioned acts: (1) You can no longer sue a bank for mishandling your money (2) All your banking transaction information is the joint property of the bank, its \"\"affiliates\"\" and the US Treasury (3) You can no longer conduct private monetary transactions with other people using a bank as your agent; you can only request that a bank execute an unsecured transaction on your behalf and the bank has total control over that transaction and the terms on which occurs; you have no say over these terms and you cannot sue a bank over any financial tort on you for any reason. (4) All banks are required to spy on you, report any \"\"suspicious\"\" actions on your part, develop and run special software to detect these \"\"suspicious actions\"\", and send their employees to government-run educational courses where they are taught to spy on customers, how to report suspicious customers and how to seize money and safe deposit boxes from customers when the government orders them to do so. (5) All banks are required to positively identify everyone who has a bank account or safe deposit box and report all their accounts to the government. (6) No transactions can be done anonymously. All parties to every banking transaction must be identified and recorded. So, from the above it should be clear to (if you are a lawyer) why no endorsement is present. That is because your check is not a negotiable instrument anymore, it is merely a request to the bank to transfer funds to the Treasury. The Treasury does not need to \"\"endorse\"\" anything. In fact, legally speaking, the Treasury could simply order your bank to empty your account into theirs, and they actually do this all the time to people they are \"\"investigating\"\" for supposed crimes. You don't need to endorse checks you receive either because, as I said above, the check is no longer a negotiable instrument. Banks still have people do it, but it is just a pro forma habit from the old days. Since you can't sue the bank, the endorsement is pretty meaningless because it cannot be challenged in court anyway.

        "question": "Diversify my retirement investments with a Roth IRA",
        "answer": "Diversifying your retirement investments using a Roth IRA can be a very wise decision, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement or if you are currently unable to directly contribute to a Roth IRA due to income limits. One common strategy mentioned in the document I reviewed is a \"backdoor Roth IRA contribution,\" which involves making a non-deductible contribution to a Traditional IRA and then converting it to a Roth IRA. This method can circumvent the income limits associated with direct Roth IRA contributions and can be a tax-free process if there were no previous pre-tax money in Traditional or other IRAs. Additionally, a Roth IRA can be a good place to hold investments that generate income, such as bonds or REITs, as they are typically taxed at the income rate and the Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement .\n\nMoreover, it's worth noting that conversions to a Roth IRA must be completed by December 31st of the tax year. However, the document does mention that recharacterization \u2014 reversing a Roth conversion \u2014 has a deadline of October 15th of the year following the original conversion. This recharacterization can provide some flexibility, but requires careful tax planning and is often best done when tax brackets are low .\n\nFinally, the document emphasizes the importance of starting early with your retirement savings since the longer you wait, the less time your money has to grow. Given the rules of thumb from Fidelity mentioned in the document, you should evaluate your current retirement savings and contribution plans to ensure you are on track to meet your retirement goals. The combination of a Roth IRA with your other retirement investment strategies can help you diversify your portfolio and manage your tax liabilities effectively .",

The black market provides a way to bypass these limits.\n\n4. **Privacy and Anonymity**: Transactions on the black market are generally done without official oversight, which means that they can be done anonymously. This can appeal to those wishing to avoid scrutiny over their financial dealings.\n\n5. **Speed and Convenience**: The black market can offer quicker and more convenient transactions, free from the bureaucracy and limitations of official channels.\n\n6. **Illegal Activities**: The black market is also used for money laundering and other illegal activities because it operates outside the regulated financial system.\n\nIt's important to note that dealing in the black market can be illegal and risky, with potential consequences including counterfeit currency, legal penalties, and the risk of theft or fraud.",

            "\"A falling exchange rate is an indication of falling confidence in a currency.  Countries like Iran or Venezuela, with a managed exchange rate, set their exchange rates at a higher value than the market accepts. Such market expectations may be influenced by poor government management, interventions into markets (such as nationalising businesses) or general instability / scarcity. The governments act to manage that uncertainty by limiting the availability of foreign exchange and pegging the exchange rate.   Since there is an inadequate supply of trusted foreign currency people turn to informal exchanges in order to hedge their currency risk.  This creates a negative feedback loop.  People in government who have access to foreign exchange start to trade on informal markets, pocketing the difference in the official and unofficial rates.  The increasing gap between the two rates drives increasing informal market exchange and can result in speculative bubbles. Driving instability (or economic contradiction) is that the massive and increasing difference between the official and market exchange rates becomes a powerful form of rent for government officials. This drives further state-led rent-seeking behaviour and causes the economy to become even more unstable.

It was because most of the money (USD) coming in Venezuela were not invested here but instead, given away to \"\"pimp countries\"\" like Cuba. Remember, communism lasts while you have money. Back then we had an Oil Barrel going over 100$ and crazy amounts of money were coming in the country. However, little to no money was invested in the country itself.

The inflation from 2014-2015 was 241%. Which means that having The Venezuelan currency (Bolivares) in your bank account makes no sense... in two weeks you won't be able to buy half of the things you used to with the same amount of money. 2.- A huge amount of Venezuelans dream with living abroad (me included) why, you ask? well sir, it is certain that life in this country is not the best: I hope you can understand better why people in 3rd world countries and crappy economies buy USD even at an unfavorable rate. The last question was: Q: Why would Venezuela want to block the sale of dollars? A: Centralized currency management is an Economic Measure that should last 6 months tops. (This was Argentina's case in 2013) but at this point, reverting that would take quite a few years.  However, Turukawa's wikipedia link explains that very well. Regards.\""

        "question": "Pros and Cons of Interest Only Loans",
        "answer": "Interest-only loans provide several advantages and disadvantages, which can be significant depending on individual circumstances and the state of the housing market.\n\nPros:\n1. Increased cash flow: By paying only the interest and not the principle, you can increase your monthly cash flow. This can be particularly advantageous for investors who have their investment loans on interest-only terms, as it allows them to allocate excess cash flow into offset accounts linked to the investment loans, providing a financial buffer .\n\n2. Investment opportunities: If you are disciplined, you could invest the money saved from the lower monthly payments at a higher return rate. For example, if you can invest at a return of 8% over 10 years, you could accumulate significant additional wealth compared to paying both interest and principal .\n\n3. Tax benefits: Wealthier homeowners may benefit from tax breaks and the opportunity to leverage cheap money for investment purposes .\n\nCons:\n1. No principal reduction: During the interest-only period, you do not pay off any of the principal, which means that you are entirely reliant on the property's value increasing for your equity to grow .\n\n2. Higher risk: The risk of financial difficulty increases if you are overextended, as you aren't building equity unless property prices go up. Also, a slight change in financial circumstances could lead to serious trouble if you don't have a financial buffer .\n\n3. Higher interest rates: Interest rates for interest-only loans are typically higher, since they are considered higher risk to the bank due to the fact that the principal is not being reduced. The rates are usually an eighth- to a half-percentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans .\n\n4. Tougher qualification and fewer lenders: Qualifying for interest-only loans is generally more challenging, and fewer lenders offer them because of the increased risk to the bank .\n\nIt is important to carefully consider these factors and your own financial situation before deciding on an interest-only loan.",

            "Pros: Cons: Before the housing bubble the conventional wisdom was to buy as much home as you could afford, thereby borrowing as much you can afford.  Because variable rates lead to lower mortgages, they were preferred by many as you could buy more house.   This of course lead to many people losing their home and many thousands of dollars. A bubble is not necessary to trigger a chain of events that can lead to loss of a home.  If an interest only borrower is late on a payment, this often triggers a rate increase.  Couple that with some other things that can happen negatively, and you are up $hit's creek. IMO it is not wise.",
            "\"Given the current low interest rates - let's assume 4% - this might be a viable option for a lot of people.  Let's also assume that your actual interest rate after figuring in tax considerations ends up at around 3%.  I think I am being pretty fair with the numbers. Now every dollar that you save each month based on the savings and invest with a higher net return of greater than 3% will in fact be \"\"free money\"\".  You are basically betting on your ability to invest over the 3%.  Even if using a conservative historical rate of return on the market you should net far better than 3%.  This money would be significant after 10 years.   Let's say you earn an average of 8% on your money over the 10 years.  Well you would have an extra $77K by doing interest only if you were paying on average of $500 a month towards interest on a conventional loan.  That is a pretty average house in the US.  Who doesn't want $77K (more than you would have compared to just principal).  So after 10 years you have the same amount in principal plus $77k given that you take all of the saved money and invest it at the constraints above. I would suggest that people take interest only if they are willing to diligently put away the money as they had a conventional loan.  Another scenario would be a wealthier home owner (that may be able to pay off house at any time) to reap the tax breaks and cheap money to invest. Pros: Cons: Sidenote:  If people ask how viable is this.  Well I have done this for 8 years.  I have earned an extra 110K.  I have smaller than $500 I put away each month since my house is about 30% owned but have earned almost 14% on average over the last 8 years.  My money gets put into an e-trade account automatically each month from there I funnel it into different funds (diversified by sector and region).  I literally spend a few minutes a month on this and I truly act like the money isn't there.  What is also nice is that the bank will account for about half of this as being a liquid asset when I have to renegotiate another loan.\"",
            "The advantage of interest only mortgages is that they can increase your cashflow as you are only paying the interest and not any part of the principle. We have most of our investment loans on interest only for 10 years. When we got the loans about 6 to 7 years ago our LVR was only 60% and the property prices have increased by about 40% in that time. We also place our excess cashflow into offset accounts linked to the investment loans, so there is extra cash available in case things go bad. The disadvantage of interest only mortgages is that you are not paying off any principal for the length of the interest only period. If you are over extended this could cause problems as you need to rely totally on the price of the property going up for your equity to increase. As you are currently paying mortgage insurance leads me to believe your LVR is above 80%, so you would not have much equity available in your home. With an interest only loan this could pose you some problems. You should never try to over extend yourself, the slightest thing that goes wrong could get you into financial troubles. Always try to have some buffer to help you stay on your feet if circumstances do change for the worst.",
            "\"The main disadvantage is that interest rates are higher for the interest-only loan. It's higher risk to the bank, since the principal outstanding is higher for longer.  According to the New York Times, \"\"Interest rates are usually an eighth- to a half-percentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans.\"\" They're also tougher to qualify for, and fewer lenders offer them, again due to the risk to the bank. Since you can always put extra towards the principal, strictly speaking, these are the only  downsides. The upside, of course, is that you can make a lower payment each month. The question is what are you doing with this? If this is the only way you can afford the payments, there's a good chance the house is too expensive for you. You're not building equity in the home, and you have the risk of being underwater if the house price goes down. If you're using the money for other things, or you have variable income, it might be a different story. For the former, reinvesting in a business you own might be a reason, if you're cognizant of the risks. For the latter, salespeople on commission, or financial industry types who get most of their income in bonuses, can benefit from the flexibility.\""

        "answer": "I have searched through a significant portion of the document you provided, but I did not find any information specifically addressing why big clients might want a contractor to be incorporated before giving them work. Generally, clients may prefer working with incorporated contractors for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Limited Liability**: When a contractor is incorporated, it typically means they have formed a separate legal entity, such as a corporation or a limited liability company (LLC). This limits the personal liability of the contractor for business debts and obligations.\n   \n2. **Professionalism**: Incorporation can be seen as a sign of professionalism and a commitment to the business. It suggests that the contractor is serious about their work and operates at a level that transcends individual, ad-hoc jobbing.\n\n3. **Tax Benefits**: Both the client and the incorporated contractor may benefit from tax advantages. The client may deduct the cost of the contractor's services as a business expense, and the incorporated contractor may take advantage of corporate tax structures.\n\n4. **Contractual Obligations**: Incorporated entities can enter into contracts, hire employees, and perform other functions that might be necessary or beneficial for fulfilling larger contracts.\n\n5. **Risk Mitigation**: Clients might perceive there is less risk in working with an incorporated entity, as it might suggest financial stability and a buffer against potential legal or financial issues.\n\nSince I couldn't find specific information on this topic in the provided document, would you like to provide me with more context or details that might help me assist you further?

It's my recollection that the employer gets dinged for both the employee and employer share of those withholdings (and generally the employer's share is larger than yours) so they really want to prevent it. There's a Revenue Canada publication about whether you're an employee or not. There's nothing on it about being incorporated, but still employers feel more protected when their contracts are incorporated.  We did work as a sole proprietorship at the very beginning, so that we could deduct our losses against employment income earned earlier in the year, before we started the business. You can find clients who will take you on. We incorporated once the losses were over with (basically we had bought the equipment and office supplies we needed to get started.)

        "question": "Why should one only contribute up to the employer's match in a 401(k)?",
        "answer": "One should only contribute up to the employer's match in a 401(k) primarily because the matching funds are essentially free money, giving what is effectively a 100% return on those contributions. For example, if you deposit $1000 and your employer matches that $1000, you effectively have $2000 in your 401(k).\n\nBeyond the employer match, your investment options in a 401(k) are typically more limited than those available in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Additionally, the costs associated with a 401(k) can be considerable and are generally higher than those for IRA accounts. After taking advantage of the employer match, the restricted investment choices and higher costs in a 401(k) mean that your opportunity for returns is lower compared to investing in an account with a broader range of investment options and lower fees, such as an IRA.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The matching funds are free money, so it is a very good idea to take that money off the table.  Look at it as free 100% return: you deposit $1000, your employer matches that $1000, you now have $2000 in your 401(k).  (Obviously, I'm keeping things simple.  Vesting schedules mean that the employer match isn't yours to keep immediately, but rather after some time; usually in chunks.) Beyond the employer match, you need to consider what is available for investment in a 401(k).  Typically, your options are more limited then in an IRA.  The cost of the 401(k) should be considered, as it isn't trivial for most.  (The specifics will of course vary, but in large IRA accounts are cheaper.) So, it's about the opportunity costs.  Up to the employer match, it doesn't matter as much that your investment choices are more limited in a 401(k), because you're getting 100% return just on the matching funds.  Once that is exhausted, you have more opportunity for returns, due to having more options available to you, by going with an account that provides more choices. The overall principle here is that you have to look at the whole picture.  This is similar to the notion that you should pay-down your high interest debt before investing, because from the perspective of investing the interest you're paying represent a loss, or negative return on investment, since money is going out of your accounts.  Specific to your question, you have to consider the various types of investment vehicles available to you.  It is not just about 401(k) and IRA accounts.  You may also consider a straight brokerage account, a savings account, CDs, etc.  The costs and returns that you can typically expect are your guides through the available choices.",
            "In addition to George Marian's excellent advice, I'll add that if you're hitting the limits on IRA contributions, then you'd go back to your 401(k). So, put enough into your 401(k) to get the match, then max out IRA contributions to give you access to more and better investment options, then go back to your 401(k) until you top that out as well, assuming you have that much available to invest for retirement.",
            "I'd hazard that Jim is mostly worried that people are getting ripped off by high employer 401(k) fund fees. A lot of employers offer funds with fees over 1% a year. This sounds low-ish if you don't realize that the real (inflation-adjusted) return for the fund will probably average out to about 4%, so it's really something like a quarter of your earnings gone. With an IRA, you don't have to do that. You can get an IRA provider which offers good, cheap index funds and the like (cough Vanguard cough). Fund fees will probably be closer to 0.1%-ish. HOWEVER. The maximum IRA contribution in 2013 will be $5,500. The maximum for a 401(k) contribution will be $17,500. That extra capacity is enough to recommend a 401(k) over an IRA for many people. These people may be best served by putting money into the 401(k) and then rolling it over into a rollover IRA when they change jobs. Also, certain people have retirement plans which offer them good cheap index funds. These people probably don't need to worry quite as much. Finally, having two accounts is more complicated. Please contact someone who knows more about taxes than I am to figure out what limitations apply for contributing to both IRAs and 401(k)s in the same year.",
            "\"Early this year I wrote an article Are you 401(k)o\u2019ed?  I described the data from a 401(k) expense survey and the punchline was that the average large retirement plan (over 1000 participants) expense was 1.08%, and for smaller plans it rose to 1.24%.  As I commented below, if one's goal is to make deposits with income that avoid a tax of 25%, and hope to withdraw it at retirement at 15%, it doesn't take long for a 1% fee to completely negate the benefit of pretax savings.  These numbers are averages, in the same article, I mention (ok, I brag) that my company plan has an S&P fund that costs .05%. That's 1% over 20 years.  The sound bite of \"\"deposit to the match\"\" needs to be followed by \"\"depending on the choice of investments and their expenses\"\" within the 401(k).  Every answer here has added excellent points, fennec's last sentence shouldn't be ignored, there's a phaseout for IRA deductibility, and another for Roth eligibility. For Married filing joint, IRA deduction starts to be lost at $92K, and Roth deposit disallowed at $173K. This adds a bit to the complexity of the decision, but doesn't change the implication of the 1%+ 401(k) fees.\"",
            "\"Unfortunately, I missed most of segment and I didn't get to understand the Why? To begin with, Cramer is an entertainer and his business is pushing stocks. If you put money into mutual funds (which most 401k plans limit your investments to), then you are not purchasing his product. Also, many 401k plans have limited selections of funds, and many of those funds are not good performers. While his stock-picking track record is much better than mine, his isn't that great.  He does point out that there are a lot of fees (mostly hidden) in 401k accounts. If you read your company's 5500 filing (especialy Schedule A), you can determine just how much your plan administrators are paying themselves. If paying excessive fees is your concern, then you should be rolling over your 401k into your IRA when you quit (or the employer-match vests, which ever is later).  Finally, Cramer thinks that most of his audience will max out their IRA contributions and have only a little bit left for their 401k. I'm most definately \"\"not most people\"\" as I'm maxing out both my 401k and IRA contributions.\"",
            "If you exceed the income limit for deducting a traditional IRA (which is very low if you are covered by a 401(k) ), then your IRA options are basically limited to a Roth IRA. The Cramer person probably meant to compare 401(k) and IRA from the same pre-/post-tax-ness, so i.e. Traditional 401(k) vs. Traditional IRA, or Roth 401(k) vs. Roth IRA. Comparing a Roth investment against a Traditional investment goes into a whole other topic that only confuses what is being discussed here. So if deducting a traditional IRA is ruled out, then I don't think Cramer's advice can be as simply applied regarding a Traditional 401(k). (However, by that logic, and since most people on 401(k) have Traditional 401(k), and if you are covered by a 401(k) then you cannot deduct a Traditional IRA unless you are super low income, that would mean Cramer's advice is not applicable in most situations. So I don't really know what to think here.)"

        "question": "What is the easiest way to back-test index funds and ETFs?",
        "answer": "The easiest way to back-test index funds and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) is by using historical data and software that allows for simulation of investment strategies over a specific period. Here is a simplified step-by-step guide you could follow:\n\n1. **Gather Historical Data**: Obtain the historical price data for the index funds and ETFs you want to back-test. This data can usually be found on financial websites, through investment platforms, or via APIs that provide stock market data.\n\n2. **Choose a Back-testing Platform**: There are various types of software available that can help with back-testing, from simple spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel to specialized back-testing platforms like QuantConnect, Backtrader, and TradingView. These platforms generally offer comprehensive tools and allow you to simulate trading strategies using past data.\n\n3. **Define Your Strategy**: Determine the rules of your investment strategy. This includes entry and exit points, position sizing, rebalancing frequency, and other relevant criteria.\n\n4. **Simulate Trades**: Input your strategy parameters into the back-testing platform and run the simulation. The software will apply your strategy to the historical data and execute hypothetical trades according to your rules.\n\n5. **Analyze the Results**: After running the simulation, analyze the performance metrics provided by the back-testing software. Common metrics include total return, annualized return, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and other risk/return indicators.\n\n6. **Adjust and Repeat**: Based on the results, you may want to adjust your strategy and back-test again. This could involve changing the timing of trades, adjusting stop-loss levels, or diversifying with additional assets.\n\nIt's important to note that back-testing has limitations. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and simulated trades do not take into account factors such as market impact, liquidity constraints, and changes in market conditions that can affect the outcome of real-world trades.\n\nIf you've uploaded a specific document or manual related to back-testing or a tool you might like to use, I can offer more specific guidance.

A consultant can advise on how these life changes impact your taxes.\n\n3. **New Tax Laws**: If there have been recent changes to tax laws that you're not familiar with, a consultant who's up-to-date with the latest tax legislation can ensure you comply with the new rules.\n\n4. **Deductions and Credits**: You may not be aware of all the deductions and credits you're entitled to. Tax consultants can help identify these to potentially reduce your tax liability.\n\n5. **Avoiding Mistakes**: Mistakes on tax returns can lead to audits, penalties, and fines. A tax consultant can help minimize these risks.\n\n6. **Audit Representation**: If you're facing an audit, a tax consultant can represent you before the IRS, which can be incredibly beneficial.\n\n7. **Saving Time**: Doing your taxes can be time-consuming, especially if your finances are complex.

Tax shelters usually don't come into play for this level of income.  However, there are certain things which provide deductions. Some things that make it better to pay someone:   Use the free online tax forms to sandbox your returns.  If all you're concerned about is ensuring you pay your taxes correctly, this is the most cost efficient route. If you want to minimize your tax burden, consult with a CPA.  Be sure to get one who is familiar with resident aliens from your country and the relevant tax treaties. The estimate you're looking at may be the withholding, of which you may be eligible for a refund for some part of that withholding.   Tax treaties likely make sure that you get credit on each side for the money paid in the other.  For example, as a US citizen, if I go to Europe and work and pay taxes there, I can deduct the taxes paid in Europe from my tax burden in the US.  If I've already paid more to the EU than I would have paid on the same amount earned in the US, then my tax burden in the US is zero.

            "Good professional tax advice is expensive. If your situation is simple, then paying someone doesn't give you more than you could get from a simple software package.  In this case, doing your own taxes will save you money this year, and also help you next year, as your situation grows steadily more complex. If you don't do your own taxes when you're single with a part time job, you'll never do it when you have a family, a full time job, a side business, and many deductions. Learning how to do your taxes over time, as your 'tax life' becomes complex, is a valuable skill. If your situation is complex, you will need pay a lot to get it done correctly. Sometimes, that cost is worthwhile. At bare minimum, I would say 'attempt to do your taxes yourself, first'. This will force you to organize your files, making the administrative cost of doing your return lower (ie: you aren't paying your tax firm to sort your receipts, because you've already ordered them nicely with your own subtotals, everything perfectly stapled together). If your situation is complex, and you find a place to get it done cheaply (think H&R Block), you will not be getting value for service. I am not saying a low-end tax firm will necessarily get things wrong, but if you don't have a qualified professional (read: university educated and designated) doing your return, the complexities can be ignored. Low-end tax firms typically hire seasonal staff, train them for 1-2 weeks, and mostly just show them how to enter tax slips into the same software you could buy yourself. If you underpay for professional services, you will pay the price, metaphorically speaking. For your specific situation, I strongly recommend you have a professional service look at your returns, because you are a non-resident, meaning you likely need to file in your home country as well. Follow what they do with your return, and next year, see how much of it you can do yourself. Before you hire someone, get a fee quote, and shop around until you find someone you are comfortable with. $1k spent now could save you many headaches in the future.",

Then your W-2 at the end of the year should tell you to put 63,750 in a particular box on your 1040 form.  (63,750 is 85% of 75,000).  Lets then assume 63,750 is your AGI after other additions and subtractions.  63,750 - 4,050 - 6,300 == 53,400. The federal Tax system is graduated, meaning there are different ranges (brackets) with different percentages.  The term tax people use for taxable income of 53,400 is \"\"marginal tax rate\"\"...so the last dollar they tax at 25%.  Other dollars less.  According to the IRS, if you're single, then on 53,400, you pay \"\"$6,897.50 plus 25% of the amount over $50,400\"\"  Or 6897.50 + 750, or 7647.50. Note this is only Federal Income Tax.  You will also be paying Social Security and Medicare payroll Tax.  And I'm guessing you'll also be paying colorado state income tax.  Each state has its own forms and methods for figuring out the taxes and stuff. By the way, when you start, you'll fill out a \"\"W-4\"\" form to \"\"help\"\" you figure out how much to withhold from every paycheck.  (I find the W-4 is not helpful at all).  Your company will withhold from your paycheck some mysterious amount, and the process of filling out your 1040A or 1040EZ or whatever will be, likely, to get the over-withheld amount back.\"",
            "\"Whether you do decide to go with a tax advisor or not, be sure to do some research on your own. When we moved to the US about 5 years ago, I did find the taxes here pretty complicated and confusing.  I went ahead and read up all different tax documents and did some calculations of my own before hiring a CPA (at that point, I just wanted a second opinion to make sure I got the calculations right). However, when the office of the CPA was finished with my taxes, I found they had made a mistake! When I went back to their office to point it out, the lady just shrugged, corrected her numbers on the form and said \"\"You seem to know a lot about this stuff already. Why are you here?\"\" I swore to never use them again - not this particular CPA at least. Now, I am not saying all CPAs are the same - some of them are pretty darn good at their job and know what they are doing. All I am saying is it helps to be prepared and know some basic stuff. Just don't go in all blind.  After all, they are also humans prone to mistakes and your taxes are your liability in the end.  My suggestion is to start with a good tool that supports tax filing for non-residents. Most of them provide a step-by-step QA based tool. As you go through the steps, Google each question you don't understand. It may take more time than hiring a tax advisor directly but in the end it will all be worth it.\"",

        "question": "Non Resident aliens - Question of standard vs itemized",
        "answer": "According to the information retrieved from the document, nonresident aliens usually do not have the option to take the standard deduction on their U.S. tax returns. However, there is a special rule that applies to students and business apprentices from India due to a specific provision within a treaty between the United States and India. Under this rule, nonresident aliens from India who qualify can claim the standard deduction using Worksheet 5-1 that is found within IRS Publication 519, \"Tax Guide for Aliens.\" It is important for those from India who are married and have spouses who file a return and itemize deductions to note that they cannot take the standard deduction in that case .\n\nThis is a unique exception, as the general principle is that nonresident aliens do not qualify for the standard deduction. Those who believe the IRS interpretation of the law is incorrect and decide to take the deduction anyway may end up in U.S. Tax Court, but it is advised that the potential legal costs could exceed the marginal tax benefits of such a claim. \n\nPlease keep in mind that these tax rules can be complex and may change, so it is always recommended to consult the latest version of IRS Publication 519 or a tax professional for the most current and personalized advice.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The IRS' primary reference Pub 519 Tax Guide for Aliens -- current year online (current and previous years downloadable in PDF from the Forms&Pubs section of the website) says NO: Students and business apprentices from India.   A special rule applies .... You can claim the standard deduction .... Use Worksheet 5-1 to figure your standard deduction. If you are married and your spouse files a return and itemizes deductions, you cannot take the standard deduction. Note the last sentence, which is clearly an exception to the 'India rule', which is already an exception to the general rule that nonresident filers never get the standard deduction. Of course this is the IRS' interpretation of the law (which is defined to include ratified treaties); if you think they are wrong, you could claim the deduction anyway and when they assess the additional tax (and demand payment) take it to US Tax Court -- but I suspect the legal fees will cost you more than the marginal tax on $6300, even under Tax Court's simplified procedures for small cases."

        "question": "What's the difference between Term and Whole Life insurance?",
        "answer": "Term life insurance and whole life insurance serve the same primary purpose\u2014to provide a death benefit to beneficiaries in the event of the insured's death. However, there are key differences between the two types of policies:\n\n**Term Life Insurance**:\n- Provides life insurance coverage for a specific term or period (e.g., 10, 20, 30 years).\n- If the policyholder dies within the term, the death benefit is paid out to the beneficiaries.\n- It is generally less expensive than whole life insurance for a comparable death benefit.\n- There is no cash value accumulation with term life insurance; if the policyholder outlives the term, there is no payout.\n- It is considered straightforward and easy to compare among policies, and ideal for temporary coverage needs .\n\n**Whole Life Insurance**:\n- Provides lifetime coverage, as long as premiums are paid.\n- It tends to be more expensive due to the permanent coverage and the accumulation of cash value.\n- Part of the premiums paid into a whole life policy contribute to a cash value, which can grow over time and be borrowed against if needed.\n- The cash value component renders these policies more complex and difficult to compare. Whole life policies can also be structured to be \"paid-up,\" meaning premiums need not be paid for the individual's entire life.\n- Whole life can be especially useful in certain estate planning situations, like owning a business or property that would result in significant transactional costs upon transfer to heirs .\n\nIn summary, term life insurance is generally best suited for individuals who have temporary or specific time-bound financial protection needs, while whole life insurance is more appropriate for individuals looking for permanent protection with a cash value component that can be used as an estate planning tool or as a forced savings mechanism.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Whole life insurance accumulates a cash value on a pre-tax basis. With a paid-up policy, you make payments until a particular age (usually 65 or 70), at which point you are insured for the rest of your life or a very old age like 120. You can also access this pool of money via loans while you are still alive, but you reduce your benefit until you repay the loans. This may be advantageous if you have a high net worth. Also, if you own a business or farm, a permanent policy may be desirable if the transfer of your property to heirs is likely to generate alot of transactional costs like taxes. Nowadays there are probably better ways to do that too. Whole life/universal life is a waste of money 95%+ of the time. An example, my wife and I were recently offered open-enrollment (no medical exam) insurance policies our employers in New York. We're in our early 30's. I bought a term policy paying about $400k which costs $19/mo. My wife was offered a permanent policy that pays $100k which costs $83/mo, and would have a cash value of $35k at age 65. If you invested the $60/mo difference between those policies and earned 5%/year with 30% taxes on the gains, you'd have over $40k with 4x more coverage.",
            "\"Whole life is life insurance that lasts your whole life.  Seriously. Since the insurance company must make a profit, and since they know they will always pay out on a whole life policy, whole life tends to be very expensive, and has lower \"\"death\"\" benefits than a term policy. Some of these policies are \"\"paid-up\"\" policies, meaning that they are structured so that you don't have to pay premiums forever.  But what it amounts to is that the insurance company invests your premiums, and then pays you a smaller \"\"dividend,\"\" much like banks do with savings accounts. Unless you are especially risk-averse, it is almost always a better decision to get an inexpensive term policy, and invest the money you save yourself, rather than letting the insurance company invest it for you and reap most of the benefits. If you are doing things properly, you won't need life insurance your whole life, as retirement investments will eventually replace your working income.\"",
            "For most people Term is the way to go. I consider life insurance a necessity not an investment. See this article on SmartMoney.",
            "Just to add to @duffbeer703 comment, additionally, the cash value is NOT part of the death benefit. The policy is intended to grow the cash value to the point where it matches the death benefit and then it 'matures' and you get the cash. My point being, is that since they don't give you both, you are really transferring the reponsiblity from them to you over time, your savings (that you lose) becomes part of the death benefit and they supliment it with less and less over the years so that it would equal the death benefit. @duffbeer703 nailed it right on the head, buy term and invest the difference and once you've got your savings built, really the need for insurance isn't there any longer (if you've got 1/2 million saved, do you really need insurance?)",
            "Term life insurance is just that - life insurance that pays out if you die, just like car insurance pays out if you have an accident. Like car insurance, it's easy to compare amongst term life insurance policies - you can even compare quotes online.  Whole life insurance is life insurance plus an investment component. The money that you pay goes to pay for your life insurance and it also is invested by the insurance company. Insurance companies love whole life because it is not a commodity; they can come up with a large variety of variants, and that fact plus the fact that it combines insurance and investment means that is very difficult to compare policies. Not to mention that fact that none of the companies - as far as I can tell - publish their whole life insurance rates, so it is very difficult to shop around."

        "question": "Should you keep your stocks if you are too late to sell?",
        "answer": "Whether or not you should keep your stocks if you feel you are too late to sell can depend on several factors:\n\n1. **Investment Time Horizon**: If you have the time to wait out a market downturn, historical trends suggest that markets tend to recover over the long term. Therefore, by staying invested, you might not lose anything as the markets recover. If you are a long-term investor, it might be advisable to hold on to your stocks instead of selling during a market drop .\n\n2. **Portfolio Rebalancing Consideration**: If your investment strategy involves a specific asset allocation, you'll need to evaluate if this allocation still aligns with your goals. In some instances, revaluing your holdings annually, and adjusting investments to maintain the desired ratio might be more prudent than responding to short-term market fluctuations .\n\n3. **Market Liquidity and Mechanics**: Even during market crashes and volatilities, it is typically possible to sell stocks as for every seller, there is a buyer, and vice versa. Market participants include market makers on exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE who facilitate liquidity, ensuring that there is always someone to buy or sell stocks at market price. Only if you set a limit order that's away from the market price might your order not execute .\n\n4. **Investment Strategy and Objectives**: Your decision should reflect your investment strategy and objectives. If you wouldn't buy the stock at its current price based on its fundamentals, it might be an indication that holding it may not align with your strategy. Review your hedging strategies, and consider whether the fundamental reasons for investing in a company have changed .\n\n5. **Emotional and Psychological Factors**: It's important to avoid emotional decision-making. For instance, selling a declining stock might be hard due to the \"Loss Aversion\" and \"Sunk Cost\" fallacies. It can be helpful to have a pre-determined strategy about when to sell a stock, based on objective goals such as a targeted price or percentage gain/loss .\n\nIn summary, the decision to sell should be based on rational assessment of your financial goals, investment strategy, and market conditions rather than the fear of being too late. If in doubt, it can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor. Always remember to consider the tax implications, transaction fees, and other costs associated with selling the stocks.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "In my opinion, the average investor should not be buying individual stocks. One reason why is that the average investor is not capable of reading financial statements and evaluating whether a stock is overpriced or underpriced. As such, they're often tempted to make buy/sell decisions based solely on the current value of a stock as compared to the price at which they bought it. The real reasons to buy (or sell) a stock is the expectation of future growth of the company (or continued profit and expected dividends). If you aren't able to analyze a company's financial statements and business plan, then you really aren't in a position to evaluate that company's stock price. So instead of asking whether to sell based on a recent drop in stock price, you should be investigating why the stock price is falling, and deciding whether those reasons indicate a trend that you expect to continue.  If you buy and sell stocks based solely on recent trends in the stock price, you probably will end up buying stocks that have recently risen and selling stocks that have recently fallen. In that case, you are buying high and selling low, which is a recipe for poor financial outcomes.",
            "\"The price at which a stock was purchased is a sunk cost--that is, you cannot go back in time and reverse the decision you made to purchase that stock.  Another example of a sunk cost would be purchasing a non-refundable, non-transferable movie ticket.  Sunk costs have the tendency to create a cognitive bias in which we feel that the amount we paid at some point in the past should have some sort of bearing on the decision we make now--the purchaser of the ticket feels he must go see the movie even if he no longer wishes too, lest the ticket \"\"go to waste\"\"... the investor hopelessly clings to a battered stock for that tiny chance that just maybe some day it will return to its former glory.  This is referred to as the \"\"sunk cost fallacy\"\" and is considered to be irrational behavior by economists. Keeping this in mind, your hopes and dreams for the stock at the time you purchased it should have no bearing on the decision you make now.  Similarly, whether the stock has risen or fallen in price since your purchase date should have no bearing.  Instead, you must consider what you expect the stock to do from this very moment on into the future--that is, you must act at the margin. You've indicated that you are faced with two choices--sell the stock now, incur the loss, but benefit from the tax break (Option A).  This benefit is quite easily quantifiable--it is your marginal tax rate multiplied by the additive inverse of the loss (assuming you have/will have other gains to offset).  Let's just assume that you incurred a $1000 loss, at a marginal tax rate of 20%, which means your tax benefit for the loss is $200. The second choice--to hold the stock in hopes of it rising in price (Option B)--is a bit harder to quantify.  You must assume that today is day zero, and that every cent in price the stock rises is a gain to you, and every cent in price the stock looses is a loss to you.  If you believe that the stock will rise to a price that will net your more than your tax benefit from option A, then holding the stock is more favorable than selling it at a loss today.  Conversely, if you believe this stock will fall even further in the future, or not rise enough to net you $200 (per the example), then Option A is preferable. Granted, there are some additional complications that play into your decision.  By selling the stock today, you not only get a tax benefit from the loss, but you've also freed up the funds previously used to purchase that stock to be invested elsewhere (in hopefully a better performing asset).  If you choose to stick with your current stock, then the gains you may have netted elsewhere must be considered as an opportunity cost associated with Option B.  Finally, the tax benefit is essentially guaranteed (so in our example, a $200 risk free return), while sticking with the stock in Option B still comes with some risk.\"",
            "Personally, I have been in that situation too often that now I am selling at the first tick down! (not exactly but you get the idea..) I have learned over the years to not fall in love with any stock, and this is a very hard thing to do. Limit your losses and take profit when you are satisfied with them. Nothing prevents you from buying back in this stock but why buying when it is going down?   Just my 2 cents.",
            "The stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stock's current profitability and prospects, but is also based on prediction of how the stock's prospects might change in the future. In almost every case, there are professional investors analysing the stock's future prospects and considering whether it's over or under values for its current price. However even professionals can be totally wrong.  If you feel like you have a good grasp on whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time, then you might be (if you're right) equipped to make a sensible decision on whether to hold the stock or not. If you don't think you have a good understanding about the stock, then an understanding of the general market direction might at least make stock in general worth holding. Otherwise, you are simply taking a punt. If you know of another stock that has better prospects, then ask yourself why you would hold onto the stock that you think will perform worse.  But also bear in mind that (in my understanding) research has shown that, on average, people who try to pick stocks rarely do better than a random selection, and more stock trades means more brokerage (which thanks to brokerage losses would mean you will end up doing worse than average unless you really do know better than the market).",
            "The standard answer on any long term stock is hold on during the rough times.  You have not lost anything until you sell.  If your concern is just that you are not certain where the stock price is headed, unless you need the money now and can not afford to hold on to the stock then I would hold it.",
            "\"You should distinguish between the price and the value of a company:  \"\"Price is what you pay, value is what you get\"\". Price is the share price you pay for one share of the company. Value is what a company is worth (based on fundamental analysis, one of the principles of value investing).  I would recommend selling the stock only if the company's value has deteriorated due to fundamental changes (e.g. better products from competitors, declining market) and its value is lower than the current share price.\"",
            "If the stock starts to go down DO NOT SELL!! My reasoning for this is because, when you talk about the stock market, you haven't actually lost any money until you sell the stock.

        "question": "How does spot-futures arbitrage work in the gold market?",
        "answer": "Spot-futures arbitrage in the gold market involves buying gold in the spot market (where commodities are traded for immediate delivery) and simultaneously selling gold futures contracts (where commodities are traded for delivery at a future date). The arbitrage opportunity arises when there is a price difference between the spot market and the futures market that is sufficient to cover the costs of the transaction and provide a profit.\n\nFor instance, you might buy 100 ounces of gold at a spot price of $1240 per ounce, which would cost you $124,000. At the same time, you could sell a gold futures contract (for example, for delivery in August 2014) at a price of $1256 per ounce, which would give you $125,600. This would result in a theoretical profit of $1,600. However, this profit needs to be compared to the opportunity cost of a risk-free investment, like a 1-year Certificate of Deposit (CD) which might earn $1240 on a $124,000 investment.\n\nMoreover, there are various pitfalls associated with spot-futures arbitrage. Many retail futures brokers prefer speculative traders over those who wish to sell contracts against delivery or buy for delivery. Traders are also required to keep margin money on deposit. If the price of gold rises and you have a short position in gold futures, then you would need to deposit more margin money. This could significantly cut into the profits if the money has to be borrowed at interest.\n\nIt should be mentioned that futures trades may have low commissions, but they also have bid/ask spreads and price volatility, which can affect profitability. The spot market in physical gold may have a higher bid/ask spread as well. Additionally, to effectively trade in the gold market for delivery purposes, you might need to handle depository receipts instead of trading physical gold directly, which can entail additional expenses such as testing and certification.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to note that arbitrageurs in the gold market make sure that the futures and spot market prices don't diverge significantly, and since arbitraging is highly automated, any potential profits can be quickly captured by these market participants .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "You're missing the cost-of-carry aspect: The cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity, such as grain or metals, over a period of time. The carrying charge includes insurance, storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs. In interest rate futures markets, it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument. So in a nutshell, you'd have to store the gold (safely), invest your money now, i.e. you're missing out on interests the money could have earned until the futures delivery date.  Well and on top of that you need to get the gold shipped to London or wherever the agreed delivery place is. Edit: Forgot to mention that of course there are arbitrageurs that make sure the futures and spot market prices don't diverge. So the idea isn't that bad as I might have made it sound but being in the arbitrage business myself I should disclaim that profits are small and arbitraging is highly automated, so before you spot a $1 profit somewhere between any two contracts, you can be quite sure it's been taken by an arbitrageur already.",
            "\"As proposed: Buy 100 oz of gold at $1240 spot = -$124,000 Sell 1 Aug 2014 Future for $1256 = $125,600 Profit $1,600 Alternative Risk-Free Investment: 1 year CD @ 1% would earn $1240 on $124,000 investment. Rate from ads on www.bankrate.com \"\"Real\"\" Profit All you are really being paid for this trade is the difference between the  profit $1,600 and the opportunity for $1240 in risk free earnings.  That's only $360 or around 0.3%/year.   Pitfalls of trying to do this: Many retail futures brokers are set up for speculative traders and do not want to deal with customers selling contracts against delivery, or buying for delivery. If you are a trader you have to keep margin money on deposit.  This can be a T-note at some brokerages, but currently T-notes pay almost 0%.   If the price of gold rises and you are short a future in gold, then you need to deposit more margin money.  If gold went back up to $1500/oz, that could be $24,400.  If you need to borrow this money, the interest will eat into a very slim profit margin over the risk free rate.   Since you can't deliver, the trades have to be reversed.  Although futures trades have cheap commissions ~$5/trade, the bid/ask spread, even at 1 grid, is not so minimal.  Also there is often noisy jitter in the price.  The spot market in physical gold may have a higher bid/ask spread. You might be able to eliminate some of these issues by trading as a hedger or for delivery.  Good luck finding a broker to let you do this... but the issue here for gold is that you'd need to trade in depository receipts for gold that is acceptable for delivery, instead of trading physical gold.  To deliver physical gold it would likely have to be tested and certified, which costs money. By the time you've researched this, you'll either discover some more costs associated with it or could have spent your time making more money elsewhere.\""

        "answer": "OkPay is not allowed in the United States primarily due to regulatory challenges and licensing issues. According to information provided, the US Treasury has designated firms dealing in virtual currencies, such as OkPay, as \"money services businesses,\" which obliges them to comply with government regulations to prevent money laundering by handing over transaction information to the government.\n\nIn addition, the passage of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in 2010 has placed compliance standards on foreign banks, requiring them to report accounts held by American citizens worth over $50,000, subjecting non-compliance to penalties and possible exclusion from US markets. As a result of these regulations, banks that OkPay interfaces with have chosen not to work with US clients to avoid these strict compliance and reporting requirements .\n\nMoreover, the document also indicates that OkPay, which offers ways to transfer funds, including credit cards and cryptocurrencies, faces additional scrutiny related to its interaction with Bitcoins. Bitcoin exchanges are a contentious subject for US regulators, further complicating OkPay's licensing situation and ability to operate in the US .\n\nThere seems to be an acknowledgment from OkPay, as per the client services, that it is a licensing issue, but they do not elaborate nor suggest that they plan to resolve this issue. The overall implication is that the issues OkPay faces in the US appear to be part of broader regulatory pressures it faces in multiple jurisdictions, not just in the US .",

According to multiple sources online, including the thread referenced by MD-Tech's answer, OkPay either cannot or will not get a license, so they are out. I dug on this a bit more because I thought it was interesting, and OkPay has other issues with U.S. and other regulators related to its interaction with Bitcoins, which themselves are a hot potato for regulation right now and may explain the licensing problem.  It seems to also be facing regulatory pressure in other countries, by the way, so it's not strictly a problem they face in the U.S.  Just for whatever reason, the problem is greater here.  Some interesting summary points: With mounting pressure on online money exchanges from US regulators, payments processor OKPay has announced that it is suspending processing for all Bitcoin exchanges, including industry leader Mt. Gox. ... Earlier this month, the US Department of Homeland Security seized Mt. Gox's account with mobile payment processor Dwolla, on allegations that the account was in violation of US Code 18 USC \u00a7 1960 by operating an \"\"unlicensed money transmitting business.\"\" Just where the Bitcoin market falls under US law is unclear, because the legality of Bitcoin transactions has yet to be tried in court and law enforcement has refused to comment on ongoing investigations, such as the Dwolla case. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/29/okpay_suspends_bitcoin_processing/ In March, the US Treasury said any firms dealing in the virtual currency would be considered \"\"money services businesses\"\" just like any other, which means they must hand over transaction information to the government and work to prevent money laundering. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/15/mt_gox_us_court/ In the UK, it apparently has also had trouble with banking partners (quoting a OkPay official regarding changing bank providers): The UK bank that we used before did not make a final decision on whether to handle transactions in favour of crypto-currencies or not. Therefore the compliance department of the bank asked us to restrict such transfers. This apparently allowed them to reverse a policy in the UK: OKPAY's policy shift comes just months after it stipulated that GBP users check a box, verifying that their funds would not be spent on cryptocurrency, a feature that further incited users. http://www.coindesk.com/okpay-gbp-bitcoin-transactions/ I hadn't heard of this company prior to your question, but having done some research, I tend to think that at least the part of this quote about language, attributed to a user, is true: OKPAY are quite paranoid about AML and another problem is that their support people seem to be very bad at English, so their replies are often hard to understand. Their support are also slow [sic]. However in my experience they are an honest company. I found at least one case where rumors that the entire company were going to shut down were traced back to a poorly translated message issued by the company. Again, I know only what I read just now about this company, but it looked like there were a few red flags - the problems with the US probably not being the most important.  This type of service is probably part of the future, but I'm not sure that I'd send money through it now in its current state or organization and regulation.\"",

            "Here's the real reason OKPay (actually the banks they interface with) won't accept US Citizens.   The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Congress passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in 2010 without much fanfare. One reason the act was so quiet was its four-year long ramp up; FATCA did not really take effect until 2014. Never before had a single national government attempted, and so far succeeded in, forcing compliance standards on banks across the world. FATCA requires any non-U.S. bank to report accounts held by American citizens worth over $50,000 or else be subject to 30% withholding penalties and possible exclusion from U.S. markets. By mid-2015, more than 100,000 foreign entities had agreed to share financial information with the IRS. Even Russia and China agreed to FATCA. The only major global economy to fight the Feds is Canada; however it was private citizens, not the Canadian government, who filed suit to block FATCA under the International Governmental Agreement clause making it illegal to turn over private bank account information.

        "question": "Tax Witholding for Stock Sale",
        "answer": "The document contains information about tax withholding and considerations when selling stocks, which includes how capital gains are taxed based on the duration of holding the stock. For ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan) stocks, the discount that an employee receives is taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains are taxed at different rates depending on how long they have been held. Furthermore, the document discusses the application of wash sale rules, which can affect the deductibility of losses from the sale of securities.\n\nThe document also explains that US stockbrokers do not typically withhold taxes on dividends/interest/distributions or realized capital gains, as such gains might be offset by later losses. Instead, taxpayers are generally required to pay most of their taxes during the year into withholding and/or estimated payments. If the tax on one's income, including capital gains, is expected to exceed their withholding by a significant amount, it may be necessary to adjust withholding or make an estimated tax payment. Long-term capital gains from investments held more than one year are taxed at lower rates compared to short-term gains, which are taxed as ordinary income. Individuals may be exempt from penalties for underpayment if they met certain conditions related to their previous year's tax situation .\n\nFor specific advice on tax withholding or planning related to stock sales, it's recommended to consult a tax professional, such as an Enrolled Agent (EA) or Certified Public Accountant (CPA), who is licensed in your state . \n\nIf you have a particular scenario or further questions regarding tax withholding for stock sales, please provide more details, and I can help guide you to the relevant information.",

            "I assume US as mhoran_psprep edited, although I'm not sure IRS necessarily means US. (It definitely used to also include Britain's Inland Revenue, but they changed.)  (US) Stockbrokers do not normally withhold on either dividends/interest/distributions or realized capital gains, especially since gains might be reduced or eliminated by later losses. (They can be required to apply backup withholding to dividends and interest; don't ask how I know :-) You are normally required to pay most of your tax during the year, defined as within 10% or $1000 whichever is more, by withholding and/or estimated payments. Thus if the tax on your income including your recent gain will exceed your withholding by 10% and $1000, you should either adjust your withholding or make an estimated payment or some combination, although even if you have a job the last week of December is too late for you to adjust withholding significantly, or even to make a timely estimated payment if 'earlier in the year' means in an earlier quarter as defined for tax (Jan-Mar, Apr-May, June-Aug, Sept-Dec). See https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes and for details its link to Publication 505. But a 'safe harbor' may apply since you say this is your first time to have capital gains. If you did not owe any income tax for last year (and were a citizen or resident), or (except very high earners) if you did owe tax and your withholding plus estimated payments this year is enough to pay last year's tax, you are exempt from the Form 2210 penalty and you have until the filing deadline (normally April 15 but this year April 18 due to weekend and holiday) to pay. The latter is likely if your job and therefore payroll income and withholding this year was the same or nearly the same as last year and there was no other big change other than the new capital gain. Also note that gains on investments held more than one year are classified as long-term and taxed at lower rates, which reduces the tax you will owe (all else equal) and thus the payments you need to make. But your wording 'bought and sold ... earlier this year' suggests your holding was not long-term, and short-term gains are taxed as 'ordinary' income. Added: if the state you live in has a state income tax similar considerations apply but to smaller amounts. TTBOMK all states tax capital gains (and other investment income, other than interest on exempt bonds), and don't necessarily give the lower rates for long-term gains. And all states I have lived in have 'must have withholding or estimated payments' rules generally similar to the Federal ones, though not identical."

        "question": "Why invest in becoming a landlord?",
        "answer": "Investing in becoming a landlord can be beneficial for several reasons, but it also comes with its own set of challenges and considerations:\n\n1. **Income from Rent**: One of the primary advantages of being a landlord is the potential to earn income from rent. If you charge, for instance, \u20ac600 a month and never miss a month of rental income, after 21 years you would have made \u20ac151k in rents, plus you still own the property that is likely to appreciate in value over time .\n\n2. **Property Appreciation**: In addition to rental income, the property you own may appreciate in value, potentially providing you with significant equity and asset growth over time .\n\n3. **Maintenance Skills**: Being able to perform the majority of maintenance work yourself can significantly reduce expenses, which is important as maintenance can be one of the biggest costs associated with rental properties .\n\n4. **Tenant Management**: Proper tenant screening, including requirements like a minimum credit score, can help in avoiding \"nightmare tenants\" and ensure a smoother operation of your rental business .\n\n5. **Real Estate Market Knowledge**: Understanding the local real estate market, including the laws that favor tenants or landlords, and adjusting rental rates to remain competitive can be advantageous for a landlord .\n\n6. **Age and Demographics of Tenants**: The document also suggests (though in a manner that is legally dubious) to consider the age and life situation of potential tenants as part of your strategy to reduce the risk of issues arising from renting to certain demographics .\n\n7. **Financial Management**: It is important not to over-leverage oneself with debt and to start with a financial base that allows for profitability from the beginning .\n\nHowever, there are downsides and risks involved:\n\n- There may be times with no tenant occupancy leading to no rental income.\n- The maintenance costs can be high and unexpected.\n- Dealing with tenant issues can be challenging.\n- Financial investment risks, such as market volatility and the cost of borrowing, can affect profitability.\n\nUltimately, the decision to invest in becoming a landlord should be based on careful consideration of these factors, your financial situation, the local real estate market, and your capability to manage a property. Personal characteristics and the ability to enforce disciplined saving and investing behavior also play a role in determining whether such an investment is suitable for an individual .",

            "why does it make sense financially to buy property and become a landlord? Because then your investment generates cash instead of just sitting idle. All taxes, fees and repairs aside it would take almost 21 years before I start making profits. No - your profit will be the rents that you collect (minus expenses). You still have an asset that is worth roughly what you paid for it (and might go up in value), so you don't need to recoup the entire cost of the property before making a profit. Compared to investing the same 150k in an ETF portfolio with conservative 4% in annual returns I would have made around 140k \u20ac after taxes in the same 21 years i.e. almost doubled the money. If you charge 600 \u20ac / month (and never miss a month of rental income), after 21 years you have made 151k \u20ac in rents plus you still have a property.  That property is most likely going to be worth more than you paid for it, so you should have at least 300k \u20ac in assets. Having said all that, it does NOT always make sense to invest in rental property.  Being a landlord can be a hard job, and there are many risks involved that are different that risks in financial investments.",
            "\"The value of getting into the landlord business -- or any other business -- depends on circumstances at the time. How much will it cost you to buy the property? How much can you reasonably expect to collect in rent? How easy or difficult is it to find a tenant? Etc. I owned a rental property for about ten years and I lost a bundle of money on it. Things people often don't consider when calculating likely rental income are: There will be times when you have no tenant. Someone moves out and you don't always find a new tenant right away. Maintenance. There's always something that the tenant expects you to fix. Tenants aren't likely to take as good a care of the property as someone who owned it would. And while a homeowner might fix little things himself, like a broken light switch or doorknob, the tenant expects the landlord to fix such things. If you live nearby and have the time and ability to do minor maintenance, this may be no big deal. If you have to call a professional, this can get very expensive very quickly. Like for example, I once had a tenant complain that the water heater wasn't working. I called a plumber. He found that the knob on the water heater was set to \"\"low\"\". So he turned it up. He charged me, I think it was $200. I can't really complain about the charge. He had to drive to the property, figure out that that was all the problem was, turn the knob, and then verify that that really solved the problem. Tenants don't always pay the rent on time, or at all. I had several tenants who apparently saw the rent as something optional, to be paid if they had money left over that they couldn't think of anything better to do with. You may get bad tenants who destroy the place. I had one tenant who did $10,000 worth of damage. That include six inches deep of trash all over the house that had to be cleared out, rotting food all over, excrement smeared on walls, holes in the walls, and many things broken. I thought it was disgusting just to have to go in to clean it up, I can't imagine living like that, but whatever. Depending on the laws in your area, it may be very difficult to kick out a bad tenant. In my case, I had to evict two tenants, and it took about three months each time to go through the legal process. On the slip side, the big advantage to owning real estate is that once you pay it off, you own it and can continue to collect rent. And as most currencies in the world are subject to inflation, the rent you can charge will normally go up while your mortgage payments are constant.\"",
            "\"with 150K \u20ac to invest to \"\"become a landlord\"\" you have several options: Pay for 100% of one property, and you then will make a significant percentage of the monthly rent as profit each month. That profit can be used to invest in other things, or to save to buy additional properties. At the end of the 21 years in your example, you can sell the flat for return of principal minus selling expenses, or even better make a profit because the property went up in value. Pay 20% down on 5 flats, and then make a much a smaller profit per flat each month due to the mortgage payment for each one. At the end of the 21 years sell the flats. Assuming that a significant portion of the mortgage is paid off each flat will sell for more than the mortgage balance. Thus you will have 5 nice large profits when you sell. something in between 1 and 5 flats. Each has different risks and expenses. With 5 rental properties you are more likely to use a management company, which will add to your monthly cost.\"",
            "There are at least three important aspectss missing from your equation. However they come with some uncertainty as one typically cannot tell the future performance. Appreciation of the rental units value. When comparing to the gain of any alternative investment an increasing value of the flat is a gain too. Increase of rent. Rents are typically adjusted either on a regular basis or at least when changing tennants. Calulation with a flat rent over 20 years is therefore way off. Tax deductions due to capital expenditures (i.e. mortgages), expenses for the upkeep and maintenance of the property, conserving and management, and so on. Obviously those are depending on your local legislation. There are multiple other issues to consider of course, e.g. inadvertant vacancy, which would not act in your favour.",
            "Let me add a few thoughts that have not been mentioned so far in the other answers.  Note that for the decision of buying vs. renting a home i.e. for personal use, not for renting out there's a rule of thumb that if the price for buying is more than 20 year's (cold) rents it is considered rather expensive. I don't know how localized this rule of thumb is, but I know it for Germany which is apparently the OP's country, too. There are obviously differences between buying a house/flat for yourself and in order to rent it out. As others have said, maintenance is a major factor for house owners - and here a lot depends on how much of that you do yourself (i.e. do you have the possibility to trade working hours for costs - which is closely related to financial risk exposure, e.g. increasing income by cutting costs as you do maintenance work yourself if you loose your day-time job?).  This plays a crucial role for landlords I know (they're all small-scale landlords, and most of them do put in substantial work themselves): I know quite a number of people who rent out flats in the house where they actually live. Some of the houses were built with flats and the owner lives in one of the flats, another rather typical setup is that people built their house in the way that a smaller flat can easily be separated and let once the kids moved out (note also that the legal situation for the landlord is easier in that special case). I also know someone who owns a house several 100 km away from where they live and they say they intentionally ask a rent somewhat below the market price for that (nice) kind of flat so that they have lots of applicants at the same time and tenants don't move out as finding a new tenant is lots of work and costly because of the distance.   My personal conclusion from those points is that as an investment (i.e. not for immediate or future personal use) I'd say that the exact circumstances are very important: if you are (stably) based in a region where the buying-to-rental-price ratio is favorable, you have the necessary time and are able to do maintenance work yourself and there is a chance to buy a suitable house closeby then why not. If this is not the case, some other form of investing in real estate may be better. On the other hand, investing in further real estate closeby where you live in your own house means increased lump risk - you miss diversification into regions where the value of real estate may develop very differently.  There is one important psychological point that may play a role with the observed relation between being rich and being landlord. First of all, remember that the median wealth (without pensions) for Germany is about 51 k\u20ac, and someone owning a morgage-free 150 k\u20ac flat and nothing else is somewhere in the 7th decile of wealth. To put it the other way round: the question whether to invest 150 k\u20ac into becoming a landlord is of practical relevance only for rich (in terms of wealth) people. Also, asking this question is typically only relevant for people who already own the home they live in as buying for personal use will typically have a better return than buying in order to rent. But already people who buy for personal use are on average wealthier (or at least on the track to become more wealthy in case of fresh home owners) than people who rent. This is attributed to personal characteristics and the fact that the downpayment of the mortgage enforces saving behaviour (which is typically kept up once the house is paid, and is anyways found to be more pronounced than for non-house-owners). In contrast, many people who decide never to buy a home fall short of their initial savings/investment plans (e.g. putting the 150 k\u20ac into an ETF for the next 21 years) and in the end spend considerably more money - and this group of people rarely invests into directly becoming a landlord.  Assuming that you can read German, here's a relevant newspaper article and a related press release.",
            "As a landlord for 14 years with 10 properties, I can give a few pointers: be able and skilled enough to perform the majority of maintenance because this is your biggest expense otherwise.  it will shock you how much maintenance rental units require. don't invest in real estate where the locality/state favors the tenant (e.g., New York City) in disputes.  A great state is Florida where you can have someone evicted very quickly. require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over 21.  This seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal, adjust your tenant's rent to be approximately 5% less than going rates in your area.  Use Zillow as a guide.  Keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options. do not rent to anyone under 30 and single.  Trust me trust me trust me.  you can't legally do this officially, but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection; there's always something you could say that's legitimate (bad credit, or chose another tenant, etc.) charge a 5% late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due.  20 days late, file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business. Don't sink yourself too much in debt, put enough money down so that you start profitable.  I made the mistake of burying myself and I haven't barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years.  It's just now finally coming into profitability. Don't get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances.  Fixed 30 only.  You can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20, but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20. don't even try to find your own tenants.  Use a realtor and take the 10% cost hit.  They actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner.  Empty place = empty wallet.  Also, block out the part of the realtor's agreement-to-lease where it states they keep getting the 10% every year thereafter.  Most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year, but if they don't, find another realtor. buy all in the same community if you can, then you can use the same vendor list, the same lease agreement, the same realtor, the same documentation, spreadsheets, etc.  Much much easier to have everything a clone.  They say don't put all your eggs in one basket, but the reality is, running a bunch of properties is a lot of work, and the more similar they are, the more you can duplicate your work for free.  That's worth a lot more day-to-day than the remote chance your entire community goes up in flames"

        "question": "Is there any instance where less leverage will get you a better return on a rental property?",
        "answer": "Yes, there is a scenario where using less leverage could result in a better return on a rental property compared to using higher leverage. This primarily occurs when variable rate financing is used and interest rates substantially increase, even if rental income is adequate to cover non-funding costs like maintenance, regulatory fees, taxes, and inflation.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "There are two obvious cases in which your return is lower with a heavily leveraged investment. If a $100,000 investment of your own cash yields $1000 that's a 1% return. If you put in $50,000 of your own money and borrow $50,000 at 2%, you get a 0% return (After factoring in the interest as above.) If you buy an investment for $100,000 and it loses $1000, that's a -1% return. If you borrow $100,000 and buy two investments, and they both lose $1000, that's a -2% return.",
            "\"Leverage means you can make more investments with the same amount of money.  In the case of rental properties, it means you can own more properties and generate more rents.  You exchange a higher cost of doing business (higher interest fees) and a higher risk of total failure, for a larger number of rents and thus higher potential earnings. As with any investment advice, whenever someone tells you \"\"Do X and you are guaranteed to make more money\"\", unless you are a printer of money that is not entirely true. In this case, taking more leverage exposes you to more risk, while giving you more potential gain.  That risk is not only on the selling front; in fact, for most small property owners, the risk is primarily that you will have periods of time of higher expense or lower income.  These can come in several ways: If you weather these and similar problems, then you will stand to make more money using higher leverage, assuming you make more money from each property than your additional interest costs.  As long as you're making any money on your properties this is likely (as interest rates are very low right now), but making any money at all (above and beyond the sale value) may be challenging early on.   These sorts of risks are magnified for your first few years, until you've built up a significant reserve to keep your business afloat in downturns.  And of course, any money in a reserve is money you're not leveraging for new property acquisition - the very same trade-off.  And while you may be able to sell one or more properties if you did end up in a temporarily bad situation, you also may run into 2008 again and be unable to do so.\"",
            "More leverage means more risk. There is more upside. There is also more downside. If property prices and/or rents fall then your losses are amplified. If you leverage at 90% then a 5% fall means you've lost half your money.",
            "\"I would say that you should keep in mind one simple idea.  Leverage was the principal reason for the 2008 financial meltdown.  For a great explanation on this, I would HIGHLY recommend Michael Lewis' book, \"\"The Big Short,\"\" which does an excellent job in spelling out the case against being highly leveraged. As Dale M. pointed out, losses are greatly magnified by your degree of leverage. That being said, there's nothing wrong with being highly leveraged as a short-term strategy, and I want to emphasize the \"\"short-term\"\" part.  If, for instance, an opportunity arises where you aren't presently liquid enough to cover then you could use leverage to at least stay in the game until your cash situation improves enough to de-leverage the investment.  This can be a common strategy in equities, where you simply substitute the term \"\"leverage\"\" for the term \"\"margin\"\".  Margin positions can be scary, because a rapid downturn in the market can cause margin calls that you're unable to cover, and that's disastrous. Interestingly, it was the 2008 financial crisis which lead to the undoing of Bernie Madoff.  Many of his clients were highly leveraged in the markets, and when everything began to unravel, they turned to him to cash out what they thought they had with him to cover their margin calls, only to then discover there was no money.  Not being able to meet the redemptions of his clients forced Madoff to come clean about his scheme, and the rest is history. The banks themselves were over-leveraged, sometimes at a rate of 50-1, and any little hiccup in the payment stream from borrowers caused massive losses in the portfolios which were magnified by this leveraging.  This is why you should view leverage with great caution.  It is very, very tempting, but also fraught with extreme peril if you don't know what you're getting into or don't have the wherewithal to manage it if anything should go wrong. In real estate, I could use the leverage of my present cash reserves to buy a bigger property with the intent of de-leveraging once something else I have on the market sells.  But that's only a wise play if I am certain I can unwind the leveraged position reasonably soon. Seriously, know what you're doing before you try anything like this!  Too many people have been shipwrecked by not understanding the pitfalls of leverage, simply because they're too enamored by the profits they think they can make.  Be careful, my friend.\"",
            "\"leverage amplifies gains and losses, when returns are positive leverage makes them more positive, but when returns are negative leverage makes them more negative. since most investments have a positive return in \"\"the long run\"\", leverage is generally considered a good idea for long term illiquid investments like real estate.  that said, to quote keynes: in the long run we are all dead. in the case of real estate specifically, negative returns generally happen when house prices drop. assuming you have no intention of ever selling the properties, you can still end up with negative returns if rents fall, mortgage rates increase or tax rates rise (all of which tend to correlate with falling property values). also, if cash flow becomes negative, you may be forced to sell during a down market, thereby amplifying the loss.  besides loss scenarios, leverage can turn a small gain into a loss because leverage has a price (interest) that is subtracted from any amplified gains (and added to any amplified losses). to give a specific example: if you realize a 0.1% gain on x$ when unleveraged, you could end up with a 17% loss if leveraged 90% at 2% interest. (gains-interest)/investment=(0.001*x-0.02*0.9*x)/(x/10)=-0.017*10=-0.17=17% loss one reason leveraged investments are popular (particularly with real estate), is that the investor can file bankruptcy to \"\"erase\"\" a large negative net worth.  this means the down side of a leveraged investment is limited for the highly leveraged investor. this leads to a \"\"get rich or start over\"\" mentality common among the self-made millionaire (and failed entrepreneurs).  unfortunately, this dynamic also leads to serious problems for the banking sector in the event of a large nation-wide devaluation of real estate prices.\"",
            "\"QUICK ANSWER When it comes to fixed income assets, whether rental real estate or government bonds, it's unusual for highly-leveraged assets to yield less than the same asset unleveraged or lowly-leveraged.  This is especially so in countries where interest costs are tax deductible. If we exclude capital losses (i.e. the property sells in future at a price less than it was purchased) or net rental income that doesn't keep up with maintenance, regulatory, taxation, inflation and / or other costs, there is one primary scenario where higher leverage results in lower yields compared to lower leverage, even if rental income keeps up with non-funding costs.  This occurs when variable rate financing is used and rates substantially increase. EXPLANATION Borrowers and lenders in different countries have different mortgage rate customs.  Some are more likely to have long-term fixed rates; some prefer variable rates; and others are a hybrid, i.e. fixed for a few years and then become variable. If variable rates are used for a mortgage and the reference rates increase substantially, as they did in the US during the 1970s, the borrower can easily become \"\"upside-down,\"\" i.e. owe more on the mortgage than the property is then worth, and have mortgage service costs that exceed the net rental income.  Some of those costs aren't easy to pass along to renters, even when there are periodic lease renewals or base rent increases referencing inflation rates.  Central banks set policies for what would be the lowest short-term rates in a country that has such a bank.  Private sector rates are established broadly by supply and demand for credit and can thus diverge markedly from central bank rates. Over time, the higher finance-carrying-cost-to-net-rental-income ratio should abate as (1) rental market prices change to reflect the costs and (2) the landlord can reinvest his net rental income at a higher rate.  In the short-term though, this can result in the landlord having to \"\"eat\"\" the costs making his yield on his leveraged fixed income asset less than what he would have without leverage, even if the property was later sold at same price regardless of financing method. ========== Interestingly, and on the flip side, this is one of the quirks in finance where an accounting liability can become, at least in part, an economic asset.  If a landlord borrows at a high loan-to-value ratio for a fixed interest rate for the life of the mortgage and rates, variable and fixed, were to increase substantially, the difference between his original rate and the present rates accrues to him. If he's able to sell the property with the loan attached (which is not uncommon for commercial, industrial and sometimes municipal real estate), the buyer will be assuming a liability with a lower carrying cost than his present alternatives and will hence pay a higher price for the property than if it were unleveraged. With long-term rates in many economically advanced countries at historic lows, if a borrower today were to take a long-term fixed rate loan and rates shortly after increased substantially, he may have an instant profit in this scenario even if his property hasn't increased in value.\"",
            "If you are calculating simple ROI, the answer is straightforward math.  See This Answer for some examples, but yes, with more leverage you will always see better ROI on a property IF you can maintain a positive cash flow.  The most complete answer is to factor in your total risk. That high ROI of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses. Additionally, a loss of equity in the property (or an upside-down mortgage) will further impact your long term position. To put this more simply (as noted in the comments below), your losses will be amplified. You cannot say a leveraged property will always give you a better ROI because you cannot predict your losses."

        "question": "As an employee, when is it inappropriate to request to see your young/startup company's financial statements?",
        "answer": "It's inappropriate to request to see your young/startup company's financial statements if you do not have a legal or contractual right to do so. Here are several points to consider:\n\n1. **Stockholder Inspection Rights**: If you are a stockholder, you typically have inspection rights by law. For example, Delaware General Corporate Law \u00a7 220 provides stockholders with the right to inspect and copy company financial information, subject to certain restrictions. You should check the laws and corporate code of your company's state of incorporation to find the specific inspection right. These rights could mean that even a small purchase of stock may give you the right to see the financials as an employee .\n\n2. **LLC or Partnership**: If the startup is an LLC or partnership, the operating agreement typically outlines any inspection rights, and there might be no inspection rights given to members or partners by default .\n\n3. **No Corporate Stock**: If you do not have any corporate stock, then you typically would not have statutory inspection rights .\n\n4. **Courtesy vs. Obligation**: If you are not vested as a corporate stockholder, it's generally a courtesy, not an obligation, for the company to show you the financials. So, unless you have specifically negotiated for it, the company isn't required to disclose this information to you .\n\n5. **Approaching the Request**: It is noted that the approach to requesting financials is highly personal and variable for small companies. Some people might consider it as prying or even accusatory, while others may understand that small companies are risky and that you're simply being thorough. It is recommended to keep your request vague, simple, and direct, which may raise fewer objections .\n\nGiven these considerations, if you are an employee without any stock in the company and without any particular agreement that grants you the right to view the financial statements, it would be inappropriate to request access to this sensitive information. If you believe you have a valid reason to see the financials, such as considering whether to invest in the company, you should approach the matter professionally and see if the company is willing to share a high-level summary or the information that is pertinent to your decision-making, without demanding full access to detailed financial statements.",

Check the laws and corporate code of your company's state of incorporation to find the specific inspection right.  If it is an LLC or partnership, then the operating agreement usually controls and there may be no inspection rights.  If you have no corporate stock, then of course you have no statutory inspection rights.  My (admittedly incomplete) understanding is that warrantholders generally have no inspection rights unless somehow contracted for.  So if you vest as a corporate stockholder, it'll be your right to see the financials\u2014which may make even a small purchase valuable to you as a continuing employee with the right to see the financials.  Until then, this is probably a courtesy and not their obligation. The first question is not easy to answer, except to say that it's variable and highly personal for small companies.  Some people interpret it as prying or accusatory, the implication being that the founders are either hiding something or that you need to examine really closely the mouth of their beautiful gift horse.  Other people may be much cooler about the question, understanding that small companies are risky and you're being methodical.  And in some smaller companies, they may believe giving you the expenses could make office life awkward. If you approach it professionally, directly, and briefly (do not over-explain yourself) with the responsible accountant or HR person (if any), then I imagine it should not be a problem for them to give some information.  Conversely, you may feel comfortable enough to review a high-level summary sheet with a founder, or to find some other way of tactfully reviewing the right information. In any case, I would keep the request vague, simple, and direct, and see what information they show you.  If your request is too specific, then you risk pushing them to show information A, which they refuse to do, but a vague request would've prompted them to show you information B.  A too-specific request might get you information X when a vague request could have garnered XYZ.  Vague requests are also less aggressive and may raise fewer objections. The third question is difficult to say.  My personal understanding is some perspective of how venture capitalists look at the investment opportunity (you didn't say how new this startup is or what series/stage they are on, so I'll try to stay vague). The actual financials are less relevant for startups than they are for other investments because the situation will definitely change.  Most venture capital firms like to look at the burn rate or amount of cash spent, usually at a monthly rate.  A high burn rate relative to infusions of cash suggests the company is growing rapidly but may have a risk of toppling (i.e. failing before exit).  Burn rate can change drastically during the early life of the startup.  Of course burn rate needs the context of revenues and reserves (and latest valuation is helpful as a benchmark, but you may be able to calculate that from the restricted share offer made to you).  High burn rate might not be bad, if the company is booming along towards a successful exit. You might also want to look at some sort of business plan or info sheet, rather than financials alone.  You want to gauge the size of the market (most startups like to claim 9- or 10-figure markets, so even a few percentage points of market share will hit revenue into the 8-figures).  You'll also have to have a sense for the business plan and model and whether it's a good investment or a ridiculous rehash (\"\"it's Twitter for dogs meets Match.com for Russian Orthodox singles!\"\").  In other words, appraise it like an investor or VC and figure out whether it's a prospect for decent return.  Typical things like competition, customer acquisition costs, manufacturing costs are relevant depending on the type of business activity. Of course, I wouldn't ignore psychology (note that economists and finance people don't generally condone the following sort of emotional thinking).  If you don't invest in the company and it goes big, you'll kick yourself.  If it goes really big, other people will either assume you are rich or feel sad for you if you say you didn't get rich.  If you invest but lose money, it may not be so painful as not investing and losing out the opportunity.  So if you consider the emotional aspect of personal finance, it may be wise to invest at least a little, and hedge against \"\"woulda-shoulda\"\" syndrome.  That's more like emotional advice than hard-nosed financial advice. So much of the answer really depends on your particular circumstances.  Obviously you have other considerations like whether you can afford the investment, which will be on you to decide.  And of course, the \u00a7 83(b) election is almost always recommended in these situations (which seems to be what you are saying) to convert ordinary income into capital gain.  You may also need cash to pay any up-front taxes on the \u00a7 83(b) equity, depending on your circumstances.\"",
            "\"I think you need to realize that regardless of whether they are \"\"shady\"\" or not, owners/founders are by and large in it for themselves. You as an employee as just a resource - why should they divulge their finances to you? You won't offend them if you pry and ask for it, but they simply are not going to give you the straight up. They will give you a bare minimum or some song and dance that beats around the bush without actually telling you what you need to know. In regards to whether you should buy the restricted shares: why not? Startups are a gamble anyway. So simply decide how much you're willing to gamble, and spend that much buying some shares. I mean, you're already taking the gamble by accepting a lower salary in exchange for equity which, in all likelihood, will never be worth anything anyway.\""

        "question": "In the US, does getting a loan with a cosigner, help your credit rating?",
        "answer": "In the U.S., getting a loan with a cosigner can indeed affect your credit rating, and the outcome typically can fall into three scenarios:\n\n1. The loan company reports the loan\u2019s status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner. As a result, both individuals get a new account on their credit report. While this may initially drop the credit scores due to a hard credit inquiry and increased debt, over time, if the loan payments are managed well, it can have a positive effect on both parties' credit ratings. This is the expected norm where the credit effect is the same as if each person were the sole signer .\n\n2. The loan company may choose to report the loan under only one individual\u2014probably the cosigner\u2014which means the other will not have this loan reflected on their credit report. This may be done to expedite loan approval or due to an error. In such a scenario, Person A's credit would not be affected .\n\n3. There is also the possibility that the loan company does not report the loan at all to the credit agencies, or does so incorrectly. While they are not obligated to report to credit agencies, if the borrower fails to pay the loan, the company can report it as a collections account. Some companies operate this way, and it should be noted that this practice does not necessarily help build one's credit .\n\nImportantly, loans only affect the credit ratings with the bureaus they are reported to. Since there are multiple credit bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian), and they do not necessarily share information, the loan could impact one credit score but not others.\n\nOverall, it is essential to remember that taking out a loan solely for the purpose of improving one's credit is usually not recommended. Building credit should preferentially be done in ways that do not incur additional costs .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"It all comes down to how the loan itself is structured and reported - the exact details of how they run the loan paperwork, and how/if they report the activity on the loan to one of the credit bureaus (and which one they report to).  It can go generally one of three ways: A) The loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner. In this scenario, both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially this will generally drop related credit scores somewhat (it's a \"\"hard pull\"\", new account with zero history, and increased debt), but over time this can have a positive effect on both people's credit rating. This is the typical scenario one might logically expect to be the norm, and it effects both parties credit just as if they were a sole signor for the loan. And as always, if the loan is not paid properly it will negatively effect both people's credit, and the owner of the loan can choose to come after either or both parties in whatever order they want. B) The loan company just runs the loan with one person, and only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the co-signor), leaving the other as just a backup. If you aren't paying close attention they may even arrange it where the initial party wanting to take the loan isn't even on most of the paperwork. This let the person trying to run the loan get something accepted that might not have been otherwise, or save some time, or was just an error. In this case it will have no effect on Person A's credit. We've had a number of question like this, and this isn't really a rare occurrence. Never assume people selling you things are necessarily accurate or honest - always verify. C) The loan company just doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, or does so incorrectly. They are under no obligation to report to credit agencies, it's strictly up to them. If you don't pay then they can report it as something \"\"in collections\"\". This isn't the typical way of doing business for most places, but some businesses still operate this way, including some places that advertise how doing business with them (paying them grossly inflated interest rates) will \"\"help build your credit\"\". Most advertising fraud goes unpunished. Note: Under all of the above scenarios, the loan can only effect the credit rating attached to the bureau it is reported to. If the loan is reported to Equifax, it will not help you with a TransUnion or Experian rating at all. Some loans report to multiple credit bureaus, but many don't bother, and credit bureaus don't automatically copy each other. It's important to remember that there isn't so much a thing as a singular \"\"consumer credit rating\"\", as there are \"\"consumer credit ratings\"\" - 3 of them, for most purposes, and they can vary widely depending on your reported histories. Also, if it is only a short-term loan of 3-6 months then it is unlikely to have a powerful impact on anyone's credit rating. Credit scores are formulas calibrated to care about long-term behavior, where 3 years of perfect credit history is still considered a short period of time and you will be deemed to have a significant risk of default without more data. So don't expect to qualify for a prime-rate mortgage because of a car loan that was paid off in a few months; it might be enough to give you a score if you don't have one, but don't expect much more. As always, please remember that taking out a loan just to improve credit is almost always a terrible idea. Unless you have a very specific reason with a carefully researched and well-vetted plan that means that it's very important you build credit in this specific way, you should generally focus on establishing credit in ways that don't actually cost you any money at all. Look for no fee credit cards that you pay in full each month, even if you have to start with credit-building secured card plans, and switch to cash-value no-fee rewards cards for a 1-3% if you operate your financial life in a way that this doesn't end up manipulating your purchasing decisions to cost you money. Words to the wise: \"\"Don't let the credit score tail wag the personal financial dog!\"\"\""

It's recommended to avoid funds that invest in the company you're trying to avoid, as well as companies that own portions of it or buy their products or services .\n\n3. **Consider the Financial Impact**: Selling a stock short that you own via a fund should theoretically have the same financial effect as not owning the stock. This might work for your personal finances and potentially has implications for the stock's price due to market behaviors. However, this is a complex strategy and its practical execution might not be straightforward or effective .\n\n4. **Donate to Charity**: A more straightforward and ethical approach mentioned is to calculate the proportion of your investment in the \"bad\" companies and donate an equivalent amount to charity. This may not exclude the stock from your mutual fund holdings, but it can mitigate the ethical concern by supporting a cause that counters the impact of the unwanted investment .\n\nIt's important to note that mutual funds are pooled investments managed based on certain objectives outlined in their prospectus, and individual investors do not have direct control over the specific stocks included. If excluding specific stocks from your investment portfolio is a priority, it may be necessary to invest directly in individual stocks or look for specialized funds that align with your criteria.",

You'll spend more money to avoid the shares than these very shares are worth.  Your proposal is interesting but impractical. In a portfolio of say $100K in the S&P, the bottom 400 stocks are disproportionately smaller amounts of money in those shares than the top 100. So we're talking $100 or less.

            "Owning a stock via a fund and selling it short simultaneously should have the same net financial effect as not owning the stock.  This should work both for your personal finances as well as the impact of (not) owning the shares has on the stock's price. To use an extreme example, suppose there are 4 million outstanding shares of Evil Oil Company.  Suppose a group of concerned index fund investors owns 25% of the stock and sells short the same amount.   They've borrowed someone else's 25% of the company and sold it to a third party.  It should have the same effect as selling their own shares of the company, which they can't otherwise do.  Now when 25% of the company's stock becomes available for purchase at market price, what happens to the stock?  It falls, of course.   Regarding how it affects your own finances, suppose the stock price rises and the investors have to return the shares to the lender.  They buy 1 million shares at market price, pushing the stock price up, give them back, and then sell another million shares short, subsequently pushing the stock price back down. If enough people do this to effect the share price of a stock or asset class, the managers at the companies might be forced into behaving in a way that satisfies the investors.  In your case, perhaps the company could issue a press release and fire the employee that tried to extort money from your wife's estate in order to win your investment business back.

You might be eligible for help through a federal, state, or lender program. It is also noted that some lenders will work with you if you contact them early and openly discuss your situation.

            "I would say generally, the answer is No.   There might be some short term relief to people in certain situations, but generally speaking you sign a contract to borrow money and you are responsible to pay.  This is why home loans offer better terms then auto loans, and auto loans better than credit cards or things like furniture.  The better terms offer less risk to the lender because there are assets that can be repossessed.  Homes retain values better than autos, autos better than furniture, and credit cards are not secured at all. People are not as helpless as your question suggests.  Sure a person might lose their high paying job, but could they still make a mortgage payment if they worked really hard at it?  This might mean taking several part time jobs.  Now if a person buys a home that has a very large mortgage payment this might not be possible.  However, wise people don't buy every bit of house they can afford.   People should also be wise about the kinds of mortgages they use to buy a home.  Many people lost their homes due to missing a payment on their interest only loan.  Penalty rates and fees jacked up their payment, that was way beyond their means.  If they had a fixed rate loan the chance to catch up would have not been impossible. Perhaps an injury might prevent a person from working.  This is why long term disability insurance is a must for most people.  You can buy quite a bit of coverage for not very much money. Typical US households have quite a bit of debt.  Car payments, phone payments, and either a mortgage or rent, and of course credit cards.  If income is drastically reduced making all of those payments becomes next to impossible.  Which one gets paid first.  Just this last week, I attempted to help a client in just this situation.  They foolishly chose to pay the credit card first, and were going to pay the house payment last (if there was anything left over).  There wasn't, and they are risking eviction (renters).     People finding themselves in crisis, generally do a poor job of paying the most important things first.  Basic food first, housing and utilities second, etc...  Let the credit card slip if need be no matter how often one is threatened by creditors.  They do this to maintain their credit score, how foolish. I feel like you have a sense of bondage associated with debt.  It is there and real despite many people noticing it.

            "For insight on what will happen, I suggest looking at the situation from the lender's perspective: If your setbacks are temporary, and you are likely to get back on your feet again, they will protect their investment by making accommodations, and probably charging you extra fees along the way. If your financial hardship seems irredeemable, they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible, and then eventually take your house, protecting their investment as best they can. If they are going to foreclose, they may be reluctant to do it quickly, as foreclosure is expensive, takes man power, and looks bad on their books.  So it may get pushed off for a Quarter, or a fiscal year. But if you are asking if they'll help you out from the goodness of their heart, well, a bank has no heart, and creditors are interested in ROI.  They'll take the easiest path to profit, or failing that, the path to minimum financial losses.   The personal consequences to you are not their concern. Once you realize this, it may change your thinking about your own situation.   If you think you have a path to financial recovery, then you need to make that clear to them, in writing, with details.  Make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests. If you cannot make such a case, recognize that they'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties, fees, interest payments, etc, before eventually foreclosing on you anyway.  Don't play that game. If your home is a lost cause financially, plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible.

The larger and more corporate the lender, the less likely you'll find one that will work with you. My experience is that your success in working out repayment plan for missed payments depends on the duration of your reduced income.  If this is a period of unemployment and you will be able to pay again in a number of months, you may be able to work out a plan on some debts. If you're permanently unable to pay in full, or the duration is too long, you may have to file bankruptcy to save your domicile and transportation.  The ethics of this go beyond this forum, as do the specifics of when it is advisable to file bankruptcy. Research your area, find debt counselling.  They can really help with specifics.  Speak with your lenders, they may be able to refer you to local non-profit services.  Be sure that you find one of those, not one of the predatory lenders posing as credit counselling services.  There's even some that take the money you can afford to pay, divide it up over your creditors, allowing you to keep accruing late/partial payment fees, and charge you a fee on top of it.  To me this is fraudulent and should be cause for criminal charges. The key is open communication with your lenders with disclosure to the level that they need to know.

        "question": "How can I buy and sell the same stock on the same day?",
        "answer": "To buy and sell the same stock on the same day, you would be engaging in what's commonly referred to as \"day trading.\" The process involves closely watching the stock price movements and executing trades to take advantage of short-term gains. Here's a basic overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. **Open a Brokerage Account**: You need a brokerage account capable of day trading. Some brokerage accounts have restrictions on day trading, so ensure your account allows it.\n\n2. **Understand Day Trading Rules**: In some jurisdictions, there are specific rules for day trading. For example, in the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has the \"Pattern Day Trader\" rule, which imposes certain minimum equity requirements on day traders.\n\n3. **Buy the Stock**: Place an order to buy shares of the stock you're interested in. This can be a market order, which is executed at the current market price, or a limit order, where you set the maximum price you're willing to pay for the share.\n\n4. **Monitor the Market**: After buying the shares, you\u2019ll need to monitor the stock's price movement closely. Day traders usually use technical analysis tools and charts to predict how a stock price may move.\n\n5. **Sell the Stock**: When you feel that you have achieved the desired gain or wish to cut losses, you can place an order to sell the stock. Like buying, this can be a market order or a limit order based on the price you wish to receive.\n\n6. **Completing the Trades**: Both the buy and sell orders need to be executed on the same day to qualify as a day trade.\n\nRemember that day trading involves significant risk, including the potential for rapid financial losses. It requires careful analysis and a well-thought-out strategy. Additionally, there can be tax implications, and depending on your jurisdiction, you may be subject to different rules, such as wash sale rules and the need to consider short-term capital gains taxes .\n\nPlease note, if you're interested in selling short as mentioned in the examples of the documents, this involves selling borrowed stocks with the intention of buying them back later at a lower price to pocket the difference as a profit.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of the costs associated with day trading, such as brokerage fees and any borrowing fees if you're selling short. It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor or a trading expert to understand the full scope and risks before you begin day trading.",

            "\"Because it takes 3 business days for the actual transfer of stock to occur after you buy or sell to the next owner, your cash is tied up until that happens. This is called the settlement period. Therefore, brokers offer \"\"margin\"\", which is a form of credit, or loan, to allow you to keep trading while the settlement period occurs, and in other situations unrelated to the presented question. To do this you need a \"\"margin account\"\", you currently have a \"\"cash account\"\". The caveat of having a retail margin account (distinct from a professional margin account) is that there is a limited amount of same-day trades you can make if you have less than $25,000 in the account. This is called the Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule. You don't need $25k to day trade, you will just wish you had it, as it is easy to get your account frozen or downgraded to a cash account. The way around THAT is to have multiple margin accounts at different brokerages. This will greatly increase the number of same day trades you can make. Many brokers that offer a \"\"solution\"\" to PDT to people that don't have 25k to invest, are offering professional trading accounts, which have additional fees for data, which is free for retail trading accounts. This problem has nothing to do with:  So be careful of the advice you get on the internet. It is mostly white noise. Feel free to verify\"",
            "You should not have to wait 3 days to sell the stock after purchase. If you are trading with a cash account you will have to wait for the sale to settle (3 business days) before you can use those funds to purchase other stock. If you meet the definition of a pattern day trader which is 4 or more day trades in 5 business days then your brokerage will require you to have a minimum of $25,000 in funds and a margin account.",
            "\"If you're going to be a day trader, you really need to know your stuff.  It's risky, to say the least. One of the most important elements to being successful is having access to very fast data streams so that you can make moves quickly as trends stat to develop in the markets.  If you're planning on doing this using consumer-grade sites like eTrade, that's not a good idea.  The web systems of many of the retail brokerage firms are not good enough to give you data fast enough for you to make good, timely decisions or to be able to execute trades way that day traders do in order to make their money.  Many of those guys are living on very thin margins, sometimes just a few cents of movement one way or the other, so they make up for it with a large volume of trades. One of the reasons you were told you need a big chunk of money to day trade is that some firms will rent you out a \"\"desk\"\" and computer access to day trade through their systems if you're really serious about it.  They will require you to put up at least a minimum amount of money for this privilege, and $25k may not be too far out of the ballpark. If you've never done day trading before, be careful.  It doesn't take much to get caught looking the wrong way on a trade that you can't get out of without losing your shirt unless you're willing to hold on to the stock, which could be longer than a day. Day trading sounds very simple and easy, but it isn't.  You need to learn about how it works (a good book to read to understand this market is \"\"Flash Boys\"\" by Michael Lewis, besides being very entertaining), because it is a space filled with very sophisticated, well-funded firms and individuals who spend huge sums of money to gain miniscule advantages in the markets. Be careful, whatever you do.  And don't play in day trading with your retirement money or any other money you can't afford to walk away from. I hope this helps. Good luck!\"",

        "question": "My previous and current employers both use Fidelity for 401(k). Does it make sense to rollover?",
        "answer": "When considering whether to roll over your 401(k) from a previous employer to your current employer's plan, there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Investment Options:** Compare the investment options and their associated fees in both the old and new 401(k) plans. If the current employer's plan offers better investment choices or lower fees, rolling over might be beneficial.\n\n2. **Fees:** Plans can have different administrative fees and management costs. Review both plans to understand the costs associated with each.\n\n3. **Plan Features:** Some plans may offer unique features such as loans or particular investment advice services; consider whether these are important to you.\n\n4. **Simplicity:** Consolidating multiple accounts can make managing your retirement savings simpler and give you a better view of your overall financial picture.\n\n5. **Rules and Regulations:** There might be differences in rules regarding loans, withdrawals, and distributions.\n\n6. **Protection from Creditors:** Generally, 401(k) plans are protected from creditors, but it's always a good idea to confirm if any changes might affect this protection.\n\n7. **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** If you continue to work beyond the age of 72, you may be able to delay taking RMDs from your current employer's plan, but not from your old plan.\n\n8. **Rollover Process:** Understand the rollover process and make sure no mistakes are made that could lead to unnecessary taxes or penalties.\n\n9. **Employer Stock:** If your former plan includes employer stock, consider the tax implications of rolling over this investment.\n\n10. **Advice from a Financial Professional:** It's often a good idea to seek advice from a financial advisor or tax professional who knows your personal financial situation.\n\nThe decision to roll over your 401(k) is personal and should be made based on your unique financial situation, goals, and the specifics of your plans. If you would like, I can check for any specific guidance on rollovers from your 401(k) plan documents, if you have provided those. Would you like me to look into that for you?",
        "ground_truth": [
            "I would check to see what the fee schedule is on your previous employer's 401k. Depending on how it was setup, the quarterly/annual maintenance fee may be lower/higher than your current employer. Another reason to rollover/not-rollover is that selection of funds available is better than the other plan. And of course always consider rolling over your old plan into a standard custodial rollover IRA where the management company gives you a selection of investment options. At least look at the fees and expense ratios of your prior employer's plan and see if anything reaches a threshold of what you consider actionable and worth your time. Note: removed reference to self directed IRA as vehicle is more complicated account type allowing for more than just stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Not for your typical retail investor.",
            "I would always suggest rolling over 401(k) plans to traditional IRAs when possible.  Particularly, assuming there is enough money in them that you can get a fee-free account at somewhere like Fidelity or Vanguard.  This is for a couple of reasons. First off, it opens up your investment choices significantly and can allow you significantly reduced expenses related to the account.  You may be able to find a superior offering from Vanguard or Fidelity to what your employer's 401(k) plan allows; typically they only allow a small selection of funds to choose from.  You also may be able to reduce the overhead fees, as many 401(k) plans charge you an administrative fee for being in the plan separate from the funds' costs. Second, it allows you to condense 401(k)s over time; each time you change employers, you can rollover your 401(k) to your regular IRA and not have to deal with a bunch of different accounts with different passwords and such.  Even if they're all at the same provider, odds are you will have to use separate accounts. Third, it avoids issues if your employer goes out of business.  While 401(k) plans are generally fully funded (particularly for former employers who you don't have match or vesting concerns with), it can be a pain sometimes when the plan is terminated to access your funds - they may be locked for months while the bankruptcy court works things out. Finally, employers sometimes make it expensive for you to stay in - particularly if you do have a very small amount.  Don't assume you're allowed to stay in the former employer's 401(k) plan fee-free; the plan will have specific instructions for what to do if you change employers, and it may include being required to leave the plan - or more often, it could increase the fees associated with the plan if you stay in.  Getting out sometimes will save you significantly, even with a low-cost plan."

        "answer": "If you're looking to manage your paper financial documents effectively, the following suggestions from the file you provided may be helpful:\n\n1. Consider scanning your financial documents if you're not ready to part with them. This will help you create digital copies that can be stored and accessed easily when needed. \n\n2. Sign up for eStatements with your financial providers. Most financial institutions encourage this as it reduces their expenses. Moreover, eStatements are convenient, environmentally friendly, and can help reduce paper clutter.\n\n3. Prune your paper documents to remove unnecessary pages like terms and conditions, advertisements, etc. Also, you might consider consolidating your statements. For example, you can discard monthly statements when you receive the quarterly ones, and toss the quarterly ones upon receiving the annual summary, which helps keep your records streamlined.\n\n4. You can also use digital storage solutions like Google Docs for keeping your financial documents, provided you're comfortable with the level of security and privacy they offer. However, if you are in a heavily regulated profession or have privacy concerns, take extra precautions about where and how you store your sensitive documents .\n\nPlease note that while this advice can help you manage your paper financial documents, it's also important to keep the security of your information in mind and to ensure that you have backups for important documents.",

If you still like having paper around (I do admit that it's comforting in a way) then you can usually prune your paper a bit by statement (getting rid of T&C boilerplate, advertisements, etc.) or by consolidation (toss monthly when the quarterly consolidation statement arrives; toss the quarterly when the yearly arrives).",

        "question": "Short selling - lender's motivation",
        "answer": "The motivation for lenders in the context of short selling stems from the nature of the short selling transaction itself. Short selling is a cash transaction where a short seller borrows shares to sell them to the buyer, who then takes immediate delivery and all the rights that come with share ownership, including entitlement to dividends and the right to vote at shareholder meetings. If the short seller has not borrowed the shares but still sells them, the buyer would not have the rights associated with ownership, which the market does not allow as it is based on actual delivery and ownership transfer.\n\nAllowing short sellers to sell shares they have not borrowed could result in selling more shares than actually exist, distorting prices and disadvantaging existing shareholders. When short sellers who haven't borrowed shares sell, they could end up paying more in dividends to the buyers than the dividends paid by the underlying company.\n\nTherefore, the lender's motivation for participating in short selling transactions includes receiving compensation for lending the shares, which could be in the form of a lending fee or other financial incentives. They also provide a service that helps maintain market liquidity and efficiency while earning from the assets they lend without having to sell them outright.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Oftentimes, the lender (the owner of the security) is not explicitly involved in the lending transaction. Let's say the broker is holding a long-term position of 1MM shares from Client A. It is common for Client A's agreement with Broker A to include a clause that allows the broker to lend out the 1MM shares for its own profit (\"\"rehypothecation\"\"). Client A may be compensated for this in some form (e.g. baked into their financing rates), but they do not receive any compensation that is directly tied to lending activities. You also have securities lending agents that lend securities for an explicit fee. For example, the borrower's broker may not have sufficient inventory, in which case they would need to find a third-party lending agent. This happens both on-demand as well as for a fixed-terms (typically a large basket of securities). SLB (securities lending and borrowing) is a business in its own right.  I'm not sure I follow your follow-up question but oftentimes there is no restriction that prevents the broker from lending out shares \"\"for a very short time\"\". Unless there is a transaction-based fee though, the number of times you lend shares does not affect \"\"pocketing the interest\"\" since interest accrues as a function of time.\"",
            "\"As the other answer said, the person who owns the lent stock does not benefit directly.  They may benefit indirectly in that brokers can use the short lending profits to reduce their fees or in that they have the option to short other stocks at the same terms.   Follow-up question: what prevents the broker lending the shares for a very short time (less than a day), pocketing the interest and returning the lenders their shares without much change in share price (because borrowing period was very short). What prevents them from doing that many times a day ? Lack of market.   Short selling for short periods of time isn't so common as to allow for \"\"many\"\" times a day.  Some day traders may do it occasionally, but I don't know that it would be a reliable business model to supply them.  If there are enough people interested in shorting the stock, they will probably want to hold onto it long enough for the anticipated movement to happen.   There are transaction costs here.  Both fees for trading at all and the extra charges for short sale borrowing and interest.  Most stocks do not move down by large enough amounts \"\"many\"\" times a day.  Their fluctuations are smaller.  If the stock doesn't move enough to cover the transaction fees, then that seller lost money overall.  Over time, sellers like that will stop trading, as they will lose all their money.   All that said, there are no legal blocks to loaning the stock out many times, just practical ones.  If a stock was varying wildly for some bizarre reason, it could happen.\""

        "question": "Should you always max out contributions to your 401k?",
        "answer": "Maxing out contributions to a 401(k) is generally advised by many investing professionals as a very common piece of advice due to the tax advantages, the potential employer matching contributions, and the benefits of compounding over time. However, there are several important considerations prior to deciding to fully fund your 401(k):\n\n1. Company Match: Always contribute at least enough to get the full company match, if available, as this is equivalent to an immediate return on your investment that is hard to beat elsewhere .\n\n2. Emergency Fund: Make sure to have an emergency fund equivalent to at least six months of basic living expenses before heavily contributing to a 401(k), since it is undesirable to withdraw from your 401(k) before retirement due to potential penalties and taxes .\n\n3. High-Interest Debt: Pay off high-interest debt, like credit card debt, first. The interest you save by paying down this debt is akin to earning a risk-free return equal to the interest rate of the debt .\n\n4. Tax Considerations: Be aware that contributions to a traditional 401(k) can lower your taxable income now, which may be beneficial if you are currently in a high tax bracket. However, if you believe you'll be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, investing in a Roth IRA or 401(k) might be more advantageous since it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement .\n\n5. Personal Investment Strategy: If you are a sophisticated investor who can responsibly manage and invest money outside of a 401(k) plan, it may be more beneficial to save the income for other investments. On the other hand, if you aren't as disciplined or knowledgeable about investing, the structure and tax benefits of a 401(k) might make more sense for you .\n\n6. Income Level and Tax Brackets: Consider if you can save enough to lower your current tax bracket by contributing to a 401(k), and whether contributing to a Roth account after hitting a certain income level might be a better strategy given your circumstances .\n\nIn conclusion, while the advice to max out your 401(k) as much as possible is widespread, it's not a one-size-fits-all recommendation. You should consider your current financial situation, debt levels, emergency savings, tax considerations, company match policies, and personal investment capabilities before deciding to maximize your 401(k) contributions.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "To be clear, a 401K is a vehicle, you make investments WITHIN it, if you choose poorly such as say putting all your money into company stock when working for the next Enron, you can still get hurt badly.  So it is important to have diversity and an appropriate risk level based on your age, tolerance for risk, etc. That said, as vehicles go it is outstanding, and the 'always max your 401K' is very very common advice for a large number of investing professionals, CFA's, pundits, etc.  That said there are a few priorities to consider here. First priority, if there is some level of company matching, grab that, it's hard to beat that kind of 'return' in almost any other case. Second, since you never want to tap into a 401K (if you can at all avoid it) before you are ready to retire, you should first be sure you have a good 'emergency fund' set aside in the event you lose your job, or some other major catastrophy happens.  Many recommend setting aside at least 6 months of basic living expenses.   Third, if you have any high interest debt (like credit card debt) pay that stuff down as fast as you can.  You'll save a ton of interest (it's pretty much the same as investing the money you use to pay it down, and getting a return equal to the interest rate you are paying, with zero risk.. can't be beat.  You'll also end up with a lot better cash flow, and the ability to start saving first and spending out of savings, so you earn interest instead of paying it. Once you have those things out of the way, then it is time to think about fully funding the  401K.  and keep in mind, since you don't pay taxes on it, the 'felt effect' to you pocket is about 80% or even less, of what goes into the account, so it's not as painful as you might think, and the hit to your take home may be less than you'd expect.  Contributing as much as you can, as early as you can also lets you benefit from the effect of compounding, and has a far larger affect on the balance than money put into the account closer to retirement.  So if you can afford to max it out, I surely would advise you to do so.",
            "I think better advice would be always max out your 401K at least to the level that the company provides a match. For example, my company will match 50% up to 10% of your salary. Good luck finding another investment with a guaranteed immediate 50% return. Beyond the company match, it is probably good advice to put as much in the 401K as you can afford if you aren't disciplined enough to invest that money on your own. Otherwise it depends on a number of factors as to whether it is better to invest on your own or in the company plan.",
            "A terrific resource is this article. To summarize the points given: PROS: CONS: There is no generic yes or no answer as to whether you ought to max out your 401(k)s. If you are a sophisticated investor, then saving the income for investing could be a better alternative. Long term capital gains are taxed at 15% in the US, so if you buy and hold on to good companies that reinvest their earnings, then the share price keeps going up and you'll save a lot of money that would go in taxes.  If you're not a very good investor, however, then 401(k)s make a lot of sense. If you're going to end up setting up some asset allocation and buying ETFs and rebalancing or having a  manager rebalance for you every year or so, then you might as well take the 401(k) option and lower your taxable income.  Point #1 is simply wrong, because companies that reinvest earnings and growing for a long time are essentially creating tax-free gains for you, which is even better than tax-deferred gains. Nonetheless, most people have neither the time nor the interest to research companies and for them, the 401(k) makes more sense.",
            "As long as you're in a lower tax bracket - you would probably be better off paying the taxes now, and investing into the Roth IRA/401K. However, you should be investing for your retirement now, and not later, because of the compounding effect, and also you'll gain the employer matching (if available).",
            "The compound interest argument is a good one.  While you are young, it is important to save, since time is on your side for compounding of interest.  I think the 401K is a good idea, but not for all of your savings.  Think about saving a percentage of your income, but put it in a couple places. Your Roth is also a great thing, since you'll be able to remove money without paying tax again.  The 401k (tax deferred) is a good idea if your company matches any of it (FREE MONEY!), and because it lowers your taxable income now, and it's taken out of your check before you see it, so you don't miss it.  It's still important to save other money that you can have for ready cash (unexpected dead car, for example, or medical bills, or what have you.) I find that I don't want to be managing my investments from minute to minute, or doing my own trades (I'd rather do other things), so I have a mix (Roth, 401k, cash savings) of automated contributions for savings, and I think hard before buying new stuff.  The point is to save, and if possible, try to save at least 10% of your income.",
            "\"First, the limit this year is $16,500, $22,000 for age 50 or older. Next, does the company give you any match? If so, how much? Some will match your deposits dollar for dollar up to a certain percent of your pay. If you make $50k and deposit say 6%, that's $3k matched by company, for example. This deposit/match is the first priority.  Next, you should understand the expenses in the account. A bad 401(k) with high cost quickly negates any tax deferral benefit. The 401(k) options also may be limited, what are the choices of investments?  Is your income high enough that you can save $21,500? One thought is to save enough to drop back out of the 25% bracket, and go Roth after that. This is a good balance for most. By the way, Fairmark is a great site to see what bracket you are in. If your return is simple, you can just find your standard deduction and exemption numbers and get to your taxable income very simply. The debate of of Roth vs Pretax (for both IRA and 401(k) accounts) can get pretty complex, but I found the majority of earners falling into the \"\"live in the 15% bracket, tops\"\" range.\"",
            "Rule of thumb: Invest in a tax deferred account only if your marginal tax rate is higher now than it will be in retirement. If you plan on making more taxable income in retirement than you do right now, then you should invest outside a tax deferred account.",
            "My observations is that this seems like hardly enough to kill   inflation. Is he right? Or are there better ways to invest? The tax deferral part of the equation isn't what dominates regarding whether your 401k beats 30 years of inflation; it is the return on investment.  If your 401k account tanks due to a prolonged market crash just as you retire, then you might have been better off stashing the money in the bank.  Remember, 401k money at now + 30 years is not a guaranteed return (though many speak as though it were).  There is also the question as to whether fees will eat up some of your return and whether the funds your 401k invests in are good ones. I'm uneasy with the autopilot nature of the typical 401k non-strategy; it's too much the standard thing to do in the U.S., it's too unconscious, and strikes me as Ponzi-like.  It has been a winning strategy for some already, sure, and maybe it will work for the next 30-100 years or more.  I just don't know.  There are also changes in policy or other unknowns that 30 years will bring, so it takes faith I don't have to lock away a large chunk of my savings in something I can't touch without hassle and penalty until then. For that reason, I have contributed very little to my 403b previously, contribute nothing now (though employer does, automatically.  I have no match.) and have built up a sizable cash savings, some of which may be used to start a business or buy a house with a small or no mortgage (thereby guaranteeing at least not paying mortgage interest).  I am open to changing my mind about all this, but am glad I've been able to at least save a chunk to give me some options that I can exercise in the next 5-10 years if I want, instead of having to wait 25 or more.",
            "While tax deferral is a nice feature, the 401k is not the Holy Grail.  I've seen plenty of 401k's where the investment options are horrible: sub-par performance, high fees, limited options.   That's great that you've maxed out your Roth IRA.  I commend you for that.   As long as the investment options in your 401k are good, then I would stick with it.",
            "Definitely not.  You are too young.  Let me explain: Your money will be locked up for at least 40 years, and you will have to navigate some really quirky and trap-laden rules in order to get money for simple things.  Let's say you want to buy a house.  You won't be able to leverage the 401K for that.  College Tuition?  Limits. Your money is locked in and you may get some match, but that assumes your smartest decision at your age is to save money for retirement.  At your age, you should be investing in your career, and that requires cash at hand.  If you want to withdraw early you pay more of a penalty than just the tax rate.   Put differently: investing in your human capital, at a young age, can yield stronger results than just squirreling money.  I'd say don't worry until you are 30. BTW: I'm 24 now.  I used to save money in a 401K for a few months, before I understood the rules.  Since then, I decided against 401K and just saved the money in a bank.  After a few years, I had enough to start my business :)  the 401K couldn't give me that opportunity. Further Explanation: I am in the NYC area.  Many of my friends and I had to decide between living in manhattan or choosing to live in the outer boroughs or NJ.  One thing I noticed was that, while the people in manhattan were burning much more money (to the tune of 1500 per month), they were actually much more productive and were promoted more often.  Having lived in brooklyn and in manhattan, even though it is less expensive, you actually lose at least an hour a day thanks to the commute (and have to deal with crap like the 6 train).  Personally, after moving in, I invested the extra time in myself (i.e. sleeping more, working longer hours, side projects).  Now, when all is said and done, the people who decided to invest in themselves in the short term are financially more secure (both job-wise and economically, thanks to a few bonus cycles) than those who decided to save on rent and put it in a 401K. As far as the traps are concerned, my dad tried to take out a student loan and was denied thanks to a Vanguard quirk which didnt allow more than 50K to be borrowed (even though the account had over 500K to begin with)."

        "question": "Shorting Stocks And Margin Account Minimum",
        "answer": "When shorting stocks, you are essentially selling shares that you do not currently own with the expectation that the stock price will drop in the future, allowing you to buy them back at a lower price and profit from the difference. In the example provided in the text, if you short sell 200 shares at $20 each and later repurchase them at $19 each, your profit would be $200 (excluding any interest or fees). Short selling is considered a high-risk strategy because while your gain is limited to the price at which you shorted the shares (your theoretical maximum gain is if the stock drops to $0), your potential loss is unlimited since there is no cap on how high the stock price might rise .\n\nThe margin account minimum refers to the initial margin which is essentially a \"good faith\" deposit required by the broker as a guarantee that you can cover any potential losses. This initial margin isn't deducted from your cash account; it's segregated to ensure you can't use these funds for other trading activity. Once you close out your short position, these funds are released from segregation.\n\nAdditionally, there is a second type of margin called variation margin which reflects the running profit or loss on the short position. The initial margin and variation margin are netted to determine the total margin requirement, which is recalculated at the close of each trading day. If you incur a loss, you may be required to deposit additional funds to maintain the margin requirement. Conversely, if you show a profit, some of the margin may be released . \n\nAlways remember that the specifics of margin requirements can vary between different brokers and regulatory environments, so you should check with your brokerage firm for the most accurate and up-to-date requirements.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"First, you are not exactly \"\"giving\"\" the brokerage $2000. That money is the margin requirement to protect them in the case the stock price rises. If you short 200 shares as in your example and they are holding $6000 from you then they are protected in the event of the stock price increasing to $30/share. Sometime before it gets there the brokerage will require you to deposit more money or they will cover your position by repurchasing the shares for your account. The way you make money on the short sale is if the stock price declines. It is a buy low sell high idea but in reverse. If you believe that prices are going to drop then you could sell now when it is high and buy back later when it is lower. In your example, you are selling 200 shares at $20 and later, buying those at $19. Thus, your profit is $200, not counting any interest or fees you have paid. It's a bit confusing because you are selling something you'll buy in the future. Selling short is usually considered quite risky as your gain is limited to the amount that you sold at initially (if I sell at $20/share the most I can make is if the stock declines to $0).  Your potential to lose is unlimited in theory. There is no limit to how high the stock could go in theory so I could end up buying it back at an infinitely high price. Neither of these extremes are likely but they do show the limits of your potential gain and loss.  I used $20/share for simplicity assuming you are shorting with a market order vs a limit order. If you are shorting it would be better for you to sell at 20 instead of 19 anyway. If someone says I would like to give you $20 for that item you are selling you aren't likely to tell them \"\"no, I'd really only like $19 for it\"\"\"",
            "\"The margin money you put up to fund a short position ($6000 in the example given) is simply a \"\"good faith\"\" deposit that is required by the broker in order to show that you are acting in good faith and fully intend to meet any potential losses that may occur.  This margin is normally called initial margin.  It is not an accounting item, meaning it is not debited from you cash account.  Rather, the broker simply segregates these funds so that you may not use them to fund other trading.  When you settle your position these funds are released from segregation.   In addition, there is a second type of margin, called variation margin, which must be maintained while holding a short position.  The variation margin is simply the running profit or loss being incurred on the short position.  In you example, if you sold 200 shares at $20 and the price went to $21, then your variation margin would be a debit of $200, while if the price went to $19, the variation margin would be a credit of $200.   The variation margin will be netted with the initial margin to give the total margin requirement ($6000 in this example).  Margin requirements are computed at the close of business on each trading day.  If you are showing a loss of $200 on the variation margin, then you will be required to put up an additional $200 of margin money in order to maintain the $6000 margin requirement - ($6000 - $200 = $5800, so you must add $200 to maintain $6000).  If you are showing a profit of $200, then $200 will be released from segregation - ($6000 + $200 = $6200, so $200 will be release from segregation leaving $6000 as required). When you settle your short position by buying back the shares, the margin monies will be release from segregation and the ledger postings to you cash account will be made according to whether you have made a profit or a loss.  So if you made a loss of $200 on the trade, then your account will be debited for $200 plus any applicable commissions.  If you made a profit of $200 on the trade then your account will be credited with $200 and debited with any applicable commissions.\"",
            "\"And what exactly do I profit from the short? I understand it is the difference in the value of the stock. So if my initial investment was $4000 (200 * $20) and I bought it at $3800 (200 * $19) I profit from the difference, which is $200. Do I also receive back the extra $2000 I gave the bank to perform the trade? Either this is extremely poorly worded or you misunderstand the mechanics of a short position.  When you open a short position, your are expecting that the stock will decline from here.  In a short position you are borrowing shares you don't own and selling them.  If the price goes down you get to buy the same shares back for less money and return them to the person you borrowed from.  Your profit is the delta between the original sell price and the new lower buy price (less commissions and fees/interest).  Opening and closing a short position is two trades, a sell then a buy.  Just like a long trade there is no maximum holding period. If you place your order to sell (short) 200 shares at $19, your initial investment is $3,800.   In order to open your $3,800 short position your broker may require your account to have at least $5,700 (according to the 1.5 ratio in your question).  It's not advisable to open a short position this close to the ratio requirement.  Most brokers require a buffer in your account in case the stock goes up, because in a short trade if the stock goes up you're losing money.  If the stock goes up such that you've exhausted your buffer you'll receive what's known as a \"\"margin call\"\" where your broker either requires you to wire in more money or sell part or all of your position at a loss to avoid further losses.  And remember, you may be charged interest on the value of the shares you're borrowing. When you hold a position long your maximum loss is the money you put in; a position can only fall to zero (though you may owe interest or other fees if you're trading on margin).  When you hold a position short your maximum loss is unlimited; there's no limit to how high the value of something can go.  There are less risky ways to make short trades by using put options, but you should ensure that you have a firm grasp on what's happening before you use real money. The timing of the trades and execution of the trades is no different than when you take a plain vanilla long position.  You place your order, either market or limit or whatever, and it executes when your trade criteria occurs.\""

Like you -- and I presume like most people -- I have certain recurring bills: the mortgage, insurance payments, car payment, etc. I simply enter these into the checkbook program about a month before the bill is due. Then I can run a transaction list that shows the date, amount, and remaining balance after each transaction. So if I want to know how much money I really have available to spend, I just look for the last transaction before my next payday, and see what the balance will be on that day. Personally, I always keep a certain amount of pad in my account so if I made a mistake and entered an incorrect amount for a check, or forgot to enter one completely, I don't overdraw the account. (I like to keep $1000 in such padding but that's way more than really necessary, it's very rare that I make a mistake of more than $100.) In my case, I don't enter electric bills or heating bills because I don't know the amount until I get the bill, and the amounts fall well within my padding, and for just two bills I can factor them in in my head. BTW I wrote this program myself but I'm sure there are similar products on the market. I used to use a spreadsheet and that worked pretty well. (Mainly I wrote the program because I have a tiny side business that I have to keep tax records for even though it makes almost no money.) You could in principle do it on paper, but the catch to that is that when you write payments on your paper ledger in advance of actually writing the check, you will often be writing down payments out of order, and so it becomes difficult to see what your balance is or was or will be on any given date. But a computer system can easily accept transactions out of order and then sort them and re-do the balance calculations in a fraction of a second."

        "question": "What is the rough estimate of salary value for a taxpayer to pay AMT?",
        "answer": "The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is designed to ensure that individuals who have substantial income, even after taking advantage of certain deductions, still pay a minimal level of federal income tax. According to the document provided, for the year 2015, the AMT exemption amounts were $53,600 for individual taxpayers, $83,400 for married taxpayers filing jointly and surviving spouses, and $41,700 for married persons filing separately. These amounts are what you're allowed to deduct from your taxable income before applying the AMT. It's worth noting that these amounts can be adjusted annually for inflation, so you may want to check the most current figures from a reliable source like the IRS website or a tax professional for the latest information.\n\nAMT is calculated separately from regular income tax and applies if the AMT is higher than your regular tax liability. In practice, AMT may affect you if your income is above the exemption and you have deductions that are allowed for regular tax purposes but disallowed for AMT purposes. For example, if you have $60,000 in income and $60,000 in specific deductions (which would result in zero regular tax due to your taxable income being zero), AMT would still require you to pay some tax on your income above the minimum threshold, potentially amounting to a few thousand dollars .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Alternative Minimum Tax is based not just on your income, but moreso on the deductions you use. In short, if you have above the minimum AMT threshold of income (54k per your link), and pay a tiny amount of tax, you will pay AMT. AMT is used as an overall protection for the government to say \"\"okay, you can use these deductions from your taxable income, but if you're making a lot of money, you should pay something, no matter what your deductions are\"\". This extra AMT can be used to reduce your tax payment in a future year, if you pay regular tax again. For example - if you have 60k in income, but have 60k in specific deductions from your income, you will pay zero regular tax [because your taxable income will be zero]. AMT would require you to pay some tax on your income above the minimum 54k threshold, which might work out to a few thousand bucks. Next year, if you have 60k in income, but only 15k in deductions, then you would pay some regular tax, and would be able to offset that regular tax by claiming a credit from your AMT already paid.  AMT is really a pre-payment of tax paid in years when you have a lot of deductions. Unless you have a lot of deductions every single year, in which case you might not be able to get all of your AMT refunded in the end. Wikipedia has a pretty good summary of AMT in the US, here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_minimum_tax.  If you think AMT is unfair (and maybe in some cases you might pay it when you think it's \"\"unfair\"\"), look at the root causes of paying AMT listed in that Wikipedia article: I am not trying to convince you that AMT is fair, just that it applies only when someone already has a very low tax rate due to deductions. If you have straight salary income, it would only apply in rare scenarios.\"",

        "question": "How to work around the Owner Occupancy Affidavit to buy another home in less than a year?",
        "answer": "When you close on a mortgage for a primary residence, signing an owner occupancy affidavit typically affirms your intention to use the property as your main residence. However, these affidavits affirm an intention, not a guarantee. Circumstances can change, and if they do, homeowners generally face no penalty as long as the mortgage payments are made on time. However, if there is a pattern of purchasing properties as primary residences and converting them to rentals in less than a year, that could be grounds for prosecution for mortgage fraud .\n\nHere are a few options mentioned in the document that may be used as workarounds for your situation:\n\n1. **Purchase as a Second Home or Investment**: You might be able to purchase the property as a second home or an investment property, which can typically still obtain financing up to 80%. Purchasing as a second home may have specific lender requirements, so it is advisable to consult your lender.\n\n2. **Stay for One Year Then Convert**: You could purchase the property as a primary residence, stay in it for one year, and then convert it to a rental or sell it.\n\n3. **Purchase with a Rent-Back Option**: If necessary to move before one year, you might be able to buy a second property as a primary residence with a 2-month rent-back once you reach 10 months of occupancy. This is a bit more complex and requires planning, including discussions with your loan officer.\n\n4. **Refinance**: If you need the second property earlier than one year, buy it as an investment and then refinance it as a primary residence once you move in.\n\n5. **Non-Owner Occupied Loans**: You could buy one property with a non-owner occupied loan, which will have different terms and often worse interest rates, but it might create the flexibility you need.\n\n6. **Secondary Residency Mortgage**: A secondary residency mortgage might be feasible, but loan officers usually look at the geographic distance between the primary and secondary residences.\n\nKeep in mind, these suggestions might have different implications in terms of interest rates, down payments, and other loan terms. It is crucial to discuss any plans you have with your loan officer to ensure you understand the financial implications and legal requirements. Moreover, any strategy that involves deception regarding your intentions to occupy the property could put you at legal risk, so any moves you make should be done transparently and within the confines of the law .",

            "Danger. The affidavit is a legal document. Understand the risk of getting caught. If you are planning on using the condo to generate income the chances that you default on the loan are higher than an owner occupied property. That is why they demand more down payment (20%+) and charge a higher rate.  The document isn't about making sure you spend 183+ nights a year in the property, it is making sure that it isn't a business, and you aren't letting a 3rd party live in the property.  If you within the first year tell the mortgage company to send the bill to a new address, or you change how the property is insured, they will suspect that it is now a rental property.  What can they do? Undo the loan; ask for penalty fee; limit your ability to get a mortgage in the future; or a percentage of the profits How likely is it? The exact penalty will be in the packet of documents you receive. It will depend on which government agency is involved in the loan, and the lenders plan to sell it on the secondary market.  It can also depend on the program involved in the sale of the property. HUD and sister agencies lock out investors  during the initial selling period, They don't want somebody to represent themselves as homeowner, but is actually an investor. Note: some local governments are interested not just in non-investors but in properties being occupied. Therefore they may offer tax discounts to residents living in their homes. Then they will be looking at the number of nights that you occupy the house in a year. If they detect that you aren't really a resident living in the house, that has tax penalties. Suggestion: If you don't want to wait a year buy the condo and let the loan officer know what your plan is. You will have to meet the down payment and interest rate requirements for an investment property. Your question implies that you will have enough money to pay the required 20% down payment. Then when you are ready buy the bigger house and move in. If you try and buy the condo with a non-investment loan you will have to wait a year. If you try and pay cash now, and then get a home equity loan later you will have to admit it is a rental. And still have to meet the investor requirements.",
            "Although it may be a little late for you, the real answer is this:  When you close on a mortgage for a primary residence you are affirming (in an affidavit), two intents: Now, these are affirming intentions \u2014 not guarantees; so if a homeowner has a change of circumstance, and cannot meet these affirmed intentions, there is almost always no penalty.  Frankly, the mortgage holder's primary concern is you make payments on time, and they likely won't bother with any inquiry.   That being said, should a homeowner have a pattern of buying primary residences, and in less than 1 year converting that primary to a rental, and purchasing a new primary; there will likely be a grounds for prosecution for mortgage fraud. In your specific situation, you cannot legally sign the owner-occupancy affidavit with the intention of not staying for 1 year.  A solution would be to purchase the condo as a second home, or investment; both of which you can still typically get 80% financing.  A second home is tricky, I would ask your lender what their requirements are for 2nd home classification.   Outside that, you could buy the condo as a primary, stay in it for a year, then convert.  If you absolutely had to purchase the 2nd property before 1 year, you could buy it as a primary with a 2 month rent back once you reach 10 months.  Should you need it earlier, just buy the 2nd house as an investment, then once you move in, refinance it as a primary. This last strategy requires some planning ahead and you should explain your intention to the loan officer ahead of time so they can properly price the non-owner occupied loan.",
            "\"In your particular condition could buy the condo with cash, then get your mortgage on your next house with \"\"less than 20%\"\" down (i.e. with mortgage insurance) but it would still be an owner occupied loan.  If you hate the mortgage insurance, you could save up and refi it when you have 20% available, including the initial down payment you made (i.e. 80% LTV ratio total).  Or perhaps during the time you live in the condo, you can save up to reach the 20% down for the new house (?).  Or perhaps you can just rent somewhere, then get into the house for 20% down, and while there save up and eventually buy a condo \"\"in cash\"\" later.  Or perhaps buy the condo for 50% down non owner occupied mortgage... IANAL, but some things that may come in handy: you don't have to occupy your second residence (owner occupied mortgage) for 60 days after closing on it.  So could purchase it at month 10 I suppose.  In terms of locking down mortgage rates, you could do that up to 3 months before that even, so I've heard.   It's not immediately clear if \"\"rent backs\"\" could extend the 60 day intent to occupy, or if so by how long (1 month might be ok, but 2? dunno) Also you could just buy one (or the other, or both) of your mortgages as a 20% down conventional \"\"non owner occupied\"\" mortgage and generate leeway there (ex: buy the home as non owner occupied, and rent it out until your year is up, though non owner occupied mortgage have worse interest rates so that's not as appealing).  Or buy one as a \"\"secondary residency\"\" mortgage?  Consult your loan officer there, they like to see like \"\"geographic distance\"\" between primary and secondary residences I've heard. If it's HUD (FHA) mortgage, the owner occupancy agreement you will sign is that you \"\"will continue to occupy the property as my primary residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless extenuating circumstances arise which are beyond my control\"\" (ref), i.e. you plan on living in it for a year, so you're kind of stuck in your case.  Maybe you'd want to occupy it as quickly as possible initially to make the year up more quickly :) Apparently you can also request the lender to agree to arbitrarily rescind the owner occupancy aspect of the mortgage, half way through, though I'd imagine you need some sort of excuse to convince them.  Might not hurt to ask.\"",

        "question": "\"When people say 'Interest rates are at all time low!\"\" \u2026 Which interest rate are they actually referring to?\"",
        "answer": "When people say \"Interest rates are at all-time low,\" they are typically referring to key benchmark interest rates set by central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States. These rates influence the cost of borrowing across the economy, including for consumers and businesses. They can affect various types of interest rates, including those for mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and other personal loans.\n\nThe documents provided seem to cover the impact of interest rate changes on the economy, housing market, and investment options, although they do not explicitly state which specific interest rate is at an all-time low. Generally, when discussing all-time low interest rates, the focus is often on the federal funds rate in the U.S., or equivalent benchmark rates in other countries, which central banks manage and adjust to steer economic growth and inflation .\n\nThe federal funds rate, for instance, is the rate at which depository institutions trade balances held at the Federal Reserve with each other overnight, and it serves as the basis for other interest rates throughout the economy. In the late 2010s to early 2020s, many countries saw historically low-interest rates as central banks tried to encourage economic activity by making borrowing cheaper in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTo understand the current state of interest rates in context, it may be helpful to look at recent reports from independent financial analysts or central bank publications, which regularly update and comment on the status of key interest rates.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"You are correct that it could refer to any of the types of interest rates that you've mentioned. In general, though, phrases such as \"\"rising interest rates\"\" and \"\"falling interest rates\"\" refer to the Federal Funds Rate or LIBOR. These are the interest rates at which banks in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, are lending money to each other.\"",
            "As Sean pointed out they usually mean LIBOR or the FFR (or for other countries the equivalent risk free rate of interest). I will just like to add on to what everyone has said here and will like to explain how various interest rates you mentioned work out when the risk free rate moves: For brevity, let's denote the risk free rate by Rf, the savings account interest rate as Rs, a mortgage interest rate as Rmort, and a term deposit rate with the bank as Rterm. Savings account interest rate: When a central bank revises the overnight lending rate (or the prime rate, repo rate etc.), in some countries banks are not obliged to increase the savings account interest rate. Usually a downward revision will force them to lower it (because they net they will be paying out = Rf - Rs). On the other hand, if Rf goes up and if one of the banks increases the Rs then other banks may be forced to do so too under competitive pressure. In some countries the central bank has the authority to revise Rs without revising the overnight lending rate. Term deposits with the bank (or certificates of deposit): Usually movements in these rates are more in sync with Rf than Rs is. The chief difference is that savings account offer more liquidity than term deposits and hence banks can offer lower rates and still get deposits under them --consider the higher interest rate offered by the term deposit as a liquidity risk premium. Generally, interest rates paid by instruments of similar risk profile that offer similar liquidity will move in parallel (otherwise there can be arbitrage). Sometimes these rates can move to anticipate a future change in Rf. Mortgage loan rates or other interests that you pay to the bank: If the risk free rate goes up, banks will increase these rates to keep the net interest they earn over risk free (= \u0394r = Rmort - Rf) the same. If Rf drops and if banks are not obliged to decrease loan rates then they will only do so if one of the banks does it first. P.S:- Wherever I have said they will do so when one of the banks does it first, I am not referring to a recursion but merely to the competitive market theory. Under such a theory, the first one to cut down the profit margin usually has a strong business incentive to do so (e.g., gain market share, or eliminate competition by lowering profit margins etc.). Others are forced to follow the trend.",
            "\"I would say people are generally talking about the prime lending rate. I have heard the prime lending rate defined as \"\"The rate that banks charge each other when they borrow money overnight.\"\" But it often defined as the rate at which banks lend their most creditworthy customers. That definition comes with the caveat that it is not always held to strictly. Either definition has the same idea: it's the lowest rate at which anyone could currently borrow money. The rate for many types of lending is based upon the prime rate. A variable rate loan might have an interest rate of (Prime + x). The prime rate is in turn based upon the Federal Funds Rate, which is the rate that the Fed sets manually. When the news breaks that \"\"the Fed is raising interest rates by a quarter of a point\"\"  (or similar) it is the Federal Funds Rate that they control. Lending institutions then \"\"fall in line\"\" and adjust the rates at which they lend money. So to summarize: When people refer to \"\"high\"\" or \"\"low\"\" or \"\"rising\"\" interest rates they are conceptually referring to the prime lending rate. When people talk about the Fed raising/lowering interest rates (In the U.S.) they are referring specifically to the Federal Funds Rate (which ultimately sets other lending rates).\""

        "answer": "According to a document I found, a group of investors on their own cannot force a company onto a stock exchange. The securities laws dictate what financial information must be reported and when it must be reported, but they do not mandate that a company must go public, meaning list on a stock exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ, merely because it has a certain number of shareholders.\n\nHowever, there is a rule in the United States that once a private company reaches 500 shareholders, it is forced to do extra financial accounting, and it can no longer control who owns a share of the company. At that point, while it is not required by law to go public, it often becomes in the company's best interest to do so due to the financial disclosures that are required when exceeding the 500-shareholder threshold. This rule does not automatically make the company public on a stock exchange, but mandatory disclosures might make going public a more appealing option for the company.\n\nIn the case of Facebook, having more than 500 shareholders would have forced it to file more paperwork with the SEC, but would not have necessarily forced it onto a stock exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ. The Securities and Exchange Commission gives businesses time to prepare for these changes, and companies have until 120 days after the end of the fiscal year in which they cross the 500-shareholder line to begin making their disclosures. Thus, wealthy people alone would not be able to force Facebook to become a public company simply by their influence or financial power; regulatory thresholds and the company's response to these thresholds would play a significant role .",

At a high level, with 500 shareholders the company is forced to do some extra financial accounting and they no longer can control who owns a share of the company, allowing me to purchase shares of google at that point.  At that point, it typically becomes in the companies best interest to go public. See this article about Google approaching the 500 shareholder limit in 2003. Further, Sorkin is not quite correct that \"\"securities laws mandate that the company go public\"\" if by \"\"go public\"\" we mean list on a stock exchange, available for general purchase.   Securities laws mandate what has to be reported in financial reporting and when you have to report it. Securities laws also can dictate restrictions on ownership of stock and if a company can impose their own restrictions. A group of investors cannot force a company onto a stock exchange.   If shares of Facebook are already for sale to anyone, then having >500 shareholders will force Facebook to file more paperwork with the SEC, it won't force Facebook onto the NYSE or NASDAQ.

When companies have more than 500   shareholders, they're required to make   significant financial disclosures --   though they can choose to remain   private and keep their stock from   trading publicly. However, most   companies facing mandatory disclosures   opt to go public. The Securities and Exchange Commission   gives businesses lots of time to   prepare for that milestone.

            "To transfer US$30,000 from the USA to Europe, ask your European banker for the SWIFT transfer instructions.  Typically in the USA the sending bank needs a SWIFT code and an account number, the name and address of the recipient, and the amount to transfer.  A change of currency can be made as part of the transfer.   The typical fee to do this is under US$100 and the time, under 2 days.  But you should ask (or have the sender ask) the bank in the USA about the fees.  In addition to the fee the bank may try to make a profit on the change of currency.  This might be 1-2%.    If you were going to do this many times, one way to go about it is to open an account at Interactive Brokers, which does business in various countries.  They have a foreign exchange facility whereby you can deposit various currencies into your account, and they stay in that currency.  You can then trade the currencies at market rates when you wish.  They are also a stock broker and you can also trade on the various exchanges in different countries.  I would say, though, they they mostly want customers already experienced with trading. I do not know if they will allow someone other than you to pay money into your account. Trading companies based in the USA do not like to be in the position of collecting on cheques owed to you, that is more the business of banks.  Large banks in the USA with physical locations charge monthly fees of $10/mo or more that might be waived if you leave money on deposit. Online banks have significantly lower fees.  All US banks are required to follow US anti-terrorist and anti-crime regulations and will tend to expect a USA address and identity documents to open an account with normal customers.   A good international bank in Europe can also do many of these same sorts of things for you. I've had an account with Fortis. They were ok, there were no monthly fees but there were fees for transactions.  In some countries I understand the post even runs a bank.  Paypal can be a possibility, but fees can be high ~3% for transfers, and even higher commissions for currency change.  On the other hand, it is probably one of the easiest and fastest ways to move amounts of $1000 or less, provided both people have paypal accounts.",
            "The right answer to this question really depends on the size of the transfer.  For larger transfers ($10k and up) the exchange rate is the dominant factor, and you will get the best rates from Interactive Brokers (IB) as noted by Paul above, or OANDA (listed by user6714). Under $10k, CurrencyFair is probably your best bet; while the rates are not quite as good as IB or OANDA, they are much better than the banks, and the transaction fees are less.  If you don't need to exchange the currency immediately, you can put in your own bids and potentially get better rates from other CurrencyFair users. Below $1000, XE Trade (also listed by user6714) has exchange rates that are almost as good, but also offers EFT transfers in and out, which will save you wire transfer fees from your bank to send or receive money to/from your currency broker.  The bank wire transfer fees in the US can be $10-$30 (outgoing wires on the higher end) so for smaller transfers this is a significant consideration you need to look into; if you are receiving money in US, ING Direct and many brokerage accounts don't charge for incoming wires - but unless you have a commercial bank account with high balances, expect to spend $10-$20 minimum for outgoing.  European wire transfer fees are minimal or zero in most cases, making CurrencyFair more appealing if the money stays in Europe. Below $100, it's rarely worth the effort to use any of the above services; use PayPal or MoneyBookers, whatever is easiest.

They market to people who want to show their favorite team colors on their credit card, and are willing to pay extra. Some of these branded cards do come with extra perks: Free shipping, discounts on tickets, being able to buy tickets earlier.  There are 4 other types of cards that have limited usage: What makes it confusing is that large business can actually turn a portion of the corporation into a bank. Walmart has been doing this, and so have casinos.",
            "Not necessarily. You can issue credit cards without a bank involved, although companies which do so may have additional legal complications, such as usury regulations. As an example, AmEx is a network which also issues cards themselves. The company is not a bank; they sold their banking subsidiary in 2007. It's also possible to get a bank-issued credit card without banking with that same company."

        "question": "US citizen transferring money to Indian fiance to buy property",
        "answer": "When transferring money from a U.S. citizen to an Indian fiance to buy property in India, there are several important tax considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. Avoid carrying cash to India in excess of $10,000 without declaring it to Indian customs.\n2. There's no tax imposed on the declared money, but you must declare amounts exceeding $10,000.\n3. It is generally better to perform a wire transfer.\n4. Any transfer from the U.S. in excess of $14,000 will attract gift tax according to IRS guidelines, and you must report this on your U.S. income tax filing and pay the gift tax accordingly.\n5. Once your fiance receives the money, any amount in excess of INR 50,000 is treated as individual income, and they will need to show it under \"Income from other sources\" when filing taxes in India.\n6. For blood relatives, the limit of INR 50,000 does not apply.\n7. Regarding loans, if you opt for this route, ensure compliance with IRS rules. The interest payment on the loan must be reported as income on the U.S. tax return. The tax regulations for no-interest loans are complex, and even with no interest paid, the IRS may impute a taxable interest income to the lender.\n\nIt is important to consult with a tax attorney in the U.S. as well as a Chartered Accountant in India to navigate these complex tax issues and ensure compliance with both U.S. and Indian tax laws .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "A. Kindly avoid taking dollars in form of cash to india unless and until it is an emergency. Once the dollar value is in excess of $10,000, you need to declare the same with Indian customs at the destination. Even though it is not a cumbersome procedure, why unnecessarily undergo all sort of documentation and most importantly at all security checks, you will be asked questions on dollars and you need to keep answering.   Finally safety issue is always there during the journey.  B.There is no Tax on the amount you declare. You can bring in any amount. All you need is to declare the same.  C. It is always better to do a wire transfer.  D. Any transfer in excess of $14,000 from US, will atract gift tax as per IRS guidelines. You need to declare the same while filing your Income Tax in US and pay the gift tax accordingly.  E. Once your fiance receives the money , any amount in excess of Rs 50,000 would be treated as individual income and he has to show the same under Income from other sources while filing the taxes. Taxes will be as per the slab he falls under.  F.Only for blood relatives , this limit of 50,000 does not apply.  G. Reg the Loan option, suggest do not opt for the same. Incase you want to go ahead, then pl ensure that you fully comply with IRS rules on Loans made to a foreign person from a US citizen or resident. The person lending the money must report the interest payment as income on his or her yearly tax return provided the loan has interest element. No deduction is allowed if the proceeds are used for personal or non-business purposes.In the case of no-interest loans, most people believe there is no taxable income because no interest is paid.  The IRS views this seriously and the tax rules are astonishingly complex  when it comes to no-interest loans.  Even though no interest is paid to the lender, the IRS will treat the transaction as if the borrower paid interest at the applicable federal rate to the lender and the lender subsequently gifted the interest back to the borrower.The lender is taxed on the imaginary interest income and, depending on the amount, may also be liable for gift tax on the imaginary payment made back to the borrower. Hope the above claryfies your query. Since this involves taxation suggest you take an opinion from a Tax attorney and also ask your fiance to consult a Charted Accountant on the same. Regards"

        "answer": "For Vanguard, the fee structure for Roth IRA accounts involves incredibly low fees on many funds, with some as low as 0.2%.\n\nThe information for Scottrade does not specifically detail the fee structure for their Roth IRA accounts. However, it suggests using a screener to select no load and no transaction fee (NTF) funds as part of your filters, which implies that options without transaction fees are available.\n\nWhile the exact fee structure for TIAA-CREF Roth IRA accounts is not explicitly stated, it is suggested to contact them and ask about their fee structure. There is mention of no-transaction-fee funds (NTF) but without a provided list, so it would be advisable to inquire directly. The document hints that many firms sell their own funds or other companies' funds without a transaction fee, implying TIAA-CREF may have similar offerings.\n\nI would recommend contacting Scottrade and TIAA-CREF directly to get the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding their fee structures for Roth IRA accounts.",

            "\"This answer is somewhat incomplete as I don't have definitive conclusions about some parts of your question.  Your question includes some very specific subquestions that may best be answered by contacting the investment companies you're considering. I don't see any explicit statement of fees for TIAA-CREF either.  I suggest you contact them and ask. There is mention on the site of no-transaction-fee funds (NTF), but I wasn't able to find a list of such funds.  Again, you might have to ask. Vanguard also offers some non-Vanguard funds without transaction fees.  If you go the Vanguard page on other mutual funds you can use the dropdown on the right to select other fund companies.  Those with \"\"NTF\"\" by the name have no transaction fees. Scottrade also offers NTF funds.  You can use their screener and select \"\"no load\"\" and \"\"no transaction fee\"\" as some of your filters. You are correct that you want to choose an option that will offer a good lineup of funds that you can buy without transaction fees.  However, as the links above show, Vanguard and TIAA-CREF are not the only such options.  My impression is that almost any firm that has their own funds will sell them (or at least some of them) to you without a transaction fee.  Also, as shown above, many places will sell you other companies' funds for free too.  You have plenty of options as far as free trades, so it really depends on what funds you like. If you google for IRA providers you will find more than you can shake a stick at.  If you're interested in low-cost index funds, Vanguard is pretty clearly the leader in that area as their entire business is built around that concept.  TIAA-CREF is another option, as is Fideltiy (which you didn't mention), and innumerable others.  Realistically, though, you probably don't need a gigantic lineup of funds.  If you're juggling money between more than a handful of funds, your investment scheme is probably needlessly complex.  The standard advice is to decide on a broad allocation of money into different asset classes (e.g., US stocks, US bonds, international stocks, international bonds), find a place that offers funds in those areas with low fees and forget about all the other funds.\""

        "answer": "In the context of buying an investment property in Australia, an important consideration for the decision between building a house and buying an existing one is the buying-to-rental-price ratio in the region where the investment will be made. If you are based in a region where this ratio is favorable, it could influence the decision on whether to build or buy. However, the document doesn't provide specific advantages or disadvantages of building versus buying. To provide such details, deeper analysis or additional resources are required. \n\nWould you like me to search further in the document for more detailed information on the pros and cons of building versus buying an investment property?",
        "ground_truth": [
            "When buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved.  At one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and don't want to think of it again (apart from watching the rent come in every week). At the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent. Where is the best place to be - well somewhere in the middle. The most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business. They handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day-to-day nitty gritty of the properties. Regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property, you are going to pay a premium for the brand new. A property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium. I once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new. Also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property. You also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property. Another option you may want to look at is Defence Housing. They are managed by the Department of Defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more, whether they have a tenant in the property or not. They also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over. The pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties (up to 15% or more). Personally, I would not go for a Defence Housing property as I consider the fees too high and would not agree with some of their terms and conditions. However, considering your emphasis on a passive investment, this may be an option for you."

        "question": "Does freedom to provide services allow me contracting in Germany without paying taxes there (but in my home EU country)?",
        "answer": "The freedom to provide services within the EU does allow for cross-border service provision without necessarily having to pay taxes in the country where the services are provided. However, there are conditions to be considered. If you stay in one country for more than half a year (more than 180 days), you are generally considered to be a resident of that country for tax purposes. This principle applies in Germany as well as in many other countries. If you provide services from your home country (e.g., Poland) and visit the German customer only a few times, you would typically not be taxed in Germany. Instead, taxation would occur in your home country.\n\nHowever, issues might arise if you move to Germany to provide the work at your customer's location, as your tax liability could change. Furthermore, if your activity is deemed permanent rather than temporary, the rules might differ, and tax obligations could arise in Germany. The temporary nature of the service is assessed on a case-by-case basis. According to the file, which mentions a specific experience between Germany and Italy, there is no double taxation due to the tax treaty, and this is stated to be part of EU agreements, suggesting that similar agreements exist between Germany and other EU countries .\n\nIt's also important to be aware of \"Scheinselbst\u00e4ndigkeit\" (pretend self-employment) in Germany, which is a situation where a contract claims to be for services with a self-employed provider, but the actual arrangement is more typical of an employer-employee relationship. This could have significant tax and social security implications. The criteria for this are strict, and not complying with them could lead to criminal offenses and liabilities for the associated fees .\n\nPlease note that each case can be unique and dependent on various factors, such as the length of stay, the nature of the services provided, any applicable tax treaties, and specific national legislation. For a definitive answer, you should consult with a tax professional or a legal advisor with expertise in cross-border taxation within the EU.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Also within Germany the tax offices usually determine which tax office is responsible for you by asking where you were more than 180 days of the year (if e.g. you have a second flat where you work). That's a default value, though: in my experience you can ask to be handled by another tax office. E.g. I hand my tax declaration to my \"\"home\"\" tax office (where also my freelancing adress is), even though my day-job is 300 km away.  So if you work mostly from Poland and just visit the German customer a few times, you are fine anyways. Difficulties start if you move to Germany to do the work at your customer's place. I'm going to assume that this is the situation as otherwise I don't think the question would have come up.  Close by the link you provided is a kind of FAQ on this EU regulation About the question of permanent vs. temporary they say: The temporary nature of the service is assessed on a case-by-case basis.  Here's my German-Italian experience with this. Background: I had a work contract plus contracts for services and I moved for a while to Italy. Taxes and social insurance on the Italian contracts had to be paid to Italy. Including tax on the contract for services. Due to the German-Italian tax treaty, there is no double taxation. Same for Poland: this is part of EU contracts. By the way: The temporary time frame for Italy seemed to be 3 months, then I had to provide an Italian residence etc. and was registered in the Italian health care etc. system. Due to the German-Italian tax treaty, there is no double taxation. Same for Poland: this is part of EU contracts. Besides that, the German tax office nevertheless decided that my \"\"primary center of life\"\" stayed in Germany. So everything but the stuff related to the Italian contracts (which would probably have counted as normal work contracts in Germany, though they is no exact equivalent to those contract types) was handled by the German tax office. I think this is the relevant part for your question (or: argumentation with the German tax office) of temporary vs. permanent residence.  Here are some points they asked: There is one point you absolutely need to know about the German social insurance law: Scheinselbst\u00e4ndigkeit (pretended self-employment). Scheinselbst\u00e4ndigkeit means contracts that claim to be service contracts with a self-employed provider who is doing the work in a way that is typical for employees. This law closes a loophole so employer + employee cannot avoid paying income tax and social insurance fees (pension  contributions and unemployment insurance on both sides - health insurance would have to be paid in full by the self-employed instead of partially by the employer. Employer also avoids accident insurance, and several regulations from labour law are avoided as well). Legally, this is a form of black labour which means that the employer commits a criminal offense and is liable basically for all those fees.  There is a list of criteria that count towards Scheinselbst\u00e4ndigkeit. Particularly relevant for you could be\"",
            "You're free to provide services, but if you stay in one country for more than half a year - you're generally considered to be its resident for tax purposes.

        "question": "Why I can't view my debit card pre-authorized amounts?",
        "answer": "The reason you might not be able to view your debit card pre-authorized amounts could be due to a design or business decision by your banking institution. Traditionally, online banking statements are designed to closely resemble old-fashioned printed statements, which did not show holds either. Although some banks and card services do display these transactions online, it appears to be an exception rather than the rule, and it is more common with business or commercial accounts.\n\nBanks may have concerns about customer confusion and potential disputes arising from the display of holds, as customers may not understand that a hold\u2014especially for services like car rentals\u2014can be higher than the actual transaction amount and that it is only temporary. There are two types of holds: \"soft holds,\" where the bank checks if there is a minimum required amount in the account but may not reserve any money, and \"hard holds,\" where the money is actually locked and shown as not available. However, the money is technically still in the account during a hard hold, simply reserved for a specific purpose with a time limit for the merchant to claim it.\n\nFurthermore, the distinction between \"Account Balance\" and \"Available Balance\" varies from bank to bank, with some institutions showing both, while others leave it to the customer to determine what is available. You can always contact your bank to get information about holds on your account that are not pending or completed transactions. The banks may use holds as a way to generate fees, especially from customers with low balances, but usually, these fees can be waived if you persistently contact the bank and make your case .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"The simplest answer to why you can't see it in your online statement is a design/business decision that was made, most probably originally to make online statements differ as little as possible from old fashioned monthly printed statements; the old printed statements never showed holds either. Some banks and card services actually do show these transactions online, but in my experience these are the rare exceptions - though with business/commercial accounts I saw this more, but it was still rare. This is also partly due to banks fearing lots of annoying phone calls from customers and problems with merchants, as people react to \"\"hey, renting that car didn't cost $500!\"\" and don't realize that the hold is often higher than the transaction amount and will be justified in a few days (or weeks...), etc - so please don't dispute the charges just yet. Behind the scenes, I've had bankers explain it to me thusly (the practice has bitten me before and it bothered me a lot, so I've talked to quite a few bankers about this): There are two kinds of holds: \"\"soft holds\"\" and \"\"hard holds\"\". In a soft hold, a merchant basically asks the bank, \"\"Hey, is there at least $75 in this account?\"\" The bank responds, and then has it's own individually set policy per account type as to how to treat that hold. Sometimes they reserve no money whatsoever - you are free to spend that money right out and rack up NSF fees to your heart's content. Yet some policies are to treat this identically to a hard hold and keep the money locked down until released. The hard hold is treated very much like an actual expenditure transaction, in that the money is locked and shown as no longer available to you. This varies by bank - some banks use an \"\"Account Balance\"\" and an \"\"Available Balance\"\", and some have done away with these dual terms and leave it up to you to determine what your balance is and what's \"\"available\"\" (or you have to call them). The key difference in the hard hold and a real expenditure is, technically, the money is still in your bank account; your bank has merely \"\"reserved\"\" it, earmarking it for a specific purchase (and gently promising the merchant they can have their money later), but the biggest difference is there is a time-limit. If a merchant does not process a completion to the transaction to claim the money, your bank will lift the hold after a period of time (I've seen 7-30 days as typical in the US, again varying by institution) returning your money to your balance that is available for purchasing and withdrawal. In every case, any vaguely decent banking institution allows you to call them, speak to some bank employee, and they can look up your account and inform you about the different sort of holds that are on your account that are not pending/completed purchase transactions. From a strictly cynical (perhaps rightly jaded) point of view, yes this is also used as a method to extort absurdly high fees especially from customers who keep a low balance in their account. I have had more than one bank charge NSF fees based on available balances that were due to holds made by gas pumps, for instance, even though my actual \"\"money in my account\"\" never went below $0 (the holds were for amounts larger than the actual transaction). And yes, the banks usually would waive those fees if you bothered to get someone on the phone or in person and made yourself a nuisance to the right person for long enough, but they made you work for it. But I digress.... The reality is that there are lots of back and forth and middle-men in transactions like this, and most banks try to hide as much of this from you the client as possible, partly because its a huge confusing hassle and its part of why you are paying a bank to handle this nonsense for you to start with.  And, as with all institutions, rules and policies become easily adjusted to maximize revenues, and if you don't keep sizable liquid minimum balances (100% of the time, all year long) they target you for fees.  To avoid this without having fat wads of extra cash in those accounts, is use an entirely disconnected credit card for reservations ONLY - especially when you are traveling and will be making rentals and booking hotels. Just tell them you wish to pay with a different card when you are done, and most merchants can do this without hassle. Since it's a credit card with monthly billing you can often end up with no balance, no waiting around for a month for payments to clear, and no bank fees! It isn't 100%, but now I never - if I can possibly avoid it - use my debit/bank card to \"\"reserve\"\" or \"\"rent\"\" anything, ever.\"",
            "No money is stolen. They don't show you the hold for whatever reason (not so good a bank?), but the money is still yours. You just cannot use it, but it is still on your account. These holds usually go away after a week. In certain cases (like a security deposit) it may take up to 30 days. You can request from the merchant to cancel the hold if it is no longer necessary. They'll have to be proactive on that, and some merchants wouldn't want the hassle. It is however a known issue. When I was working in the banking industry, we would routinely receive these hold cancellation requests from merchants (hotels and car rentals).",
            "The hard hold is the bank holding your money for no reason but to make money of your. Like the hotel took deposit for my over night and they released the time checked out in there system but it never showed on my account . I had to call the bank why the numbers are not adding up to my current balance. It's illegal practice by banks to hold your money until your realize you didn't spent that much and that musing amount is not even showing on your account. When it happen they will release after 30 days or you can call the bank right away soon as you done your business so you can use the money right away not the bank"

        "question": "How to rescue my money from negative interest?",
        "answer": "To rescue your money from negative interest, you may consider investing in assets or financial vehicles that have the potential to yield a positive return or at least safeguard the value of your money. Here are some strategies extracted from the document to consider:\n\n1. Local Currency Initiatives: If you're in the US and within the catchment region of a local currency initiative, you could explore getting a grant or loan to get started. These initiatives are often designed to promote local economic activities and may offer an alternative to traditional banking systems .\n\n2. Pension Systems: In countries like Switzerland, paying into the occupational pension system (\"Einkauf in die 2. S\u00e4ule\") can be a tax-efficient way to earn a positive return on your contributions, as the entire payment into the pension plan is tax-deductible .\n\n3. Investing in Stocks: Using brokerage services with fair rates to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks like those suggested for Swiss investors (e.g., Roche, Novartis, Swisscom, Credit Suisse, Logitech, etc.) could help you benefit from potential capital gains, especially since some countries do not tax investment profits .\n\n4. Increasing Pension Contributions: If you are employed, you may discuss with your employer to increase the amount of your salary that goes into the pension, which could provide a better return than negative interest on bank deposits .\n\n5. Seeking Other Investment Opportunities: Explore other financial vehicles, such as buying government bonds, making real estate investments, or investing in precious metals, although each of these comes with its own set of risks .\n\nIt's important to note that all investment opportunities carry risks, and returns are not guaranteed.

That's exactly the point of negative interest rates. They don't want to help you saving money. So you will have to choose what to give up: liquidity, or profitability.  But for now, you still have alternatives. The way you described it one could think that all banks will soon start to charge all their clients. That's just a distortion of facts.  If you are happy with a (close to) 0 income, you might consider opening multiple bank accounts. Many banks charge the negative interest only from certain thresholds (i.e. CHF 100k). Since you're clearly a Swiss resident, that's easy to do for you.  If you don't want to give up making an income, then you have to sacrifice liquidity. There simply aren't any short term (less than 2-3 years) instruments in Swiss Franc that are both safe and yielding a positive income. Which means that you will have to take much more risk then you had with a savings account. Ask your advisor for an investment proposal, but also consider bank independent advisors.",

Essentially, you can add funds to your pension plan to match non-existent employer contributions from times you spent studying etc. The 2. S\u00e4ule is usually defensively invested in bonds, so it's not a completely secure investment. In addition, it's a pretty fixed investment, since you can only get your money out if you buy a house or leave Switzerland for good. However, your entire payment into the 2. S\u00e4ule is tax deductible, so the tax effect in itself should be a very attractive bit of \"\"interest\"\". Your pension plan can inform you about the maximum possible Einkauf.\"",

Since you pay 0% taxes on investment profits, you really should invest.  By going through a broker instead of your bank, you can cash out at any time without losing outrageous fees for the stock commissions (often 2% for banks, around 0% for brokers).

            "\"First off, the answer to your question is something EVERYONE would like to know. There are fund managers at Fidelity who will a pay $100 million fee to someone who can tell them a \"\"safe\"\" way to earn interest. The first thing to decide, is do you want to save money, or invest money. If you just want to save your money, you can keep it in cash, certificates of deposit or gold. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, gold tends to hold its value over time and will always have value. Even if Russia invades Switzerland and the Swiss Franc becomes worthless, your gold will still be useful and spendable. As Alan Greenspan famously wrote long ago, \"\"Gold is always accepted.\"\" If you want to invest money and make it grow, yet still have the money \"\"fluent\"\" which I assume means liquid, your main option is a major equity, since those can be readily bought and sold. I know in your question you are reluctant to put your money at the \"\"mercy\"\" of one stock, but the criteria you have listed match up with an equity investment, so if you want to meet your goals, you are going to have to come to terms with your fears and buy a stock. Find a good blue chip stock that is in an industry with positive prospects. Stay away from stuff that is sexy or hyped. Focus on just one stock--that way you can research it to death. The better you understand what you are buying, the greater the chance of success. Zurich Financial Services is a very solid company right now in a nice, boring, highly profitable business. Might fit your needs perfectly. They were founded in 1872, one of the safest equities you will find. Nestle is another option. Roche is another. If you want something a little more risky consider Georg Fischer. Anyway, what I can tell you, is that your goals match up with a blue chip equity as the logical type of investment. Note on Diversification Many financial advisors will advise you to \"\"diversify\"\", for example, by investing in many stocks instead of just one, or even by buying funds that are invested in hundreds of stocks, or indexes that are invested in the whole market. I disagree with this philosophy. Would you go into a casino and divide your money, putting a small portion on each game? No, it is a bad idea because most of the games have poor returns. Yet, that is exactly what you do when you diversify. It is a false sense of safety. The proper thing to do is exactly what you would do if forced to bet in casino: find the game with the best return, get as good as you can at that game, and play just that one game. That is the proper and smart thing to do.\"",
            "You could buy Bitcoins. They are even more deflationary than Swiss Francs.  But the exchange rate is currently high, and so is the risk in case of volatility.  So maybe buy an AltCoin instead. See altcoin market capitalization for more information. Basically, all you'd be doing is changing SwissFrancs into Bitcoin/AltCoin.  You don't need a bank to store it. You don't need to stockpile cash at home.  Stays liquid, there's no stock portfolio (albeit a coin portfolio), unlike in stocks there are no noteworthy buy and sell commissions, and the central bank can't just change the bills as in classic-cash-currency.  The only risk is volatility in the coin market, which is not necessarely a small risk.  Should coins have been going down, then for as long as you don't need that money and keep some for everyday&emergency use on a bank account, you can just wait until said coins re-climb - volatility goes both ways after all."

        "question": "How do historically low interest rates affect real estate prices?",
        "answer": "Historically low interest rates have a significant impact on real estate prices. Low interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which generally stimulates the economy and increases the demand for housing. This increased demand, particularly if it is not met with a corresponding increase in the supply of new housing, tends to cause house prices to increase. Conversely, when interest rates rise, borrowing becomes more expensive, which can reduce demand for housing and lead to lower house prices. However, it's important to also consider that while interest rates are a major factor affecting house prices, other elements like the unemployment rate can also have a notable impact. Overall, a drop in interest rates will usually lead to an increase in house prices, and an increase in rates typically causes prices to fall, all else being equal .\n\nMoreover, the method of financing affects real estate investment outcomes. For instance, in countries where interest costs are tax-deductible, higher leverage can result in higher yields compared to assets with lower leverage unless there's a substantial increase in variable financing rates. If rates increase significantly, the finance-carrying-cost-to-net-rental-income ratio becomes higher, leading to lower yields for highly leveraged assets in the short term. Over time, the rental market prices may adjust to reflect these higher costs, and landlords would potentially be able to reinvest their net rental income at higher rates .\n\nThe performance of real estate investments in an environment of low interest rates can also depend on the financing structure, as fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages react differently to interest rate fluctuations. If a landlord secures a loan at a fixed interest rate and prevailing rates increase, the landlord gains an economic advantage due to the lower carrying cost of the liability. If the property is sold with the loan attached, this can lead to a higher sale price than if the property were not leveraged because the buyer would be assuming a loan with a lower carrying cost than the prevailing market rates .",

            "The article John cites says no correlation, but this chart from the article says otherwise;  One sees the rate drop from 14% to 4% and housing rise from an index of 50 to near 190. (reaching over to my TI BA-35 calculator) I see that at 14%, $1000/mo will buy $84,400 worth of mortgage, but at 4%, it will buy $209,500. 2-1/2 times the borrowing power for the same payment. But wait, my friends at West Egg tell me that inflation means I can't compare $1000 in 1980 to the same $1000 in 2010. The $1,000 inflates to $2611 (i.e. an income rising only with inflation, no more) and that can fund a mortgage for $546,900. This is 6.5 times the original borrowing power, yet the housing index 'only' rose 3.8X. See that crazy chart? Housing actually got cheaper from 1980 to the peak. Statistics can say whatever you wish.  Interest rate change drove all the change in housing prices, but not quite as much as it should have.  To answer your question - I expect that when rates rise (and they will) housing prices will take a hit. In today's dollars, a current $1000 borrows (at 4%) nearly $210K, but at 6%, just $167K. If rates took a jump from these record lows, that's the nature of the risk you'd take.",
            "Interest rates do generally affect house prices but other factors do too, especially the unemployment rate. However, everything else being equal, when interest rates drop, it makes the borrowing of money cheaper so tends to stimulate the economy and the housing market, increasing the demand for houses and generally causes house prices to increase (especially if the supply of new housing doesn't increase with the demand). When interest rates go up the opposite happens. Usually interest rates go down in order to stimulate  a slowing economy and interest rates go up to slow down an overheated economy. Regarding your situation you are able to get a 30 year fixed rate at today\u2019s interest rates (in Australia the longest fixed rate you can get is for 10 years and the rate is usually 1 or 2 percent higher than the standard variable rate. Most people here go for the variable rate or a fixed rate of between 1 to 3 years). This means that even if rates do go up in the future you won't be paying a higher rate, which is a positive for you. You are buying the house to live in so as long as you can keep making the repayments you should not be too worried if the price of the house drops sometime in the future, because if your house has dropped and you want to sell to buy another house to live in, then that house would have also dropped relative to yours (give or take). So your main worry is that rates will go up causing both house prices to fall and unemployment to rise, and you yourself losing your job and eventually your house. It is a risk, but what you need to consider is if you can manage that risk. Firstly, I believe rates won't be going up in the US for a number of years, and if and when they do start going up they will most probably start going up slowly. So you have some time on your side. Secondly, what can you do between now and when interest rates do start going up in a few years: Try to put more saving away to increase your safety net from 6 months to 12 months or more, or make extra repayments into your home loan so that you are ahead if things do go wrong. If you are worried that you could lose your job, what can you do to reduce your chances of losing your job or increasing your chances of getting a new job quickly if you do lose it? Improve your current skills, get new skills, become an invaluable employee, or look at possible opportunities to start your own business. Do your own research on the types of houses you are looking at buying, the more houses you look at the better prepared you will be when the right house at the right price comes along, and the less chance that you will be rushed into buying what might be an overpriced house. So to sum it up; do as much research as you can, have an understanding of what your risks are and how you are going to manage those risks."

        "question": "Should market based health insurance premiums be factored into 6 months emergency fund savings?",
        "answer": "Yes, market-based health insurance premiums should be factored into 6 months emergency fund savings. The guideline for the size of an emergency fund is to cover unexpected expenses that you have not budgeted for, allowing you to avoid borrowing money to pay for them. In the case of losing a job, one of the immediate concerns would be to secure health insurance, either by continuing the employer's policy with COBRA or by purchasing through the Obamacare/ACA market. It's essential to consider that once you lose your job, the entire cost of health insurance would be your responsibility since most employers pay a portion of these premiums. Including health insurance premiums in your emergency fund is important, especially if you have a pre-existing condition which makes it critical not to let your health insurance coverage lapse .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Yes, you should budget some amount of your emergency fund for healthcare expenses.  How much you budget is really dependent on your particular anticipated costs.  Be aware that health insurance likely costs significantly more than your employer charges you for access to its plan. Since healthcare reform mandated guaranteed issue individual coverage you will have the ability to buy individual coverage for you and, if applicable, your family.  When buying individual coverage you have essentially two choices, your decision hinges on whether or not you'd qualify for a premium subsidy.  If your AGI is below 400% of the poverty line you'll be able to receive subsidized coverage at a state or federal health insurance exchange.  If the subsidy is not meaningful to you, or you wouldn't qualify, you can buy an \"\"off exchange\"\" plan offered either directly through a carrier or an insurance agent (some insurance agents are also licensed to sell exchange plans though it's somewhat rare).  In order to receive subsidized coverage you must buy through a state or federal exchange, or an agent licensed to sell exchange products specifically. If your employer was large enough to be required to offer its plan via COBRA or you live in a state that extends the COBRA requirement to smaller businesses, you can choose that as well.  Bear in mind this option is likely to be expensive relative to individual plans.  It's becoming a less relevant solution with the advent of guaranteed issue individual coverage.  COBRA is not a special type of insurance, it's a mandate that your employer allow you to remain on its plan but pay the full gross premium plus an up to 2% (10% for calCOBRA) administrative fee. Despide popular vernacular, there is no such thing as Obamacare or ACA coverage.  Obamacare reshaped the insurance market.  The ACA outlines certain minimum coverage requirements, generally referred to as \"\"Minimum Essential Coverage.\"\"  While employers and plans are not \"\"required\"\" to meet all of these coverage requirements there is a penalty associated with non-compliance.  The single exception to this is grandfathered plans which can still sidestep a few of the requirements.  The penalty is harsh enough that it's not worth the cost of offering a non-compliant plan. Whether you buy coverage through a state or federal exchange, through an insurance agent, or via your employer's COBRA program you will have \"\"ACA\"\" coverage (unless on the off chance your employer's plan doesn't check the \"\"Minimum Essential Coverage\"\" box).  So generally all plans available to you will have $0 preventive coverage, pregnancy benefits, cancer treatment benefits etc. Another thing to consider is your entire family doesn't need to be on the same plan.  If your family is healthy with the exception of one child, you can purchase $0 deductible coverage for the one child and higher deductible more catastrophic plan for the remainder of your family. In fact you could choose COBRA for one child and purchase individual coverage for the remainder of the family.  The things to consider when you face a lay-off: I tried to mitigate my use of \"\"all\"\" and \"\"always\"\" because there are some narrow exceptions to these requirements, such as the \"\"Hobby Lobby\"\" decision allowing closely held organizations with highly religious owners the ability to remove certain contraception benefits.  Understand that these exceptions are rare and not available to individual plans.\"",
            "\"The guideline for the size of an emergency fund is just a guideline.  I've usually heard it expressed as \"\"3 to 6 months,\"\" but everyone has a different idea of exactly how big it should be. The purpose of the fund is to give you enough cash to be able to pay for unexpected expenses that have come up that you have not budgeted for without you having to borrow money to pay for them. To figure out how big this fund should be, we look at the worst case scenario.  Suppose that you lost your job tomorrow.  What would you do? Cut your expenses.  You'd probably be much more careful how you spend money. Secure health insurance.  This would be done by either continuing your employer's policy with COBRA, or by purchasing your own insurance, likely through the Obamacare/ACA market.  Keep in mind that most likely your employer is paying for a portion of your insurance now, so this expense will go up quite a bit no matter which option you choose. Look for another job.  You'd probably begin your search for a new job immediately. The size of your emergency fund determines how long you will be able to go without income before you need to start a new job. Regarding cutting your expenses, it is up to you how much you would cut.  There are things that are easy to cut temporarily (or permanently), such as restaurants, entertainment expenses, vacations, etc.  You would probably stop retirement investing until you have income again.  The more you cut, the longer your emergency fund would last.  Things you don't want to cut are necessities, like housing, groceries, utilities, transportation, etc.  I would also include health insurance in this list.  Certainly, if you have a pre-existing condition, you do not want to let your health insurance coverage lapse. Your employability is also a factor.  If you believe that you would have an easy time finding similar employment to what you have now, your emergency fund might not need to be quite as big as someone who believes they would have a harder time finding another job.\"",
            "Yes factor into your fund the cost of health insurance.  You basically have three options when facing a loss of income for 3-6 months: Pre-ACA the COBRA one was the default option many planned for because there was no need to change doctors. Of course many people were shocked how expensive it was compared to just looking at the employees share of the monthly premium. For planning you can do some research into the cost of one of the ACA approved plans in your state. Keeping in mind that the lack of income might qualify you for a subsidy. As to the coverage level, that would depend on your situation and the perceived gap. I have known many people who didn't have to pick COBRA until after the new job started so they knew exactly what they needed to cover and what their bills were during the gap.",
            "Yes, it should be. As, where one has insurance, its an expense one would expect one to continue to incur in a normal budgetary emergency, even drop in the extreme."

        "answer": "It seems that you're concerned about the implications of having more than $250,000 in a bank account in the United States. This could be a concern in relation to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits, which, at the time of my knowledge cutoff in April 2023, ensures depositors up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.\n\nIf your concern is regarding the FDIC insurance limit, and you have more than $250,000 in one account at a single bank, the amount in excess of the $250,000 limit would not be protected under FDIC insurance in case the bank fails.\n\nTo ensure your funds are fully covered, you may consider:\n\n1. Distributing your funds across different banks to ensure that the balance in each is under the FDIC insurance limit.\n2. Opening different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking, or joint accounts) at the same bank, as the FDIC insurance limit applies per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.\n\nHowever, if you have another specific concern regarding having more than $250,000 in your account, please clarify so I can assist you further.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "First, what's the reason? Why do you have that much in cash at all - are you concerned about market volatility, are you planning to buy a house, do you have tens of millions of dollars and this is your slush fund?  Are you a house flipper and this is part of business for you? If you need the money for short term use - ie, you're buying a house in cash next month - then as long as you're in a sound bank (one of the big national ones, for example) it seems reasonable.  You can never predict a crash like 2008, but it seems unlikely that Chase or Citibank will go under in the next few weeks. If you like to have a cash position, then split the money among multiple banks.  Buy a CD at one major bank with some of the amount.  My in-laws have a trust which is partially invested in CDs, and they use multiple banks for this purpose to keep their accounts fully insured.  Each separate bank you're covered up to 250k, so if you have $150k at Chase and $150k at a local bank, you're covered.  (You're also covered in a much larger amount - up to 1MM potentially - if you are married, as you can have a separate account each for $250k and a joint account up to $500k.) Otherwise, why do you have that much in cash?  You should invest it in something that will return more than inflation, at a minimum... Edit post-clarifications: $350k is around my level of 'Maybe, maybe not'.  You're risking $100k on a pretty low risk (assuming this isn't a small local bank, and even those are pretty low still).  In order to remove that risk you have to do something active - ie, take 100k somewhere else, open a new bank account, etc. - which isn't exactly the hardest thing in the world, but it does take effort.  Is it worth the 0.001% chance (entirely made up) you lose the 100k?  That's $10, if you agree with that risk chance.  Up to you. It wouldn't be particularly hard, though, to open an account with an online bank, deposit $100k in there in a 6 month CD, then pay the IRS from your other account and when the 6 month CD expires take the cash back into your active account.  Assuming you're not planning on buying a house in the next six months this should be fine, I'd think (and even then you'd still have $150k for the downpayment up front, which is enough to buy a $750k house w/o PMI). Additionally, as several commenters note: if you can reasonably do so, and your money won't be making significant interest, you might choose to pay your taxes now rather than later.  This removes the risk entirely; the likely small interest you earn over 3 months may be similar to the amount you'd spend (mostly of your time, plus possibly actual expenses) moving it to another bank.  If you're making 2% or 3% this may not be true, but if you're in a 0.25% account like my accounts are, $100k * 0.25% * 0.25 is $62.50, after all.",
            "Yes. Although I imagine the risk is small, you can remove the risk by splitting your money amongst multiple accounts at different banks so that none of the account totals exceed the FDIC Insurance limit. There are several banks or financial institutions that deposit money in multiple banks to double or triple the effective insurance limit (Fidelity has an account like this, for example)",
            "If you were married the 250K protection can be expanded by the use of joint and individual accounts. A separate limit also exists for IRA accounts.  With out those options you will have to put some additional money into another banking institution. This could be a bank or credit union. You have to be careful to make sure that any additional accounts have FDIC or NCUA (for Credit Unions) coverage. Some banking institutions try and turn customers to non-covered accounts that are either investment accounts or use a 3rd party to protect them. You could also use it to invest in US government bonds through Treasury direct. Though for just the few months that you will be in the excess position it probably isn't worth the hassle of treasury direct.",
            "Many brokerage accounts for trading stocks are covered under SIPC insurance, which is up to $500,000  You can also have multiple checking and savings accounts with the $250,000 balance split up. You can also check your bank's capital ratio on the FDIC website, somewhere. The FDIC won't move on them unless it falls under 3% and even then FDIC will force them into receivership and sell them to a bigger bank before they go bust and experience losses of customer deposits. This is what mostly happened when hundreds of banks failed during the crisis from 2008-2010. There were very isolated events where customers actually lost their cash balances, and that was mostly because those customers had completely uninsured accounts. As that was the most extreme moment in US and global financial history, you should be able to judge risk with the aforementioned information in mind. You can stay in a cash balance easily and be fully insured.",

        "question": "What is a reasonable salary for the owner and sole member of a small S-Corp?",
        "answer": "Determining a reasonable salary for the owner and sole member of a small S-Corp involves assessing the work you are performing for the corporation and what a comparable salary would be for those services. The reasoning is that if you had to hire someone to perform your role, what would you have to pay them, including the compensation for non-billable administrative tasks like invoicing and bookkeeping.\n\nAn important court case that touched on this subject is Watson v. Commissioner, where the IRS challenged the amount the S-Corp owner was paying himself in salary versus distributions. The S-Corp owner, Watson, was taking a significantly lower salary compared to the high distributions he received. The IRS re-characterized a larger portion of his distributions as salary based on the comparison with peers in similar firms, arriving at a reasonable salary figure of $93,000.\n\nIt is also important to note that if an S-Corp is bringing in profits that are solely the result of the owner's work, it may be difficult to justify why the profits shouldn't primarily go toward the salary of the owner, especially if the amounts fall below the FICA Social Security limits. This could indicate an attempt to evade FICA taxes.\n\nIt is crucial to consult with a professional, such as an accountant or attorney, to help you determine an appropriate salary for your situation. Professional advice can significantly strengthen your defense if the IRS decides to audit your S-Corp. Relying on internet articles or non-professional advice for determining your salary could be problematic during an IRS audit .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"The answer depends on this: If you had to hire someone to do what you are doing in the S-corp, what would you pay them?  If you are doing semi-unskilled work part-time, then $20k might be reasonable.  If you are a professional working full time, it's too low.  Don't forget that, in addition to \"\"billable\"\" work, you are also doing office tasks, such as invoicing and bookkeeping, that the IRS will also want to see you getting paid for. There was an important court ruling on this subject recently: Watson v. Commissioner.  Watson owned an S-Corp where he was the sole employee.  The S-Corp itself was a 25% owner in a very successful accounting firm that Watson worked through.  All of the revenue that Watson generated at the accounting firm was paid to the S-Corp, which then paid Watson through salary and distributions.  Watson was paying himself $24k a year in salary and taking over $175k a year in distributions.  For comparison, even first-year accountants at the firm were making more than $24k a year in salary.  The IRS determined that this salary amount was too low.  To determine an appropriate amount for Watson's salary, the IRS did a study of the salaries of peers in firms of the same size as the firm Watson was working with, taking into account that owners of firms earn a higher salary than non-owners.  The number that the IRS arrived at was $93k.  Watson was allowed to take the rest ($80k+ each year) as distributions. Again, this number was based on a study of the salaries of peers.  It was far short of the $200k+ that the S-Corp was pulling in from the accounting firm.  Clearly, Watson was paying himself far too low of a salary.  But even at this extreme example, where Watson's S-Corp was directly getting all of its revenue from one accounting firm in which Watson was an owner, the IRS still did not conclude that all of the revenue should have been salary and subject to payroll taxes. You should ask an accountant or attorney for advice.  They can help you determine an appropriate amount for your salary.  Don't be afraid of an audit, but make sure that you can defend your choices if you do get audited. If your choices are based on professional advice, that will help your case.  See these articles for more information:\"",
            "\"Generally if you're a sole S-Corp employee - it is hard to explain how the S-Corp earned more money than your work is worth. So it is reasonable that all the S-Corp profits would be pouring into your salary. Especially when the amounts are below the FICA SS limits when separating salary and distributions are a clear sign of FICA tax evasion. So while it is hard to say if you're going to be subject to audit, my bet is that if you are - the IRS will claim that you underpaid yourself. One of the more recent cases dealing with this issue is Watson v Commissioner. In this case, Watson (through his S-Corp which he solely owned) received distributions from a company in the amounts of ~400K. He drew 24K as salary, and the rest as distributions. The IRS forced re-characterizing distributions into salary up to 93K (the then-SS portion of the FICA limit), and the courts affirmed. Worth noting, that Watson didn't do all the work himself, and that was the reason that some of the income was allowed to be considered distribution. That wouldn't hold in a case where the sole shareholder was the only revenue producer, and that is exactly my point. I feel that it is important to add another paragraph about Nolo, newspaper articles, and charlatans on the Internet. YOU CANNOT RELY ON THEM. You cannot defend your position against IRS by saying \"\"But the article on Nolo said I can not pay SE taxes on my earnings!\"\", you cannot say \"\"Some guy called littleadv lost an argument with some other guy called Ben Miller because Ben Miller was saying what everyone wants to hear\"\", and you can definitely not say \"\"But I don't want to pay taxes!\"\". There's law, there are legal precedents. When some guy on the Internet tells you exactly what you want to hear - beware. Many times when it is too good to be true - it is in fact not true. Many these articles are written by people who are interested in clients/business. By the time you get to them - you're already in deep trouble and will pay them to fix it. They don't care that their own \"\"advice\"\" got you into that trouble, because it is always written in generic enough terms that they can say \"\"Oh, but it doesn't apply to your specific situation\"\". That's the main problem with these free advice - they are worth exactly what you paid for them. When you actually pay your CPA/Attorney - they'll have to take responsibility over their advice. Then suddenly they become cautious. Suddenly they start mentioning precedents and rulings telling you to not do things. Or not, and try and play the audit roulette, but these types are long gone when you get caught.\"",

Understand that compulsive spending may be a psychological issue: Acknowledge that the compulsion to spend is not just a monetary problem but might have psychological roots. Hence, seeking professional help from a counselor or therapist is vital for addressing the underlying issues that might be driving the compulsion .\n\n2. Work together on financial management: It's crucial that both you and your spouse agree that managing finances and reducing overspending is essential. Attempts to impose strict control without mutual agreement can be counterproductive. If an agreement on budgeting cannot be reached, counseling might be necessary .\n\n3. Temporary control of finances: You might persuade your spouse to let you handle all credit cards and manage the money for a set period, like 3 months, to observe changes in spending patterns. This can give your spouse a sense of being part of the solution without feeling permanent discomfort .\n\n4. Set purchase alerts: Set up bank alerts to notify you of certain purchases made by your spouse. Instant notifications can act as a deterrent by creating immediate accountability for each transaction .\n\n5. Create separate financial accounts: It may be helpful to establish separate accounts for savings, credit cards, and retirement, while maintaining a joint account only for essential expenses like mortgage and bills. This can protect you from financial harm due to your spouse's spending habits .\n\nKeep in mind that addressing compulsive spending could be a long and challenging process.

            "\"Based on the conversations in the comments, I believe a pragmatic solution would be the best immediate course of action, while still working on the long term addiction issues. The first step is to get your husband to agree to give you all of his credit cards and let you manage the money for a set period of time, say 3 months, to see how it goes. (In my experience people are more likely to agree to being uncomfortable for a finite period of time, rather than indefinitely.) Step 2 is to provide him a means for making purchases on his own, but with a limited budget. Here are some examples: Perhaps a combination of the above options would work best. Another thing to consider is to set up alerts with your bank so that you are notified of certain purchases (or all) that are made by your husband. This varies by bank, but nowadays most will allow you to receive text/email immediately when the purchase happens, and can be set to certain amounts or categories. There is a definite psychological difference between, \"\"If I buy this, my spouse will find out at the end of the month and berate me.\"\" and \"\"If I buy this, my spouse is going to run in here in 30 seconds and berate me.\"\" The latter might actually be a deterrent on its own, and you may likely have the opportunity to undo the purchase if you wish to. As a side note, it's important to realize that the above suggestions are still allowing for some limited amount of enabling and temptation to occur. If the addiction is such that it is hazardous to one's health (for example drugs or alcohol addiction), then I don't believe this would be the best course of action. These suggestions are based on my impression that the biggest concern at the moment is financial, and I believe these ideas help to mitigate that. Good luck.\"",

        "question": "How and Should I Invest (As a college 18 year old with minimal living expenses)?",
        "answer": "As an 18-year-old college student with minimal living expenses, you are in an advantageous position to start thinking about your financial future. One of the first steps is to establish an emergency fund, which can help you manage unforeseen expenses; an amount like $1,000 is a great start for this purpose. Before considering long-term investments, it's important to ensure you have enough saved to cover any immediate and short-term costs, as these can quickly arise during college .\n\nFor long-term investing, it might be more prudent to wait until you have secured your first full-time job, at which point you might have more financial stability to dedicate funds to investments. Diversified index funds are recommended for retirement savings because they offer a balance between stocks and bonds, reducing risk compared to investing only in individual stocks. When you do have excess money that you can afford to lose, individual stock investments can become an option .\n\nRegarding investment platforms, it's advisable to use established brokerage firms with a solid track record and necessary regulations in place, such as Vanguard, Schwab, ETrade, and Scottrade. These firms offer access to a range of investment products like ETFs and Mutual Funds with no or low minimum account balances and commission fees, making them suitable for long-term investment relationships .\n\nIf you're considering joining a credit union, look for one that offers competitive rates and consider whether they have any account signup incentives. However, make sure to have a good credit score before applying to maximize the chances of being accepted. And, whenever you are ready to invest, you might consider platforms that provide affordable access to the market, but always stay objective and exercise due diligence regarding the platform's sustainability and funding sources .\n\nRemember to prioritize building your credit, managing short-term financial needs, and establishing emergency funds over making significant investments at this stage. These steps will form a solid foundation, which is essential before diving into the world of investing.",

            "I have about $1K in savings, and have been told that you should get into investment and saving for retirement early. I make around $200 per week, which about $150 goes into savings. That's $10k per year.  The general rule of thumb is that you should have six months income as an emergency fund.  So your savings should be around $5k.  Build that first.   Some argue that the standard should be six months of living expenses rather than income.  Personally, I think that this example is exactly why it is income rather than living expenses.  Six months of living expenses in this case would only be $1250, which won't pay for much.  And note that living expenses can only be calculated after the fact.  If your estimate of $50 a week is overly optimistic, you might not notice for months (until some large living expense pops up).   Another problem with using living expenses as the measure is that if you hold down your living expenses to maximize your savings, this helps both measures.  Then you hit your savings target, and your living expenses increase.  So you need more savings.  By contrast, if your income increases but your living expenses do not, you still need more savings but you can also save more money.  Doesn't really change the basic analysis though.  Either way you have an emergency savings target that you should hit before starting your retirement savings.   If you save $150 per week, then you should have around $4k in savings at the beginning of next year.  That's still low for an emergency fund by the income standard.  So you probably shouldn't invest next year.  With a living expenses standard, you could have $6250 in savings by April 15th (deadline for an IRA contribution that appears in the previous tax year).  That's $5000 more than the $1250 emergency fund, so you could afford an IRA (probably a Roth) that year.   If you save $7500 next year and start with $4k in savings (under the income standard for emergency savings), that would leave you with $11,500.  Take $5500 of that and invest in an IRA, probably a Roth.  After that, you could make a $100 deposit per week for the next year.  Or just wait until the end.   If you invested in an IRA the previous year because you decided use the living expenses standard, you would only have $6500 at the end of the year.  If you wait until you have $6750, you could max out your IRA contribution.  At that point, your excess income for each year would be larger than the maximum IRA contribution, so you could max it out until your circumstances change.   If you don't actually save $3k this year and $7500 next year, don't sweat it.  A college education is enough of an investment at your age.  Do that first, then emergency savings, then retirement.   That will flip around once you get a better paying, long term job.  Then you should include retirement savings as an expected cost.  So you'd pay the minimum required for your education loans and other required living expenses, then dedicate an amount for retirement savings, then build your emergency savings, then pay off your education loans (above the minimum payment).  This is where it can pay to use the more aggressive living expenses standard, as that allows you to pay off your education loans faster.   I would invest retirement savings in a nice, diversified index fund (or two since maintaining the correct stock/bond mix of 70%-75% stocks is less risky than investing in just bonds much less just stocks).  Investing in individual stocks is something you should do with excess money that you can afford to lose.  Secure your retirement first.  Then stock investments are gravy if they pan out.  If they don't, you're still all right.  But if they do, you can make bigger decisions, e.g. buying a house.   Realize that buying individual stocks is about more than just buying an app.  You have to both check the fundamentals (which the app can help you do) and find other reasons to buy a stock.  If you rely on an app, then you're essentially joining everyone else using that app.  You'll make the same profit as everyone else, which won't be much because you all share the profit opportunities with the app's system.  If you want to use someone else's system, stick with mutual funds.  The app system is actually more dangerous in the long term.   Early in the app's life cycle, its system can produce positive returns because a small number of people are sharing the benefits of that system.  As more people adopt it though, the total possible returns stay the same.  At some point, users saturate the app.  All the possible returns are realized.  Then users are competing with each other for returns.  The per user returns will shrink as usage grows.   If you have your own system, then you are competing with fewer people for the returns from it.  Share the fundamental analysis, but pick your stocks based on other criteria.  Fundamental analysis will tell you if a stock is overvalued.  The other criteria will tell you which undervalued stock to buy.",
            "You have great intentions, and a great future. As far as investing goes, you're a bit early. Unless your parents or other benefactor is going to pay every dime of your expenses, you'll have costs you need to address. $1000 is the start of a nice emergency fund, but not yet enough to consider investing for the long term. If you continue to work, it's not tough to burn through $200/wk especially when you are in college and have more financial responsibility.",
            "I'd suggest you keep putting money in your savings account and start investing after you land that first big job. As another answer mentioned, unless you're fortunate enough to have all of your tuition and living expenses paid for, an emergency fund is an invaluable tool for a college student.

Your laptop gets stolen or your car's air conditioner (or heater) dies -- both of these things happened to me in college -- and it would have been a much bigger deal for me if I didn't have some money tucked away.",

I'm sure they have the right licensing and proper SIPC coverage etc, but I wouldn't, personally, trust my money to an entity that's almost entirely funded by venture capital.  I would stick to a company that exists and is profitable on it's own.  All of the major brokerage houses (Vanguard, Schwab, ETrade, Scottrade, etc) in the US give account holders access to a list of ETFs and Mutual Funds with zero load on deposits, no or low minimum account balances, no or low investment minimums, and no commissions.  With access to these no cost options, I wouldn't waste time with an entity that exists because of it's investor fund raising abilities.",
            "\"The $1K in funds are by default your emergency fund.

Profitable organizations & proprietors, borrow at a lower cost of capital than their return. Join your local credit union, you're welcome to join mine online, the current rates for the first $500 in both your checking and savings is 4.07%, it's currently the fourth largest in the U.S. by assets. You may join as a \"\"family member\"\" to me (Karl Erdmann), not sure what their definition of \"\"family\"\" is, I'd be happy to trace our ancestry if need be or consider other options. Their current incentive program, like many institutions have often, will give you $100 for going through the hassle to join and establish a checking and savings. Some institutions, such as this credit union, have a lower threshold to risk, applicants may be turned down for an account if there is any negative history or a low credit score, shooting for a score of 600 before applying seems safest.  The web services, as you mentioned, have significantly improved the layman's ability to cost effectively invest funds and provide liquidity. Robinhood currently seems to be providing the most affordable access to the market. It goes without saying, stay objective with your trust of any platform, as you may have noticed, there is a detailed explanation of how Robinhood makes their money on this stack exchange community, they are largely backed by venture funding, hopefully the organization is able to maintain a low enough overhead to keep the organization sustainable in the long run. The services that power this service such as Plaid, seem promising and underrated, but i digress. The platform gives access for users to learn how investing works, it seems safest to plan a diversified portfolio utilizing a mix of securities,such as low Beta stocks or \"\"blue chip\"\" companies with clear dividend policies. One intriguing feature, if you invest in equities is casting votes on decisions in shareholder meetings.  Another popular investment asset class that is less liquid and perhaps something to work toward is real estate. Google the economist \"\"Matthew Rognlie\"\" for his work on income equality on this type of investment. There are many incentives for first time homeowners, saving up for a down payment is the first step. Consider adding to your portfolio a Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs) to gain a market position. Another noteworthy approach to this idea is an investment commercial property cooperative organization, currently the first and only one is called NorthEast Investment Cooperative, one stock of class A is $1K.  If you are interested and plan to focus on equities, consider dropping into your college's Accounting Capstone course to learn more about the the details of fundamental and technical analysis of an organization. The complexities of investing involve cyclical risk, macro and micro economic factors,  understanding financial statements and their notes, cash flow forecasting - discounting, market timing, and a host of other details Wikipedia is much more helpful at detailing. It's safe to assume initial investment decisions by unsophisticated investors are mostly whimsical, and likely will only add up to learning opportunities, however risk is inherit in all things, including sitting on cash that pays a price of inflation. A promising mindset in long term investments are in organizations that focus on conscious business practices. Another way to think of investing is that you are already somewhat of a \"\"sophisticated investor\"\" and could beat the market by what you know given your background, catching wind of certain information first, or acting on a new trends or technology quickly. Move carefully with any perhaps biased \"\"bullish\"\" or \"\"bearish\"\" mindset. Thinking independently is helpful, constantly becoming familiar with different ideas from professions in a diverse set of backgrounds, and simulating decisions in portfolio's. Here is an extremely limited set of authors and outlets that may have ideas worth digging more into, MIT Tech Reviews (Informative), Bloomberg TV (it's free, informative), John Mackey (businessman), Paul Mason (provocative journalist). Google finance is a simple and free go-to application, use the \"\"cost basis\"\" feature for \"\"paper\"\" or real trades, it's easy to import transactions from a .csv.   This seems sufficient to start off with. Enjoy the journey, aim for real value with your resources.\""

Here are some general steps you might consider taking when you inherit a substantial amount of money and real estate:\n\n1. **Pause and Reflect**: Take some time to process the emotional aspect of your inheritance. It can be overwhelming, and it's important not to rush into any significant decisions.\n\n2. **Assess Your Inheritance**: Understand the full scope of what you've inherited. This includes not just the total amount of money but also details of the real estate, such as location, value, condition, and any associated liabilities like mortgages or property taxes.\n\n3. **Create a Financial Plan**: Consider speaking with a financial planner who can help you create a long-term strategy that aligns with your goals and needs.\n\n4. **Consider Your Debts**: It may be wise to use a portion of the inheritance to pay off any outstanding debts, including high-interest credit cards or loans.\n\n5. **Invest Wisely**: Explore your investment options. Diversifying your investments can help manage risk. Think about stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or continuing to invest in real estate.\n\n6. **Plan for Taxes**: Inheritances can have tax implications. Consulting with a tax advisor can help you understand your tax liability and plan accordingly.\n\n7. **Create or Update Your Estate Plan**: This will help ensure that your own assets are protected and distributed according to your wishes in the future.\n\n8. **Give Thought to Real Estate Management**: If you've inherited property, consider whether you want to sell it, rent it out, or live in it. Each option has different implications for your taxes, investments, and personal life.\n\n9. **Build an Emergency Fund**: If you haven't already, use some of your inheritance to create an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.\n\n10. **Charitable Giving**: If you're inclined, you can set aside a portion of your inheritance to donate to charities that are important to you.\n\n11. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about personal finance, real estate investment, and tax planning to make informed decisions or to better understand the advice given by professionals.\n\nEvery situation is unique, so it's important to tailor these steps to your individual circumstances.

            "We don't have a good answer for how to start investing in poland.  We do have good answers for the more general case, which should also work in Poland.  E.g. Best way to start investing, for a young person just starting their career? This answer provides a checklist of things to do.  Let's see how you're doing:   Match on work pension plan. You don't mention this.  May not apply in Poland, but ask around in case it does.  Given your income, you should be doing this if it's available.   Emergency savings. You have plenty.  Either six months of spending or six months of income.  Make sure that you maintain this.  Don't let us talk you into putting all your money in better long term investments.   High interest debt. You don't have any.  Keep up the good work.   Avoid PMI on mortgage. As I understand it, you don't have a mortgage.  If you did, you should probably pay it off.  Not sure if PMI is an issue in Poland.   Roth IRA. Not sure if this is an issue in Poland.  A personal retirement account in the US.   Additional 401k. A reminder to max out whatever your work pension plan allows.  The name here is specific to the United States.  You should be doing this in whatever form is available.   After that, I disagree with the options.  I also disagree with the order a bit, but the basic idea is sound:  one time opportunities; emergency savings; eliminate debt; maximize retirement savings.  Check with a tax accountant so as not to make easily avoidable tax mistakes.   You can use some of the additional money for things like real estate or a business.  Try to keep under 20% for each.  But if you don't want to worry about that kind of stuff, it's not that important.  There's a certain amount of effort to maintain either of those options.  If you don't want to put in the effort to do that, it makes sense not to do this.   If you have additional money split the bulk of it between stock and bond index funds.  You want to maintain a mix between about 70/30 and 75/25 stocks to bonds.  The index funds should be based on broad indexes.  They probably should be European wide for the most part, although for stocks you might put 10% or so in a Polish fund and another 15% in a true international fund.   Think over your retirement plans.  Where do you want to live?  In your current apartment?  In a different apartment in the same city?  In one of the places where you inherited property?  Somewhere else entirely?  Also, do you like to vacation in that same place?   Consider buying a place in the appropriate location now (or keeping the one you have if it's one of the inherited properties).  You can always rent it out until then.  Many realtors are willing to handle the details for you.   If the place that you want to retire also works for vacations, consider short term rentals of a place that you buy.  Then you can reserve your vacation times while having rentals pay for maintenance the rest of the year.   As to the stuff that you have now:   Look that over and see if you want any of it.  You also might check if there are any other family members that might be interested.  E.g. cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.  If not, you can probably sell it to a professional company that handles estate sales.  Make sure that they clear out any junk along with the valuable stuff.   Consider keeping furniture for now.  Sometimes it can help sell a property.   You might check if you want to drive either of them.  If not, the same applies, check family first.  Otherwise, someone will buy them, perhaps on consignment (they sell for a commission rather than buying and reselling).   There's no hurry to sell these.  Think over whether you might want them.   Consider if they hold any sentimental value to you or someone else.  If not, sell them.  If there's any difficulty finding a buyer, consider renting them out.  You can also rent them out if you want time to make a decision.  Don't leave them empty too long.  There's maintenance that may need done, e.g. heat to keep water from freezing in the pipes.   That's easy, just invest that.   I wouldn't get in too much of a hurry to donate to charity.  You can always do that later.  And try to donate anonymously if you can.  Donating often leads to spam, where they try to get you to donate more."

        "answer": "Doing research on stocks, often referred to as \"doing your homework,\" is indeed considered an important part of the investment process for many investors. According to the document provided, there are several insights that support the importance of being informed and having a strategy when it comes to stock investing.\n\nFor example, the document cites a personal strategy from the author who looks for \"unicorn companies,\" which are characterized by a long uninterrupted history of paying dividends, regularly increased dividends that do not exceed the net profit per share of the company, and a long history of increasing share price. These are seen as very valuable but rare investment opportunities .\n\nFurthermore, the document refers to a research paper, \"Do Stocks Outperform Treasury Bills?\" by Hendrik Bessembinder, which examines the entire history of the U.S. stock universe. The finding is intriguing; less than 4% of stocks are responsible for all the wealth creation in the U.S. stock market. This suggests that while a small percentage of stocks contribute significantly to market gains, the ability to pick these winners could play a crucial role in investment success. However, it also implies that without extensive research, a random approach to stock selection could be adopted, albeit with a different strategy such as shorting the stocks .\n\nIn addition to these specific strategies, the document emphasizes the idea that individual investors may benefit from investing in mutual funds or index funds, particularly when starting out or investing small amounts, due to the diversification and the reduced risk these types of investments typically offer compared to individual stocks .\n\nLastly, the document mentions that many people may either lack the knowledge or prefer not to do their own research, leading them to pay for professional advice or simply speculate, which can often result in losses .\n\nAltogether, these points from the document suggest that research and homework on stocks can be very beneficial and are an important component of a thoughtful investment strategy. They can help in identifying high-potential investments and enable investors to make more informed decisions, although there are also strategies that suggest a less research-intensive approach for those who choose it.",

            "\"Doing your homework means to perform what's more accurately called \"\"fundamental analysis\"\". According to proponents of fundamental analysis (FA), it is possible to accurately determine how much a stock should trade for and then buy or sell the stock based on whether it trades above or below this target price. This target price is based on the discounted anticipated future earnings of your stock, so \"\"doing your homework\"\" means that you figure out how much future earnings you can expect from the stock and then figuring out at what rate you want to discount those future earnings (Are 1000 dollars that you'll earn next year worth $800 today or $900 or only $500? That depends on the overall economic and political climate...) So does this make any sense? Depends. I'm aware that there are a lot of anecdotes of people researching a stock, buying that stock and doing well with that stock. But poor decisions can at times lead to good outcomes... EDIT: Due to some criticism, I want to expand on a few points. So, is homework completely for naught? No!\"",
            "\"TL;DR: Sure, \"\"do your own homework\"\" is sometimes a cop out. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do our homework. I agree that in many cases this is a cop-out by commentators. However, even if you believe in perfect market efficiency, there is benefit in \"\"doing your homework\"\" for many reasons. One of which you already mention in the question: different stocks all with the same \"\"value\"\" might have widely ranging risk. Another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences. High dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others. One stock might be priced at $40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product. This might make this stock very risky with a 20% of being $150 in 12 months, and a 80% chance of being $20. Another stock might be priced at $40 because the company is a cash cow, declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $0.40 per quarter. Low risk, but also with some potential tax disadvantages. Another stock might be priced at $40 because it's a high growth stock. This would be less risky than the first example, but more risky than the second example. And the risk would be more generalized, i.e. there wouldn't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock. In short, even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly, not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone. Sometimes when we hear an analyst say \"\"they should have done their homework\"\" they are really saying \"\"This was a high risk/high reward stock. They should have known that this had a potential downside.\"\" And that all assumes that we believe in 100% pure market efficiency. Which many disagree with, at least to some extent. For example, if we instead subscribe to Peter Lynch's theories about \"\"local knowledge\"\", we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts. A professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company. (This is especially true of small and mid cap stocks.) If you happen to be an expert in LED lighting, it is entirely feasible (at least to me) that you could be able to do a better job of \"\"doing homework\"\" on CREE than the analysts. Or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work, and you know that the latest version stinks, then you will likely know more than the analyst does. I think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor. We could say to ourselves \"\"the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine, I'm just going to do what they tell me to do.\"\" And 99% of the time, that is the right thing to do. But if we do our \"\"homework\"\" anyway, and research the symptoms, diagnoses, and drugs ourselves as well, we can do get benefits. Sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions. Sometimes we can ask smarter questions. And sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor doesn't have and can actually make an important discovery they didn't know. (And, just like investing, sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals.)\"",
            "\"The markets are not as information efficient as some might have you believe. But on the contrary, looking up what the aggregate professional analysts have said is also part of \"\"doing your homework\"\"\"",
            "In fact markets are not efficient and participants are not rational. That is why we have booms and busts in markets. Emotions and psychology play a role when investors and/or traders make decisions, sometimes causing them to behave in unpredictable or irrational ways. That is why stocks can be undervalued or overvalued compared to their true value.  Also, different market participants may put a different true value on a stock (depending on their methods of analysis and the information they use to base their analysis on). This is why there are always many opportunities to profit (or lose your money) in liquid markets. Doing your research, homework, or analysis can be related to fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or a combination of the two. For example, you could use fundamental analysis to determine what to buy and then use technical analysis to determine when to buy. To me, doing your homework means to get yourself educated, to have a plan, to do your analysis (both FA and TA), to invest or trade according to your plan and to have a risk management strategy in place. Most people are too lazy to do their homework so will pay someone else to do it for them or they will just speculate (on the latest hot tip) and lose most of their money."

        "answer": "In the event of an economic crash where cash becomes worthless, the decision between buying gold or silver is not straightforward as each has its own characteristics and implications. The document available discusses some of the properties of gold and how it has been traditionally perceived as a store of value. It mentions that gold does not have intrinsic value beyond being rare and having been used as money for thousands of years, but that historically, it has numerous characteristics that make it an ideal currency. However, this does not give it intrinsic value, meaning its worth is dependent on what someone else is willing to exchange for it. Furthermore, the supply of gold has not been able to keep up with the expanding size of global economies which is why countries moved away from the gold standard a long time ago .\n\nIt's argued that gold's actual consumption for industrial purposes is relatively small compared to its usage for investment and jewelry. In a \"collapsed society,\" even the industrial demand for gold found in electronics and other applications might vanish. While there are some industrial applications for gold, many have far cheaper substitutes. Given that substitutes exist for most of gold\u2019s industrial uses and that its value could diminish if popularity or hoarding trends change, the future value of gold in such a scenario is uncertain .\n\nAs for silver, the document doesn't provide specific details on silver, but historically, silver has been used as currency as well and faces similar issues as gold, such as having a value that is largely determined by what others are willing to trade for it.\n\nWhen considering the purchase of gold or silver as a response to an economic crash, it is crucial to think through the implications of what assets you want to hold in a scenario where traditional currency might no longer hold value. It's also worth considering diversification of your assets and possibly investing in tangible goods or resources that might retain value or be useful in the absence of functioning currency markets.

        "answer": "When oil prices go up, certain industries are likely to benefit. Industries and investments that usually perform well with rising oil prices include:\n\n1. Oil company stocks generally experience record profits because the direct demand for oil is relatively inelastic.\n2. Companies that serve as alternatives to oil may also see their profit margins go up due to inflation and increased demand for alternative energy sources.\n3. Materials and energy sector stocks tend to perform well with rising oil prices. This could include companies involved in the production of raw materials and energy resources.\n4. Electric car producers might benefit from higher oil prices as consumers look for fuel-efficient alternatives to conventional vehicles.\n5. ETFs that track materials and energy sectors, such as XLB and XLE in the U.S., might be a practical way for investors to gain exposure to these sectors during times of high oil prices.\n\nIt's important to note that while these general trends may apply to the respective groups, individual company performance within these industries and sectors can vary based on additional factors that need to be taken into consideration when investing .",

That's a high level analysis and the devil is in the details - higher oil prices may favour electric car producers for example or discount clothes retailers vs. branded clothes manufacturers. Another approach it to use a statistical analysis. I have run a quick and dirty correlation of the various S&P sector indices against the oil prices (Crude). Based on the the results below, you would conclude that materials and energy stocks should perform well with rising oil prices. There again, it is a behaviour you would expect at the group level but it may not translate to each individual company within those groups (in particular in the materials sector where some would benefit and some would be detrimentally affected). You could get exposure to those sectors using ETFs, such as XLB and XLE in the US. Or you could run the same analysis for each stock within the S&P 500 (or whatever index you are looking at) and create a portfolio with the stocks that are the most correlated with oil prices. This is calculated over 10 years of monthly returns after removing the market component from the individual sectors. The two important columns are:"

        "question": "How can I determine if my rate of return is \u201cgood\u201d for the market I am in?",
        "answer": "Determining if your rate of return is \"good\" for the market you are in involves comparing your investment performance to relevant benchmarks and considering long-term trends. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the information provided in the file:\n\n1. **Understand the Long-term Perspective**: Expect around 4% real (inflation-adjusted) return per year, on average, over the long term. Remember that achieving high returns like 25-30% consistently over many years is challenging and usually not sustainable .\n\n2. **Compare to Benchmarks**: A commonly used benchmark is the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), which comprises large stable companies that form the core of the U.S. business environment. Comparing your performance to the S&P 500 can help you gauge how well you're doing. Many mutual funds and hedge funds use the S&P 500 as a benchmark, and some may waive their fee if they do not outperform it .\n\n3. **Consider Historical Returns**: While past performance is not indicative of future results, looking at historical returns can give you a sense of what has been considered a good return. For instance, several years have seen the S&P 500 generate returns above 25%, but those are exceptional .\n\n4. **Assess Investment Style**: The way you compare your performance also depends on how you invest your money. Active management could potentially outperform the S&P 500 but often does not do so over time. Passive investments in low-cost index funds that track major indices are generally recommended for individual investors due to their historical performance and cost-efficiency .\n\n5. **Use Reliable Tools**: Consider using tools from financial information providers, such as a free tool from Morningstar mentioned in the document, to accurately gauge your performance against the right benchmarks .\n\nUltimately, a \"good\" rate of return is dependent on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and the overall market conditions. Continuous education and reviewing your investments in comparison to appropriate benchmarks are key to ensuring your investment strategy remains aligned with your objectives.",

You shouldn't expect more than about 4% real (inflation-adjusted) return per year, on average, over the long term, unless you have reason to believe that you're doing a better job of predicting the market than the intellectual and investment might of Wall Street - which is possible, but hard. (Pro tip: It's actually quite easy to outdo the market at large over the short term just by getting lucky or investing in risky askets in a good year. Earning this sort of return consistently over many years, though, is stupidly hard. Usually you'll wipe out your gains several years into the process, instead.) The stock market fluctuates like crazy, which is why they tell you not to invest any money you're likely to need sooner than about 5 years out and you switch your portfolio from stocks to bonds as you approach and enter retirement. The traditional benchmark for comparison, as others have mentioned, is the rate of return (including dividends) from the Standard and Poors 500 Index.

        "answer": "The factors contributing to changes in the US Treasury I bond fixed interest rate are not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, similar principles may apply as with other types of bonds and interest rates. Generally, the Federal Reserve sets the baseline interest rates in response to current and forecasted national and global economic conditions, which in turn can influence bond yields and interest rates across the market. When the Federal Reserve anticipates economic weakness, it may lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, and conversely, it may raise rates when the economy appears overheated to prevent inflation from rising too quickly .\n\nFor the specific mechanisms that cause I bond fixed interest rates to increase, it would be best to refer to the guidance provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the relevant regulatory announcements, as they have the authority to set the rates for I bonds. The information provided in the document pertains largely to market dynamics and central bank policies affecting interest rates in a broader sense, and it does not detail the specific process for setting I bond fixed interest rates.",

            "The Fed is trying to keep the money supply growing at a rate just slightly faster than the increase in the total production in the economy. If this year we produced, say, 3% more goods and services than last year, than they try to make the money supply grow by maybe 4% or 5%. That way there should be a small rate of inflation. They are trying to prevent high inflation rates on one hand or deflation on the other. When the interest rate on T-bills is low, banks will borrow more money. As the Fed creates this money out of thin air when banks buy a T-bill, this adds money to the economy. When the interest rate on T-bills is high, banks will borrow little or nothing. As they'll be repaying older T-bills, this will result in less growth in the money supply or even contraction. So the Feds change the rate when they see that economic growth is accelerating or decelerating, or that the inflation rate is getting too high or too low."

        "question": "As an investor what are side effects of Quantitative Easing in US and in EU?",
        "answer": "Quantitative Easing (QE) has a number of side effects in both the US and the EU. One of the intended effects of QE is to increase the money supply by several percentage points of GDP, which is much higher than what would be required under normal circumstances. This influx of money could typically lead to inflation, which is caused by an abundance of currency (\"too many dollars\") chasing a limited supply of goods and services, resulting in higher prices as consumers bid up the cost of these goods.\n\nHowever, several factors can influence the impact of QE, preventing the straightforward outcome of rampant inflation. For instance, even with the increased money supply, much of the new money can end up being hoarded by consumers and institutions, used for repaying debt, replenishing savings, or invested in safe havens such as gold and Treasury debt. As a result, most of the money injected into the economy by the Federal Reserve is not actively chasing goods and services, mitigating the inflationary pressures that would otherwise be expected.\n\nMoreover, with the demand for U.S. Treasury debt being high around the world, the yields on Treasury bonds and notes are at historic lows, indicating the global market's view of U.S. government debt as a secure investment despite the significant increase in money supply brought on by QE.\n\nIn the EU, similar mechanisms would be at play, with the European Central Bank's QE policies potentially impacting inflation rates, investment behaviors, and the yields on government bonds. Each region may experience these effects differently due to the structural and economic variances between the U.S. and EU markets.\n\nFor an investor, these side effects could influence asset prices, interest rates, currency values, and investment strategies. It's crucial to monitor these factors and adjust investment decisions accordingly to manage risks and take advantage of the changing economic landscape.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Quantitative Easing Explained: http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/10/07/130408926/quantitative-easing-explained The short of it is that you're right; the Fed (or another country's Central Bank) is basically creating a large amount of new money, which it then injects into the economy by buying government and institutional debt. This is, in fact, one of the main jobs of the central bank for a currency; to manage the money supply, which in most fiat systems involves slowly increasing the amount of money to keep the economy growing (if there isn't enough money moving around in the economy it's reflected in a slowdown in GDP growth), while controlling inflation (the devaluation of a unit of currency with respect to most or all things that unit will buy including other currencies). Inflation's primary cause is defined quite simply as \"\"too many dollars chasing too few goods\"\". When demand is low for cash (because you have a lot of it) while demand for goods is high, the suppliers of those goods will increase their price for the goods (because people are willing to pay that higher price) and will also produce more. With quantitative easing, the central bank is increasing the money supply by several percentage points of GDP, much higher than is normally needed. This normally would cause the two things you mentioned: Inflation - inflation's primary cause is \"\"too many dollars chasing too few goods\"\"; when money is easy to get and various types of goods and services are not, people \"\"bid up\"\" the price on these things to get them (this usually happens when sellers see high demand for a product and increase the price to take advantage and to prevent a shortage). This often happens across the board in a situation like this, but there are certain key drivers that can cause other prices to increase (things like the price of oil, which affects transportation costs and thus the price to have anything shipped anywhere, whether it be the raw materials you need or the finished product you're selling). With the injection of so much money into the economy, rampant inflation would normally be the result. However, there are other variables at play in this particular situation. Chief among them is that no matter how much cash is in the economy, most of it is being sat on, in the form of cash or other \"\"safe havens\"\" like durable commodities (gold) and T-debt. So, most of the money the Fed is injecting into the economy is not chasing goods; it's repaying debt, replenishing savings and generally being hoarded by consumers and institutions as a hedge against the poor economy. In addition, despite how many dollars are in the economy right now, those dollars are in high demand all around the world to buy Treasury debt (one of the biggest safe havens in the global market right now, so much so that buying T-debt is considered \"\"saving\"\"). This is why the yields on Treasury bonds and notes are at historic lows; it's bad everywhere, and U.S. Government debt is one of the surest things in the world market, especially now that Euro-bonds have become suspect. Currency Devaluation - This is basically specialized inflation; when there are more dollars in the market than people want to have in order to use to buy our goods and services, demand for our currency (the medium of trade for our goods and services) drops, and it takes fewer Euros, Yen or Yuan to buy a dollar. This can happen even if demand for our dollars inside our own borders is high, and is generally a function of our trade situation; if we're buying more from other countries than they are from us, then our dollars are flooding the currency exchange markets and thus become cheaper because they're easy to get. Again, there are other variables at play here that keep our currency strong. First off, again, it's bad everywhere; nobody's buying anything from anyone (relatively speaking) and so the relative trade deficits aren't moving much. In addition, devaluation without inflation is self-stablizing; if currency devalues but inflation is low, the cheaper currency makes the things that currency can buy cheaper, which encourages people to buy them. At the same time, the more expensive foreign currency increases the cost in dollars of foreign-made goods. All of this can be beneficial from a money policy standpoint; devaluation makes American goods cheaper to Americans and to foreign consumers alike than foreign goods, and so a policy that puts downward pressure on the dollar but doesn't make inflation a risk can help American manufacturing and other producer businesses. China knows this just as well as we do, and for decades has been artificially fixing the exchange rate of the Renmin B (Yuan) lower than its true value against the dollar, meaning that no matter how cheap American goods get on the world market, Chinese goods are still cheaper, because by definition the Yuan has greater purchasing power for the same cost in dollars. In addition, dollars aren't only used to buy American-made goods and services. The U.S. has positioned its currency over the years to be an international medium of trade for several key commodities (like oil), and the primary currency for global lenders like the IMF and the World Bank. That means that dollars become necessary to buy these things, and are received from and must be repaid to these institutions, and thus the dollar has a built-in demand pretty much regardless of our trade deficits.  On top of all that, a lot of countries base their own currencies on our dollar, by basically buying dollars (using other valuable media like gold or oil) and then holding that cash in their own central banks as the store of value backing their own paper money. This is called a \"\"dollar board\"\". Their money becomes worth a particular fraction of a dollar by definition, and that relationship is very precisely controllable; with 10 billion dollars in the vault, and 20 billion Kabukis issued from Kabukistan's central bank, a Kabuki is worth $.50. Print an additional 20 billion Kabuki and the value of one Kabuki decreases to $.25; buy an additional 10 billion dollars and the Kabuki's value increases again to $.50. Quite a few countries do this, mostly in South America, again creating a built-in demand for U.S. dollars and also tying the U.S. dollar to the value of the exports of that country. If Kabukistan's goods become highly demanded by Europe, and its currency increases relative to the dollar, then the U.S. dollar gets a boost because by definition it is worth an exact, fixed number of Kabukis (and also because a country with a dollar board typically has no problem accepting dollars as payment and then printing Kabukis to maintain the exchange rate)\"",

Financial System Disruption: An example from Ukraine in August 1998 demonstrates severe disruptions, where the financial system ceased to function correctly for a month, about 30% of businesses went bankrupt due to a chain reaction, and there was significant inflation and devaluation of the currency .\n\n3. Government Services: A government default could lead to the shutdown of some government offices and could also mean bondholders would be stiffed initially. The government might react by printing more currency to cover ongoing expenses, which could have ramifications such as high inflation rates .\n\n4. Reputation and Credit: The government's inability to meet its debt obligations could damage its reputation and raise future borrowing costs. Breaking promises to investors and those dependent on government support, such as Social Security recipients, can have adverse social and political effects .\n\n5. International Relations: Since many countries base their currencies on the US dollar, a default by the US could have implications for those countries, potentially leading to instability in their financial systems and affecting the value of their currencies against the dollar .\n\nThese consequences are more than symbolic.

        "question": "Relation between inflation rates and interest rates",
        "answer": "The relationship between inflation rates and interest rates is quite intertwined. Generally, central banks, like the Federal Reserve in the United States, will raise interest rates to try to slow down inflation, and lower them when they feel inflation is too low, and there is a need to stimulate economic growth. When the economy is weak, there is less inflationary pressure, which in turn can drive interest rates down. This is a result of what savers can accept to stay ahead of inflation and the decreased levels of borrowing. Conversely, when the economy is booming, the opposite occurs, leading to higher interest rates and inflationary pressure.\n\nMoreover, bond yields are positively correlated to inflation because savers will not want to invest in bonds if they do not provide an acceptable inflation-adjusted yield. Therefore, during high inflation periods, bond yields tend to increase. High interest rates can rein in inflation as they make borrowing more costly, putting a damper on new economic activity which, in turn, can slow the economy and reduce inflationary pressures.\n\nIn the bond market, when interest rates go up, the yield on newly issued bonds also goes up since new bonds have to offer more attractive rates to compete with other investment opportunities. This affects the market price of existing bonds, which must adjust to offer equivalent yields. For example, if interest rates increase from 5% to 10%, new bonds will offer higher coupons to reflect the higher interest rates, and the market price of existing bonds will adjust downward to offer the same yield to investors.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is another important measure related to inflation, as it provides an indication of the average price changes over time for a basket of goods and services that are typically consumed by households.\n\nOverall, the inverse relationship between interest rates and inflation is the main reason for fluctuating rates, where central banks adjust rates to manage economic growth and control inflation .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Possibly but not necessarily, though that can happen if one looks at the US interest rates in the late 1970s which did end with really high rates in the early 1980s. Generally interest rates are raised when inflation picks up as a way to bring down inflation.",
            "When the inflation rate increases, this tends to push up interest rates because of supply and demand: If the interest rate is less than the inflation rate, then putting your money in the bank means that you are losing value every day that it is there. So there's an incentive to withdraw your money and spend it now. If, say, I'm planning to buy a car, and my savings are declining in real value, then if I buy a car today I can get a better car than if I wait until tomorrow. When interest rates are high compared to inflation, the reverse is true. My savings are increasing in value, so the longer I leave my money in the bank the more it's worth. If I wait until tomorrow to buy a car I can get a better car than I would be able to buy today. Also, people find alternative places to keep their savings. If a savings account will result in me losing value every day my money is there, then maybe I'll put the money in the stock market or buy gold or whatever. So for the banks to continue to get enough money to make loans, they have to increase the interest rates they pay to lure customers back to the bank. There is no reason per se for rising interest rates to consumers to directly cause an increase in the inflation rate. Inflation is caused by the money supply growing faster than the amount of goods and services produced. Interest rates are a cost. If interest rates go up, people will borrow less money and spend it on other things, but that has no direct effect on the total money supply. Except ... you may note I put a bunch of qualifiers in that paragraph. In the United States, the Federal Reserve loans money to banks. It creates this money out of thin air. So when the interest that the Federal Reserve charges to the banks is low, the banks will borrow more from the Feds. As this money is created on the spot, this adds to the money supply, and thus contributes to inflation. So if interest rates to consumers are low, this encourages people to borrow more money from the banks, which encourages the banks to borrow more from the Feds, which increases the money supply, which increases inflation. I don't know much about how it works in other countries, but I think it's similar in most nations.",
            "I haven't read the terms here but the question may not have a good answer.  That won't stop me from trying.   Call the real rate (interest rate - inflation) and you'll have what is called negative real rates. It's rare for the overnight real rate to be negative.  If you check the same sources for historical data you'll find it's usually higher.  This is because borrowing money is usually done to gain an economic benefit, ie. make a profit.  That is no longer a consideration when borrowing money short term and is IMO a serious problem.  This will cause poor investment decisions like you see in housing. Notice I said overnight rate.  That is the only rate set by the BoC and the longer rates are set by the market.  The central bank has some influence because a longer term is just a series of shorter terms but if you looked up the rate on long Canadian real return bonds, you'd see them with a real rate around 1%. What happens when the central bank raise or lowers rates will depend on the circumstances.  The rate in India is so high because they are using it to defend the rupee.  If people earn more interest they have a preference to buy that currency rather than others.  However these people aren't stupid, they realize it's the real rate that matters.  That's why Japan can get away with very low rates and still have demand for the currency - they have, or had, deflation.  When that changed, the preference for their currency changed. So if Canada hast forex driven inflation then the BoC will have to raise rates to defend the dollar for the purpose of lowering inflation from imports.  Whether it works or not is another story.  Note that the Canadian dollar is very dependant on the total dollar value of net oil exports. If Canada has inflation due too an accelerating economy this implies that there are profitable opportunities so businesses and individuals will be more likely to pay a positive real rate of interest.  In that scenario the demand for credit money will drive the real rate of return.",
            "Is it true that due the to the increase in interest rates that inflation is likely to increase as well? It is typically the reverse where inflation causes interest rates to rise. Interest rates fundamentally reflect the desire for people to purchase future goods over present day goods.  If I loan money to someone for 5 years I lose the ability to use that money.  In order to entice me to loan the money the borrower would have to offer me an incentive, that is, they would have to give me additional money at the end of that 5 years.  This additional money is the interest rate and it reflects the desire of people to spend money in the future versus the present day.  If offered the same amount of money today versus 5 years from now almost everyone would chose to take the money now.  Money in the present is more valuable than the same amount of money in the future. Interest rates would still exist even with a currency that could not be printed. I would still prefer to have the currency today than in the future. If the currency is continually devalued (i.e. the issuer is printing more of the currency) than borrowers may charge additional interest to compensate for the loss in purchasing power when they make a loan. Also, it is hard to compare interest rates and inflation.  Inflation is very difficult to calculate. New products and services, as well as ever changing consumer desires, continually change the mixture of goods in the market so it is nearly impossible to compare a basket of goods today to a basket of goods 5, 10, 20, or 30 years ago."

        "question": "How do I invest in emerging markets",
        "answer": "Investing in emerging markets can potentially offer higher returns, but they are also associated with a higher level of risk. If you're looking at funds, consider options like the Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) or the Fidelity Advisor Emerging Markets Income Trust (FAEMX), which have been known to yield returns around 11% or so. It's important to take into account that these investments can fluctuate significantly in value \u2014 they can experience large gains because they can also fall sharply .\n\nMoreover, when thinking about investing in emerging markets, you should be aware of the political and economic risks associated with these regions. This includes potential volatility and accounting issues which can affect the performance of your investments. While most large U.S. companies may already have some exposure to emerging markets, you could consider whether it's necessary to invest in a dedicated fund specializing in these markets based on your investment objectives and risk tolerance .\n\nAlways remember to do your own research before investing and if you decide to proceed with investments in high-risk areas like emerging markets, consider using an investment account with favorable tax treatments, such as a Roth IRA. This way, if the investments perform well, the returns will grow in an account that is not taxed upon withdrawal, provided that the laws remain unchanged .\n\nLastly, pay attention to the risk factors outlined in the prospectus of any ETF you consider for investment, which will detail the specific risks that could affect your investment's performance. It's critical to read and understand these before making any investment decisions .",

        "question": "Why could the serious financial woes of some EU member states lead to the end of the Euro?",
        "answer": "Serious financial woes in some EU member states could lead to the end of the Euro because these countries may consider withdrawing their participation in the shared currency to regain control of their national monetary policies. When countries adopt the Euro, they cede their sovereign control over their national currency to the European Union. This limits the ability of individual countries to address their unique economic situations. For example, they cannot adjust their interest rates independently or implement policies like quantitative easing without EU-wide agreement.\n\nIn times of financial difficulty, the ability to control one's currency can be a key tool for stimulating an economy. If a country dealing with severe financial challenges feels that it could better manage its economy by having its own currency, it might consider exiting the Eurozone. If a significant member state decides to leave, it could create a domino effect where other countries follow suit to regain management of their economies, ultimately leading to the unravelling of the shared currency system as the idea of a shared currency becomes less appealing with fewer participants .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The Euro is a common currency between various countries in Europe.  This means that individual countries give up their traditional sovereign control of their own currency, and cede that control to the EU. Such a system has many advantages, but it also means that individual countries cannot deal with their unique situations as easily.  For instance, if the US were a part of the EU, then the Fed couldn't issue $600B the way they are to bolster the economy. The danger to the Euro is that countries will withdraw their participation in order to micromanage their economies more effectively.  If a major country withdraws its participation, it could start a domino effect where many countries withdraw so that they too can manage their economies more effectively.  As more countries withdraw, a shared currency becomes less and less appealing."

        "question": "How and why does the exchange rate of a currency change almost everyday?",
        "answer": "The exchange rate of a currency can change almost every day due to several factors related to the economics of supply and demand in the foreign exchange (FX) market. In the FX market, potential buying and selling parties set the price of one currency in terms of another through their trading activities. Like the stock market, the FX market has buyers bidding and sellers asking for prices, and these prices are determined based on the currency's supply and demand at any given time. Exchange rates fluctuate continuously because of numerous transactions occurring globally and changes in the number of people involved and the nature of their transactions. Supply and demand for a currency can be affected by a myriad of factors, including:\n\n- Economic indicators and forecasts\n- Political events or policy decisions\n- Interest rate differences between countries\n- Speculation and market sentiment\n- Trade balances between countries\n- Interventions by governments and central banks\n\nChanges in exchange rates can denote economic changes or the anticipation of such changes, and while identifying specific drivers from the rate changes alone can be challenging, the impact on trade, investment, and financial stability is significant. For example, a favorable exchange rate can make a region more attractive to tourists or affect the trade balance by altering the cost of exports and imports .\n\nGovernments and central banks might intervene in the currency markets to control or stabilize the value of their currency to avoid economic consequences. For instance, a government may buy another country's currency to prevent their own currency from appreciating too quickly, which could have dramatic implications for their economy . \n\nOverall, the exchange rate of a currency is a composite reflection of many economic forces, and constant changes in these forces contribute to the daily fluctuation of currency exchange rates .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"It's simply supply and demand.   First, demand: If you're an importer trying to buy from overseas, you'll need foreign currency, maybe Euros.  Or if you want to make a trip to Europe you'll need to buy Euros.  Or if you're a speculator and think the USD will fall  in value, you'll probably buy Euros. Unless there's someone willing to sell you Euros for dollars, you can't get any.  There are millions of people trying to exchange currency all over the world.  If more want to buy USD, than that demand will positively influence the price of the USD (as measured in Euros).  If more people want to buy Euros, well, vice versa. There are so many of these transactions globally, and the number of people and the nature of these transactions change so continuously, that the prices (exchange rates) for these currencies fluctuate continuously and smoothly. Demand is also impacted by what people want to buy and how much they want to buy it.  If people generally want to invest their savings in stocks instead of dollars, i.e., if lots of people are attempting to buy stocks (by exchanging their dollars for stock), then the demand for the dollar is lower and the demand for stocks is higher.  When the stock market crashes, you'll often see a spike in the exchange rate for the dollar, because people are trying to exchange stocks for dollars (this represents a lot of demand for dollars). Then there's \"\"Supply:\"\" It may seem like there are a fixed number of bills out there, or that supply only changes when Bernanke prints money, but there's actually a lot more to it than that.  If you're coming from Europe and want to buy some USD from the bank, well, how much USD does the bank \"\"have\"\" and what does it mean for them to have money?  The bank gets money from depositors, or from lenders.  If one person puts money in a deposit account, and then the bank borrows that money from the account and lends it to a home buyer in the form of a mortgage, the same dollar is being used by two people.  The home buyer might use that money to hire a carpenter, and the carpenter might put the dollar back into a bank account, and the same dollar might get lent out again.  In economics this is called the \"\"multiplier effect.\"\" The full supply of money being used ends up becoming harder to calculate with this kind of debt and re-lending.   Since money is something used and needed for conducting of transactions, the number of transactions being conducted (sometimes on credit) affects the \"\"supply\"\" of money. Demand and supply blur a bit when you consider people who hoard cash.  If I fear the stock market, I might keep all my money in dollars.  This takes cash away from companies who could invest it, takes the cash out of the pool of money being used for transactions, and leaves it waiting under my mattress.  You could think of my hoarding as a type of demand for currency, or you could think of it as a reduction in the supply of currency available to conduct transactions. The full picture can be a bit more complicated, if you look at every way currencies are used globally, with swaps and various exchange contracts and futures, but this gives the basic story of where prices come from, that they are not set by some price fixer but are driven by market forces.   The bank just facilitates transactions.  If the last price (exchange rate) is 1.2 Dollars per Euro, and the bank gets more requests to buy USD for Euros than Euros for USD, it adjusts the rate downwards until the buying pressure is even.  If the USD gets more expensive, at some point fewer people will want to buy it (or want to buy products from the US that cost USD).  The bank maintains a spread (like buy for 1.19 and sell for 1.21) so it can take a profit. You should think of currency like any other commodity, and consider purchases for currency as a form of barter.  The value of currency is merely a convention, but it works.  The currency is needed in transactions, so it maintains value in this global market of bartering goods/services and other currencies.  As supply and demand for this and other commodities/goods/services fluctuate, so does the quantity of any particular currency necessary to conduct any of these transactions. A official \"\"basket of goods\"\" and the price of those goods is used to determine consumer price indexes / inflation etc.  The official price of this particular basket of goods is not a fundamental driver of exchange rates on a day to day basis.\"",
            "\"The basic idea is that money's worth is dependent on what it can be used to buy. The principal driver of monetary exchange (using one type of currency to \"\"buy\"\" another) is that usually, transactions for goods or services in a particular country must be made using that country's official currency. So, if the U.S. has something very valuable (let's say iPhones) that people in other countries want to buy, they have to buy dollars and then use those dollars to buy the consumer electronics from sellers in the U.S. Each country has a \"\"basket\"\" of things they produce that another country will want, and a \"\"shopping list\"\" of things of value they want from that other country. The net difference in value between the basket and shopping list determines the relative demand for one currency over another; the dollar might gain value relative to the Euro (and thus a Euro will buy fewer dollars) because Europeans want iPhones more than Americans want BMWs, or conversely the Euro can gain strength against the dollar because Americans want BMWs more than Europeans want iPhones. The fact that iPhones are actually made in China kind of plays into it, kind of not; Apple pays the Chinese in Yuan to make them, then receives dollars from international buyers and ships the iPhones to them, making both the Yuan and the dollar more valuable than the Euro or other currencies. The total amount of a currency in circulation can also affect relative prices. Right now the American Fed is pumping billions of dollars a day into the U.S. economy. This means there's a lot of dollars floating around, so they're easy to get and thus demand for them decreases. It's more complex than that (for instance, the dollar is also used as the international standard for trade in oil; you want oil, you pay for it in dollars, increasing demand for dollars even when the United States doesn't actually put any oil on the market to sell), but basically think of different currencies as having value in and of themselves, and that value is affected by how much the market wants that currency.\"",
            "\"Money is money because people believe it is money. By \"\"believe it is money\"\", I mean that they expect they will be able to turn it into useful goods or services (food, rent, houses, truckloads full of iron ore, mining equipment, massages at the spa, helicopter rides, iPads, greenhouses, income streams to support your future retirement, etc). Foreign exchange rates change because people's ideas about how much useful goods or services they can get with various currencies change. For example: if the Zimbabwe government suddenly printed 10 times as much money as used to exist, you probably couldn't use that money to buy as much food at the Zimbabwe-Mart, so you wouldn't be willing to give people as many US-dollars (which can buy food at the US-Mart) for a Zimbabwe-dollar as you used to be able to. (It's not exactly that easy, because - for instance - food in the US is more useful to me than food in Zimbabwe. But people still move around all sorts of things, like oil, or agricultural products, or minerals, or electronics components.) The two main things that affect the value of a currency are the size of the economy that it's tied to (how much stuff there is to get), and how much of the currency there is / how fast it's moving around the economy (which tells you how much money there is to get it with). So most exchange rate shifts reflect a change in people's expectations for a regional economy, or the size of a money supply. (Also, Zimbabwe is doing much better now that it's ditched their own currency - they kept printing trillions of dollars' worth - and just trade in US dollars. Their economy still needs some work, but... better.)\""

        "answer": "Directly contributing to reducing the US national debt is generally not considered a practical approach for an individual. The reasons for this are multifaceted:\n\n1. The sheer size of the debt is so large that even if a person were incredibly wealthy, their contribution would be a drop in the ocean compared to the overall debt. To put it in perspective, unless you are as wealthy as \"ten Bill Gates rolled into one man,\" it's unlikely you could make a significant impact on the $14 trillion debt .\n\n2. Addressing the debt issue requires long-term fiscal policy changes. The debt is not just about money owed; it's tied to future commitments, such as entitlements for the retiring Baby Boomer generation, which could potentially be adjusted by political decisions rather than individual contributions .\n\n3. Even if an individual could pay off a significant amount of the debt, without systemic changes and fiscal responsibility, budget deficits could easily build the debt back up in a short period .\n\n4. The national debt is structured differently from personal debt because it's money that the nation owes to itself, and if the Gross National Product (GNP) of the country can grow at a rate equal to or greater than the interest on the national debt, the actual figure of the debt may not negatively impact the economy .\n\nIt is suggested that rather than trying to contribute directly to the debt, individuals might instead choose to donate to charities or support campaigns for politicians who advocate for financial conservatism and policies that could lead to a balanced budget .\n\nThis approach is more likely to have a practical positive impact than attempting to directly reduce the national debt through personal financial contributions.",

            "\"At its heart, I think the best spirit of \"\"donation\"\" is helping others less fortunate than yourself. But as long as the US remains solvent, the chief benefit of paying down the national debt is - like paying off a credit card - lowering the future interest payments the U.S. taxpayer has to make. Since the wealthy pay a disproportionately large portion of taxes (per capita), your hard earned money would be disproportionately benefitting the wealthy. So I'd recommend you do one or both of the following: instead target your donations to a charity whose average beneficiary is less fortunate than yourself take political action with an aim towards balancing the federal budget (since the US national debt is principally financed in the form of 30 year treasuries, the U.S. will be completely out of debt if it can maintain a balanced budget for 30 years recanted, see below)\"",

These are just the debts the US has already incurred. The problem is the future entitlements the US is promising to its soon-to-be-retired generation of Baby Boomers.  Medicare, health insurance, and so on are all future costs that can be calculated fairly accurately when considering the size and earnings of the work-force relative to the size, longevity and health of the newly-retired. Governments can \"\"solve\"\" the problems of entitlements simply be reneging on their promises. The concern that investors have is that either entitlements will be paid by raising taxes (and so cutting profits and investment returns) or countries will simply default on their existing debts as their tax receipts run out. As Europe has shown (from French workers rioting about having to retire at 62, to British students rioting about paying their tuition fees), breaking promises has consequences for elected politicians too. Europe is already going rather painfully through this process of economic restructuring.  The US will eventually come round as well.  Just don't expect it to be painless.

        "answer": "When considering how to \"invest the rest\" after getting term insurance, there are various strategies you can follow. It's crucial to align your investments with your knowledge, tolerance for risk, and both short-term and long-term financial goals. Here are some approaches based on the advice from the document:\n\n1. **Invest in Your Knowledge**:\n   - Before investing, educate yourself about financial markets. You don't need capital to learn, but a commitment to developing your financial literacy is essential. Read books, and track companies and market trends using virtual portfolios.\n   - Seek independent advice from a financial planner who charges by the hour, rather than one working on commissions, to receive unbiased investment recommendations .\n\n2. **Retirement Accounts**:\n   - Consider putting part of your investments into a retirement savings account like a Roth IRA. You can open a Roth IRA and a regular brokerage account to manage contributions above the yearly limit. This allows for potential tax-free growth over time .\n\n3. **Diversified Investment Portfolio**:\n   - Engage in long-term stock investments through low-cost index funds which can give you exposure to different sectors and lessen the impact of market volatility. You can consider a mix between large-cap (e.g., S&P 500) and small-cap (e.g., Russell 2000) indexes, with periodic rebalancing to maintain the desired asset allocation .\n   - As you approach retirement, adjust your investment portfolio to include more stable assets like bonds to protect your earnings .\n\n4. **Risk Tolerance**:\n   - Your age plays a role in determining your risk tolerance. Younger individuals can generally take more investment risks, as they have a longer horizon to recover from market downturns. A common recommendation is to invest a percentage in stocks that corresponds to 110 or 120 minus your age .\n\n5. **Emergency Fund**:\n   - Keep part of your money in an easily accessible emergency fund, such as cash savings, that doesn't expose you to market risk .\n\nRemember that investment strategies vary widely based on individual circumstances, and it's essential to seek personalized advice. Employing dollar-cost averaging, rebalancing strategies, and considering tax implications can also help you manage your investments efficiently over time. Keep in mind that investing always involves risks, including the potential loss of principal, and past performance is not a guarantee of future results.",

The biggest issue with the whole life type products is that what your care about for the term insurance doesn't mean that the company  has a good investment program. You also want to have the ability to decide to change insurance companies or investment companies without impacting the other.",
            "The simplest way is to invest in a few ETFs, depending on your tolerance for risk; assuming you're very short-term risk tolerant you can invest almost all in a stock ETF like VOO or VTI.

If you want to hedge some of your risk, you can also invest in Bond funds, which tend to move up in stock market downturns - but if you're looking for the long term, you don't need to put much there. Otherwise, try to make sure you take advantage of tax breaks when you can - IRAs, 401Ks, etc.; most of those will have ETFs (whether Vanguard or similar) available to invest in.  Look for funds that have low expense ratios and are fairly diversified (ie, don't just invest in one small sector of the economy); as long as the economy continues to grow, the ETFs will grow."

Cross-border Trade Influence: Exchange rates play a significant role in encouraging cross-border trade by making goods and services more or less expensive for trading partners, potentially affecting trade balances. For instance, a more favorable exchange rate can increase tourism in an area if tourists find it cheaper to travel and shop due to currency differences .\n\n3.

This can have significant economic consequences, as such interventions can alter international trade dynamics and economic stability .\n\n4. Market Forces: Like stock markets, the foreign exchange market is driven by bidding and asking for prices, where the rates fluctuate based on supply and demand dynamics.

        "question": "How do currency markets work? What factors are behind why currencies go up or down?",
        "answer": "Currency markets, also known as foreign exchange (FX) markets, operate very much like the stock market. In the FX market, potential buyers bid a certain amount of one country's currency to buy currency from another country. Similarly, sellers ask for a certain amount of their currency in exchange for the currency of another country. There are also swaps, futures, and options in this market, akin to those in the stock market. As with any open market, currencies fluctuate in value based on supply and demand, which can be influenced by a multitude of factors such as economic indicators, interest rates, political stability, and market sentiment.\n\nSeveral factors can cause currencies to go up or down. These include:\n\n1. **Economic Conditions**: The state of a country's economy can influence the value of its currency. A strong economy may lead to a higher demand for that country's currency, which can increase its value.\n\n2. **Government and Central Bank Policies**: Governments and central banks may intervene in currency markets to control the value of their currencies. For example, they might purchase foreign currency to prevent their own currency from becoming too strong and adversely affecting their export market.\n\n3. **Speculation**: Investors speculate on the future value of currencies, and these speculative movements can heavily influence currency values. Often, these speculative trends are set based on expectations rather than current economic conditions.\n\n4. **Geopolitical Events**: Political events and stability play a role in currency valuation. For instance, if a country's political environment is unstable, it may lead to a decrease in the value of its currency.\n\n5. **Trade Balances**: Exchange rates between trading partners can affect trade balances. For example, a strong currency may lead to expensive exports and cheaper imports, which can affect a country's trade deficit or surplus.\n\n6. **Interest Rates**: Changes in interest rates affect investment flows. A higher interest rate may attract more foreign capital, leading to an appreciation of the currency.\n\n7. **Market Sentiment**: The overall mood or sentiment of market participants can influence currency values. This can be swayed by news, reports, and other forms of media.\n\nAccording to George Soros, a well-known hedge fund manager, speculation on the future value of currencies is one of the most influential factors, capable of setting trends that can last for years. It is also noted that markets, including foreign exchange markets, are often \"wrong\" in the sense that the current prices do not accurately reflect underlying fundamentals .\n\nCentral banks, governments, institutions, and individual traders all take part in this process, and their actions collectively determine the exchange rates at any given moment. Government intervention, for example, can be a significant force in the currency markets, as seen in the case of the Canadian government purchasing US dollars to influence the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar .\n\nKeep in mind that currencies are traded as commodities in the market, and just like any commodity, their prices can go up or down based on the factors mentioned above .",

            "\"Q: How do currency markets work? A: The FX (foreign exchange) market works very much like the stock market where potential buying parties bid $Y of country 1's currency to buy $1 in country 2's currency.  Potential selling parties sell (ask) $1 of country 2's currency for $Y of country 1's currency.  Like the stock market, there are also a swaps, futures and options in this market. Q: What factors are behind why currencies go up or down? A: Just like any open market, currencies go up and down based on supply and demand.  Many factors affect the supply and demand of a particular currency.  Some were listed well by the other posts. Q: What roles do governments, central banks, institutions, and traders have in the process? A: It's common practice that gov'ts intervene to \"\"control\"\" the value of currencies.  For example, although it's not general public knowledge, the Canadian gov't is actively purchasing up US dollars in the FX market in an effort to stop the US/Canadian exchange rate from dropping further.

I mention his point of view as he is one of the most successful hedge fund manager ever, proved his skills, and dealt a lot with currencies. This is not just theory as he actively used the above points when managing his fund (as explained in the book). What I find interesting is that, according to him, the fundamental reason (the balance of trade) is not the most influential. Speculation on future value of currencies is the most influential, and these can set trends that can last years. Also it is key to notice that Soros thought foreign exchange markets are \"\"wrong\"\" most of the time, just like he thought stock markets are \"\"wrong\"\" most of the time (a point on which Warren Buffet and Jim Rogers also agree from my understanding).\""

        "question": "Is it true that 90% of investors lose their money?",
        "answer": "The notion that 90% of investors lose their money is not universally true. It appears to be a figure that pertains to certain segments of the investing world, particularly among traders rather than investors. In these specific arenas, such as day trading or complex trading systems, the statistic that a substantial majority of participants lose money might be accurate.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to differentiate between \"investors\" and \"traders.\" Over the long term, investors who diversify their investments across various companies or indexes are likely to see profits, especially if they stay invested for a duration of 10 years or more. The key to successful investing is often to have a long-term perspective and a strategy that prevents emotional or impulsive decisions, which can lead to losses.\n\nHowever, markets like derivatives (e.g., options or futures) are zero-sum, meaning that for every winner, there is a loser, making them generally less forgiving. Psychological factors also play a significant role, as many people are not inherently equipped to make the fast and rigorous decisions required by such trading activities.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some statements about the high failure rate of investors may come from sources with a bias, such as those selling alternative trading systems. Since the details vary based on the type of investing or trading considered, making broad generalizations about failure rates can be misleading.\n\nIn light of this, while there can be high rates of loss in certain trading activities, suggesting that 90% of all investors lose money is an exaggeration and not reflective of the diverse outcomes experienced by investors in different markets and with different strategies .",

There are times a stock will trade for well above what it should. When I buy the S&P index at a fair price for 1000 (through an etf or fund) and years later it's 1400, the gain isn't out of someone else's pocket, else the amount of wealth in the world would be fixed and that's not the case. Over time, investors lag the market return for multiple reasons, trading costs, bad timing, etc. Statements such as \"\"90% lose money\"\" are hyperbole meant to separate you from your money. A self fulfilling prophesy.   The question of lagging the market is another story - I have no data to support my observation, but I'd imagine that well over 90% lag the broad market. A detailed explanation is too long for this forum, but simply put, there are trading costs. If I invest in an S&P ETF that costs .1% per year, I'll see a return of say 9.9% over decades if the market return is 10%. Over 40 years, this is 4364% compounded, vs the index 4526% compounded, a difference of less than 4% in final wealth. There are load funds that charge more than this just to buy in (5% anyone?).  Lagging by a small fraction is a far cry from 'losing money.'  There is an annual report by a company named Dalbar that tracks investor performance. For the 20 year period ending 12/31/10 the S&P returned 9.14% and Dalbar calculates the average investor had an average return of 3.83%. Pretty bad, but not zero. Since you don't cite a particular article or source, there may be more to the story. Day traders are likely to lose. As are a series of other types of traders in other markets, Forex for one.  While your question may be interesting, its premise of \"\"many experts say....\"\" without naming even one leaves room for doubt.  Note - I've updated the link for the 2015 report.

But only in certain narrow segments (and most folks would rightly want traders to be counted as a separate beast than an 'investor').  In most segments, it's not true that most investors lose money, but it still is true that most investors exhibit consistent biases that allow for mispricing. I think that understanding the heuristics and biases approach to economics is critical, both because it helps you understand why there are inefficiencies, and also because it helps you understand that quantitative, principled investing is not voodoo black magic; it's simply applying mathematics for the normative part and experimental observations for the descriptive part to yield a business strategy, much like any other way of making money.\"",

The majority of us as humans are not wired to naturally make the kinds of rigorous and quick decisions that markets require, especially if day trading.

Update: with the hint from the OP to google \"\"90% investors lose their money\"\" it is clear that \"\"experts\"\" on complex trading systems are claiming that the 90% of the people that try similar systems, fail to make money. Therefore try their system, for a fee. The statements are being made by people who have what should be an obvious bias.\"",

At least here in Europe I can trade index CFD's and other leveraged products. If i trade lets say >50:1 leverage it doesn\u2019t take much to get a margin call and/or position closed by the broker. No doubt, depending on which investments you choose there\u2019s always risk, but currency is a position too. TO answer the question, I find it very unlikely that >90% of investors (referring to stocks) lose money / purchasing power. Anyway, I would not deny that where speculators (not investors) use leverage or try to trade swings, news etc. have a very high risk of losing money (purchasing power)."

        "question": "What is the US Fair Tax?",
        "answer": "The US Fair Tax is a proposal to replace the US income tax system with a sales tax. According to the document, it suggests that this would lead to significant changes like eliminating the tax advantages of 401ks and Roth IRAs over non-retirement investments, and mortgages would no longer have a tax advantage. Luxury items would become more expensive under this system. Furthermore, the transition to a Fair Tax system would require people to adapt to paying the tax at the point of sale rather than their income being taxed via paychecks. Moreover, it could impact people working in income tax-related jobs and modifying consumer behavior because the Federal government could incentivize certain spending through deductions. The Fair Tax is intended to reduce tax collection noncompliance and attempts to include more people in the tax system, like those who currently avoid income tax but would still pay sales tax on purchases.\n\nThe document adds that the Fair Tax is similar to a Value Added Tax (VAT), which is used in many countries, but it points out criticisms such as potential avoidance by moving spending or investing overseas, as well as the risks of wealthy people not contributing to the tax base if they spend and invest outside the US. The idea behind the Fair Tax is that it would tax spending rather than income, but concerns are raised that this could lead to offshoring of consumption, thus potentially harming the US economy .",

That's similar to the way people avoid paying sales tax now, except that it will be in orders of magnitude. Why should a corporation by office supplies in the US, if it has a branch in China?

I've mentioned living elsewhere down below, and that also got me thinking of how I personally would certainly gain from that ridiculous thing called \"\"Fair Tax\"\". Basically, that's exactly how the \"\"rich folks\"\", those who push for it, will gain from it. Being able to move money out of the US basically makes it a perfect tax shelter. You don't pay taxes on the income (that you have in the US), and you don't pay taxes on the spendings (that you have elsewhere, because in that country income is taxable so you only pay VAT or sales taxes). This means that all the wealthy people, while investing and gaining money from the American economy (stocks, property, etc), will actually not be spending it in the US. Thus, no taxes paid to the US, dollars flowing out. Perfect. Actually, I should be all for this stupid idea.

Even if they are only able to restructure the debt, its likely that bondholders will need to accept large concessions. However, this may not be immediately reflected in bond prices as it's very possible that the market for these bonds will be very limited in terms of who they could sell them to. If you were to buy them now , that would be a bet on some outcome other than bankruptcy and the discharge of the city's long-term obligations. President Obama has already stated that he monitoring the situation, and it seems unlikely to me that after all of the support given to the auto industry in the last several years that the federal government will do nothing, if only to avert job losses. However, I think it's likely that state aid will be limited at best, as Michigan's economy has been struggling for a number of years. There aren't many large precedents to look at for guidance. One of the largest public entities to declare bankruptcy, Orange County, was a very different situation because this was due to malfeasance on the part of its investment manager, whereas Detroit's situation is a much larger structural problem with its declining economy and tax base. I think the key question will be whether the Federal Government will consider a Detroit bankruptcy to be a large enough embarassment/failure to take significant action."

        "answer": "The importance of a cash emergency fund traditionally includes the ability to cover unexpected expenses without needing to borrow money. In cases where you might lose your job, an emergency fund helps cover costs while you search for new employment. Cutting back on non-essential expenses can extend the duration of this fund, but one critical expense you typically cannot cut is health insurance\u2014whether continuing an employer's policy with COBRA or purchasing insurance through something like the Obamacare/ACA market. However, in scenarios where healthcare is nationalized and therefore provided by the state without direct cost to individuals, the size of the emergency fund required for health insurance purposes specifically could be reduced, since securing health insurance would not be a concern.\n\nSo, while the fundamental purpose of an emergency fund does not change with nationalized healthcare\u2014since it's still meant to cover unexpected expenses and basic living costs\u2014the portion of the fund previously allocated to health insurance expenditure could potentially be reallocated to other areas or might allow for a smaller overall emergency fund, assuming no other factors change.",

But having health insurance doesn't change the fact that an emergency fund is a good idea. There are many ways to go broke!",
            "The issue is how likely you will have zero income for six months, and what are your monthly expenses. If you know the maximum medical bill you face that may allow you to save a smaller amount. But you still have to protect for that loss of income. The interuption could be because of job loss, medical emergency, or other family crisis.  If I told you that  the chances you would face a crisis dropped by 50%, would you decide that the need for an emergency fund went away? Or would you still create a fund? I think the need still exists just to avoid the downside if you aren't prepared.",
            "There are, of course, many possible financial emergencies. They range from large medical expenses to losing your job to being sued to major home or car repairs to who-knows-what. I suppose some people are in a position where the chances that they will face any sort of financial emergency are remote. If you live in a country with national health insurance and there is near-zero chance that you will have any need to go outside this system, you are living with your parents and they are equipped to handle any home repairs, you ride the bus or subway and don't own a car so that's not an issue, etc etc, maybe there just isn't any likely scenario where you'd suddenly need cash. I can think of all sorts of scenarios that might affect me. I'm trying to put my kids through college, so if I lost my job, even if unemployment benefits were adequate to live on, they wouldn't pay for college. I have terrible health insurance so big medical bills could cost me a lot. I have an old car so it could break down any time and need expensive repairs, or even have to be replaced. I might suddenly be charged with a crime that I didn't commit and need a lawyer to defend me. Etc. So in a very real sense, everyone's situation is different. On the other hand, no matter how carefully you think it out, it's always possible that you will get bitten by something that you didn't think of. By definition, you can't make a list of unforeseen problems that might affect you! So no matter how safe you think you are, it's always good to have some emergency fund, just in case.

        "question": "Do high interest rates lead to higher bond yields or lower?",
        "answer": "High interest rates generally lead to higher bond yields. Here's why:\n\nWhen central banks increase interest rates, it typically happens in response to concerns about inflation or an overheating economy. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can slow down economic growth and cool off inflation.\n\nFor bonds, the interest rate is a crucial factor for determining their yield. Existing bonds with fixed interest rates become less attractive when new bonds are issued with higher rates because the new bonds pay more income to the investor. Therefore, in order to remain competitive in the market, the prices of existing bonds tend to fall so that their yields increase and become more attractive to potential buyers. This fall in price thus raises the yield of the existing bond, aligning it with the current higher interest rate environment.\n\nConversely, if interest rates are lowered, new bonds are issued with lower yields, making existing bonds with higher fixed interest rates more attractive. This increased demand can lead to a rise in the price of the existing bonds, and their yields will decrease as a result.\n\nTherefore, there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices, which means when interest rates go up, bond prices typically go down, causing yields to go up, and vice versa.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"It is important to distinguish between cause and effect as well as the supply (saving) versus demand (borrowing) side of money to understand the relationship between interest rates, bond yields, and inflation. What is mean by \"\"interest rates\"\" is usually based on the officially published rates determined by the central bank and is referenced to the overnight lending rate for meeting reserve requirements.  In practice, what the means is, (for example) in the United States the Federal Reserve will have periodic meetings to determine whether to leave this rate alone or to raise or lower the rate.  The new rate is generally determined by their assessment of current and forecast national and global economic conditions and factors in the votes of the various Regional Federal Reserve Presidents.  If the Fed anticipates economic weakness they will tend to lower and keep rates lower, while when the economy seems to be overheated the tendency will be to raise rates. Bond yields are also based on the expectation of future economic conditions, but as determined by market participants.  At times the market will actually \"\"lead\"\" the Fed in bidding bond prices up or down, while at other times it will react after the Fed does.  However, ignoring the varying time lag the two generally will track each other because they are really the same thing.  The only difference is the participants which are collectively determining what the rates/yields are. The inverse relationship between interest rates and inflation is the main reason for fluctuating rates in the first place.  The Fed will tend to raise rates to try to slow inflation, and lower rates when it feels inflation is too low and economic growth should be stimulated.  Likewise, when the economy is doing poorly there is both little inflationary pressure (driving interest rates down both in terms of what savers can accept to keep ahead of inflation and at) and depressed levels of borrowing (reduced demand for money, driving down rates to try to balance supply and demand), and the opposite is true when the economy is booming. Bond yields are thus positively correlated to inflation because during periods of high inflation savers won't want to invest in bonds that don't provide them with an acceptable inflation adjusted yield.  But high interest rates tend to have the effect or reining in inflation because it gets more costly for borrowers and thus puts a damper on new economic activity. So to summarize,\"",
            "Imagine that the existing interest rate is 5%. So on a bond with face value of 100, you would be getting a $5 coupon implying a 5% yield. Now, if let's say the interest rates go up to 10%, then a new bond issued with a face value of 100 will give you a coupon of $10 implying a 10% yield. If someone in the bond market buys your bond after interest price adjustment, in order to make the 10% yield (which means that an investor typically targets at least the risk-free rate on his investments) he needs to buy your bond at $50 so that a $5 coupon can give a 10% yield. The reverse happens when interest rates go down. I hope this somewhat clears the picture. Yield = Coupon/Investment Amount Update: Since the interest rate of the bond does not change after its issuance, the arbitrage in the interest rate is reflected in the market price of the bond. This helps in bringing back the yields of old bonds in-line with the freshly issued bonds."

        "question": "How much is inflation?",
        "answer": "The exact rate of inflation can vary based on location and time. In general, inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This index uses a basket of goods that are purchased each year to determine the change in prices and give a representative idea of inflation from the perspective of a regular consumer .\n\nTo find the current inflation rate, you would typically look up the latest release from the Consumer Price Index for the relevant country. For example, in Canada, you can find current CPI information at Statistics Canada, and the Bank of Canada maintains an online Inflation Calculator that can help determine the purchasing power of a dollar amount on a past date compared to today's dollars .\n\nHowever, this document does not provide the current rate of inflation.

There are differences in inflation between the U.S. and Canada because our currencies are different, and there may be different items in the \"\"basket\"\" of goods that constitutes the index. You can find current information on the Canadian CPI at Statistics Canada, here: Latest release from the Consumer Price Index. Also, the Bank of Canada \u2013 our central bank \u2013 maintains a free online Inflation Calculator.  The BoC's inflation calculator is handy because you can enter a dollar amount for a past date and it will figure out what that would be in today's dollars.

And you're right \u2013 if you get a salary increase that is less than the rate of inflation, then in theory you have lost purchasing power.  So, anybody really looking for a raise ought to make an effort to get more than the increase in CPI.  Of course, some employers are counting on you not knowing that, because any increase that's less than CPI is effectively a salary decrease; which could mean more profit for them, if they are able to increase their prices / revenues at inflation or better. Finally, consider that salary & wage increases also contribute to inflation!  Perhaps you've heard of the wage/price inflation spiral.  If you haven't, there's more on that here and here.\"",
            "FYI...prices don't always go up.  Inflation is a monetary phenomenon.  I'm simplifying greatly here: if more money is printed (or the money supply increases through fractional reserve banking) and it is chasing the same amount of goods then prices will go up.  Conversely, if money is held constant and the economy becomes more productive, producing more goods, then a constant amount of money is chasing an increasing amount of goods and prices go down. After the Civil War the greenback went back to being on a gold standard in 1879.  After 1879 greenbacks could be redeemed for gold.  Gold restricts money growth since it is difficult to obtain. Here are the price and wage indexes from 1869 - 1889 (from here):  Notice from 1879 to 1889 that wholesale and consumer prices fall but wages start to increase.  Imagine your salary staying the same (or even increasing) but the prices of items falling. Still don't think inflation is a monetary phenomenon?  Here is a CPI chart from 1800 to 2007:  Notice how the curve starts to go drastically up around 1970.  What happen then?

            "\"Nobel laureate economist, Paul Krugman, wrote a piece many moons ago about economic expansion and money supply.  As an illustration of how money supply affects the economy, he used the example of a baby-sitting co-op.  While simplistic, it provides an easy to grasp notion of how printing money and restricting it (e.g. by pegging the currency to gold reserves) can affect the economy. Here is an excerpt from his webpage ( http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/howfast.html ): \"\"With the decline of the traditional extended family, in which relatives were available to take care of children at need, many parents in the United States have sought alternative arrangements. A popular scheme is the baby-sitting coop, in which a group of parents agree to help each other out on a reciprocal basis, with each parent serving both as baby-sitter and baby-sittee. Any such coop requires rules that ensure that all members do their fair share. One natural answer, at least to people accustomed to a market economy, is to use some kind of token or marker system: parents \"\"earn\"\" tokens by babysitting, then in turn hand over these tokens when their own children are minded by others. For example, a recently formed coop in Western Massachusetts uses Popsicle sticks, each representing one hour of babysitting. When a new parent enters the coop, he or she receives an initial allocation of ten sticks.  This system is self-regulating, in the sense that it automatically ensures that over any length of time a parent will put in more or less the same amount of time that he or she receives. It turns out, however, that establishing such a token system is not enough to make a coop work properly. It is also necessary to get the number of tokens per member more or less right. To see why, suppose that there were very few tokens in circulation. Parents will want on average to hold some reserve of tokens - enough to deal with the possibility that they may want to go out a few times before they have a chance to babysit themselves and earn more tokens. Any individual parent can, of course, try to accumulate more tokens by babysitting more and going out less. But what happens if almost everyone is trying to accumulate tokens - as they will be if there are very few in circulation? One parent's decision to go out is another's opportunity to babysit. So if everyone in the coop is trying to add to his or her reserve of tokens, there will be very few opportunities to babysit. This in turn will make people even more reluctant to go out, and use up their precious token reserves; and the level of activity in the coop may decline to a disappointingly low level.  The solution to this problem is, of course, simply to issue more Popsicle sticks. But not too many - because an excess of popsicle sticks can pose an equally severe problem. Suppose that almost everyone in the coop has more sticks than they need; then they will be eager to go out, but reluctant to babysit. It will therefore become hard to find babysitters - and since opportunities to use popsicle sticks will become rare, people will become even less willing to spend time and effort earning them. Too many tokens in circulation, then, can be just as destructive as too few.\"\" -- Paul Krugman, 1997 (accessed webpage 2010).\""

        "question": "Should I always hold short term bonds till maturity?",
        "answer": "Holding short-term bonds until maturity is not always necessary, and whether to do so can depend on interest rate environments and individual investment strategies. At shorter maturities, the impact of interest rate changes on bond prices is relatively negligible because future cash inflows are being discounted by such a low amount. For instance, the one month bill rarely moves in price beyond the bid/ask spread during economic expansion, and, as such, it can be expected to have stable pricing except potentially before a recession .\n\nHowever, it is essential to understand that the yield is not the whole story when it comes to bonds. As the maturity date approaches, the market price of the bond will approach its nominal price, which is the price at which the government or the issuer will buy back the bond at maturity. If you buy a bond at a price higher than its nominal value, you will experience a capital loss if you hold it to maturity since the market price will tend to converge toward that lower nominal value. This capital loss should be netted off against the interest received to get what is known as the gross redemption yield .\n\nInvestors need to consider the entire return, which includes interest received during the holding period and any gains or losses due to price movements. If sold before maturity, a bond's price could have either appreciated or depreciated depending on the interest rate movements and market conditions. Consequently, investors might sell bonds before maturity for various reasons, including reacting to market conditions, adjusting their investment portfolio, realizing capital gains, or limiting capital losses.\n\nIn summary, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to whether one should always hold short-term bonds until maturity, as it depends on a multitude of factors including market conditions, interest rate movements, investment goals, and individual risk tolerance. It's critical to perform careful analysis and potentially consult with a financial advisor to understand the implications of holding or selling bonds before maturity in the context of your specific investment strategy.",

Here are a few considerations based on the information found in the document:\n\n1. **Contact the charity**: For larger donations, directly contacting the charity can ensure that you use the method of donation that is most beneficial to them. This can prevent unnecessary costs and ensure that the maximum amount of your donation goes toward the charity's cause .\n\n2. **Donate appreciated equities**: In the United States, if you're considering a large donation to a tax-exempt organization (like a 501(c)(3)), you might want to donate appreciated equities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual fund shares. This way, you can claim a tax deduction for the value at the time of transfer and avoid paying capital gains tax. The charity, if tax-exempt, benefits from the full value of the donation .\n\n3. **Consider payment methods**: It is advisable to donate using methods that are cost-effective and efficient for charities. For example, sending donations via Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments can be more efficient than checks, which are becoming increasingly outdated and costly for organizations to process .\n\n4. **Research the charities**: Use ratings or watchdog groups that monitor charities to ensure that the organization you choose is legitimate and that they meet criteria such as having an independent board of directors and keeping fundraising and administrative costs within reasonable limits .\n\nThese strategies can help you ensure that your contribution is used effectively by the charity and indeed makes a difference.

The only shortcut I know to tell if a charity is legitimate is to consult one of the ratings/watchdog type groups that monitor charities. For example, for explicitly Christian charities, there's a group called the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. To be a member in good standing a charity has to meet a bunch of criteria, like having an independent board of directors, i.e. you can't start a charity, make yourself the president and your brother-in-law the vice president and you're not answerable to anyone else; their fund-raising and administrative costs can't be more than a certain percentage of total income, etc. There are similar groups with similar standards for more general charities.

Of course a fraud could make up beautiful flyers describing all the wonderful work they do, with pictures of people they helped and detailed case histories, and it's all complete fiction. But that's more work than most con men go to. I've gotten lots of pleas for contributions from people who call on the phone or come to my door or send an email. If the message does not have a logo, a mailing address and phone number, reasonably coherent English, and a fair amount of text describing what they do, I don't give them anything. They COULD be a new start up that hasn't had time to prepare these things. They COULD believe that pretty flyers are a waste of money and they want to put all their resources into helping the needy. But more likely it's a scam that somebody through together in his basement. Of course the best thing is if you personally know people who are officers in the organization. (Well, assuming you personally know them AND you know that they are honest people. If you know the president and you know he's a sleazy con man, you might want to stay away from that group.) See if you can find information about the charity in the news or on-line. If they're being investigated for fraud by the Justice Department, you might want to avoid them. Etc. Maybe you've thought this through, but you also might want to think about exactly who in Greece you want to help, and what your philosophy of charity is. Do you want to help people who lost their jobs because of the economic problems there and who are now unemployed? Do you want to donate to the government to help them balance the budget? Do you want to help support an orphanage or a homeless shelter, or give money directly to needy people? Etc. And one piece of unsolicited advice: Unless you have millions to give -- and I'm assuming you don't as you said your first gift would be $50 -- I'd pick one or two charities and give regularly to them. I think you can do more good by giving $X per month to a single charity than to give to a different charity every month. You make more difference.",

        "answer": "The information provided in the document does not directly answer the question about the likelihood of getting a lower interest rate by calling and asking being affected by recent credit card regulations. However, it does detail that interest rates are generally raised when inflation picks up as a way to control inflation. This could imply that if recent regulations were put in place in a context of rising inflation, credit card companies might be less inclined to lower interest rates upon request, as the rates are part of the monetary policy toolkit to address inflationary pressures.\n\nWithout specific information on the recent credit card regulations in question, it's challenging to determine their exact impact on the ability to negotiate lower interest rates. Regulations may affect credit card interest rates in several ways, such as changes to how interest rates are calculated or imposed limits, but the document does not provide details on such regulations.

        "question": "Is investing exlusively in a small-cap index fund a wise investment?",
        "answer": "Investing exclusively in any single asset class, including a small-cap index fund, comes with certain risks and considerations. While I can provide some general observations on the matter, it's important to note that I am a chatbot and not a certified financial advisor. Here are some factors to consider when thinking about investing exclusively in a small-cap index fund:\n\n1. Diversification: Small-cap index funds concentrate on the smaller segment of the market, which means they lack the diversification found in broader market index funds. While small-cap stocks can offer high growth potential, they are often more volatile and can be riskier than large-cap stocks.\n\n2. Volatility: Small-cap stocks tend to be more sensitive to economic changes and can experience greater price swings. This could lead to higher potential returns, but also higher risk of loss.\n\n3. Growth Potential: Small-cap companies generally have more room to grow than larger, established companies. This growth potential can be attractive to investors looking for higher returns.\n\n4. Industry Concentration: Small-cap indices might have a different industry concentration compared to broader market indices. This can be beneficial if the concentrated industries perform well, but it can also add risk if those industries suffer.\n\n5. Market Cycles: Different market caps perform differently during various phases of the economic cycle. Depending on the timing and economic conditions, small caps could either outperform or underperform the broader market.\n\n6. Long-Term Investment: Small-cap stocks may perform well over the long term, but in the short term, their performance can be erratic. Investors should be prepared for the possibility of a long investment horizon to ride out periods of underperformance.\n\n7. Costs: Index funds usually have low management fees, which is a benefit. However, it's still important to be aware of any fees associated with the specific small-cap index fund you're considering.\n\nIt's important to consider your own financial situation, investment goals, risk tolerance, and the need for portfolio diversification. Many financial advisors recommend holding a mix of different asset classes to mitigate risk. Before making any investment decisions, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "In a word, no. Diversification is the first rule of investing.  Your plan has poor diversification because it ignores most of the economy (large cap stocks).  This means for the expected return your portfolio would get, you would bear an unnecessarily large amount of risk.  Large cap and small cap stocks take turns outperforming each other.  If you hold both, you have a safer portfolio because one will perform well while the other performs poorly.  You will also likely want some exposure to the bond market. A simple and diversified portfolio would be a total market index fund and a total bond market fund.  Something like 60% in the equity and 40% in the bonds would be reasonable.  You may also want international exposure and maybe exposure to real estate via a REIT fund. You have expressed some risk-aversion in your post.  The way to handle that is to take some of your money and keep it in your cash account and the rest into the diversified portfolio. Remember, when people add more and more asset classes (large cap, international, bonds, etc.) they are not increasing the risk of their portfolio, they are reducing it via diversification.  The way to reduce it even more (after you have diversified) is to keep a larger proportion of it in a savings account or other guaranteed investment. BTW, your P2P lender investment seems like a great idea to me, but 60% of your money in it sounds like a lot.",
            "Stock portfolios have diversifiable risk and undiversifiable risk.  The market rewards investors for taking undiversifiable risk (e.g. owning an index of oil producing companies) and does not reward investors for assuming diversifiable risk (e.g. owning a single oil producing company).  The market will not provide investors with any extra return for owning a single oil company when they can buy an oil index fund at no additional cost. Similarly, the market will not reward you for owning a small-cap index fund when you can purchase a globally diversified / capitalization diversified index fund at no additional cost.  This article provides a more detailed description. The Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund is a much better staring point for an equity portfolio. You will need to make sure that the asset allocation of your overall portfolio (e.g. stocks, bonds, P2P lending, cash) is consistent with your time horizon (5-10 years).",

The advice on \"\"diversifying\"\" in the other answers is the standard \"\"investment advisor\"\" response to beginner's questions, and has two advantages for the advisor: (1) they won't get sued for giving bad advice and (2) they can make a nice fat commission selling you some very-average-performance products (and note they are selling you \"\"investment industry products,\"\" not necessarily \"\"good investment opportunities\"\" - advisors get paid commission and bonuses for selling more stuff, not for selling good stuff).  My advice would be to drip-feed some of your excess income into the emerging market sector (maybe 1/3 or 1/4 of the excess), with the intention of leaving it there untouched for up to 20 or 30 years, if need be. At some unknown future time, it is almost certain there will be another EM \"\"boom,\"\" if only because people have short memories. When that happens, sell up, take your profits, and do something less risky with them.  You might consider putting another slice of your excess income into the commodities sector. I don't know when the oil price will be back at $150 or $200 a barrel, but I would be happy to bet it will happen sometime in the OP's lifetime... Since you apparently have plenty of income and are relatively young, that is the ideal time to adopt a risky investment strategy. Even if you lose your entire investment over the next 5 years, you still have another 20 years to recover from that disaster. If you were starting to invest at age 56 rather than 26, the risk/reward situation would be very different, of course.\""

        "answer": "When considering investments that can potentially provide returns forever, it's important to note that there are no guarantees in investing. However, some options may offer a level of safety and ongoing returns. According to the document provided, the closest option to a guaranteed return might be a bank account, as it will provide the stated return unless there's an economy-wide financial failure, but the returns may be very small.

These are classic choices that don't require ongoing time commitments, unlike stocks or real estate which may stop generating income due to various market forces. Thinking about your goals and expectations from the returns will guide you better in choosing the right investment path.

        "question": "What intrinsic, non-monetary value does gold have as a commodity?",
        "answer": "The intrinsic, non-monetary value of gold can be contentious and somewhat philosophical in nature. The document provided argues that while gold is often considered a valuable currency due to its desirable physical characteristics, these do not confer an intrinsic value per se. Just as any currency, gold is only worth what someone is willing to trade for it, and its value is determined by the economy, not by the medium serving as the currency.\n\nYet, gold does have intrinsic uses, which mostly pertain to industrial applications. These include uses in aerospace, computers, electronics, dentistry, and medicine. It's noted that gold belongs to the same chemical family as copper and silver, which allows it to serve most of their uses, although not always as effectively. Importantly, most of these applications have far cheaper substitutes. If you set aside its usage for jewelry and coinage, the appeal of gold is primarily in these sectors.\n\nThe concept of 'intrinsic value' itself is challenged in the document; it's argued that intrinsic value is essentially a perceived notion, which holds that something is worth what people collectively determine it to be worth. This intrinsic value is not tied to anything concrete in reality and is analogous to assigning value to an intangible asset like a copyright.\n\nWith respect to gold, barring a small percentage (approximately 10%) of production that goes towards industrial uses, it lacks intrinsic value beyond its aesthetic appeal and rarity. If one were to exclude its roles in investment and jewelry\u2014of which the latter is often culturally significant\u2014the remaining industrial and dental applications would not sustain the high price levels that gold currently commands. Moreover, consumption of gold for industrial use has been decreasing over recent years, which complicates attributing its high value to these applications.\n\nIn summary, the non-monetary value of gold is a mix of tangible applications in various industries and a complex web of perceptions about its worth, influenced by its rarity and beauty. However, it should be noted that these industrial uses could not justify current gold prices if the demand for jewelry and the function of gold as a store of value were removed.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The answer is that other than a small number of applications (the approx. 10% of gold production that goes to 'industrial uses') gold does not have intrinsic value beyond being pretty and rare (and useful for making jewelry.)  There are a number of 'industrial' applications and uses for gold (see other answers for a list) but the volume consumed this way is fairly small, especially relative to the capacity to mine new gold and reclaim existing gold. If you removed investment, and jewelry usage (especially culturally driven jewelry usage) then there's no way the remaining uses for industry and dentistry could sustain the price levels we currently see for gold.  Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, the best data I can find for this shows the total number of tons consumed for industrial uses has been shrinking for several years now, and that was prior to recent price increases, so it is difficult to tie that reduced demand to increasing prices.  And one might postulate in a 'collapsed society' you seem to be referring to in your question, that a lot of the recent industrial demand (e.g. the '50 cents of gold in each cellphone') could quite possibly disappear entirely.   The argument many people use for gold having value is usually 'been used as money for thousands of years'.  But this confuses gold having a value of its own with the reasons why something makes a useful currency.  Gold has a large number of characteristics that make it an ideal currency, and of all the elements available it is perhaps the best physical element to serve as a currency. BUT just as with a dollar bill, just because it is a good currency, does NOT give it an intrinsic value. Any currency is only worth what someone will trade you for it.  The value is set by the economy etc., not the medium used as a currency.   So yes, people will probably always use gold as money, but that doesn't make the money worth anything, it's just a medium of exchange. Incidentally two other things should be noted.  The first is that you have a problem when the medium itself used for a currency becomes worth more than the face value.  Hence why we stopped using silver in coins, and there were concerns over pennies due to the price of copper. This leads to the second point, which is that currently, gold is TOO RARE to suffice as a world currency, hence why all countries went off the gold standard years ago.  The size of national and global economies was growing faster than the supply of gold, and hence it was becoming impossible to have enough gold to back all the currencies (inflation concerns aside).",
            "Borrowing Wikipedia for a bit, it seems like the intrinsic uses are these. I've ordered these approximately in technology-level order: The importance of any of these uses largely depends on the state of a civilization and the level of technology of that civilization. However, most of these applications have far cheaper substitutes available.",
            "This site shows a list of (mostly) industrial uses of gold:  http://geology.com/minerals/gold/uses-of-gold.shtml If you ignore the first two uses, jewelry and coinage, there remains aerospace, computers, electronics, dentistry and medicine.

            "\"Extrinsic value is not a factor with respect to gold.  Intrinsic value by definition is the natural value of a commodity set by the market -- extrinsic value is externally set. The \"\"extrinsic\"\" value of gold in the United States is $50/oz. If the market value of gold fell below $50/oz, a US American Eagle coin would be worth $50 in the US. If you take away the attributes that make a commodity valuable, the value drops. Substitutes of equal or better quality for most industrial or other uses of gold exist, so if if the popularity of gold declines, or if the hoarders of gold have to liquidate, it's value will diminish. I have no idea what that value would be, but it would set by the market demand for gold jewelry and other valuable industrial uses.\"",

Intrinsic Value:  \"\"The actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value ...\"\"  Intrinsic value is perceived, which means it is worth whatever you, or a group of people, think it is. Intrinsic value has nothing, I repeat, absolutely nothing, to do with anything that exists in reality.  The most obvious example of this is the purchase of a copy-right. You are assigning an intrinsic value to a copy-right by purchasing it. However, when you purchase a copy-right you are not buying ink on a page, you are purchasing an idea.

        "answer": "As a 20-year-old with $25k to invest, there are several strategies you can consider:\n\n1. **Educate Yourself**: Before making any investments, invest in your own financial knowledge. Reading books, following companies, and tracking a virtual portfolio can be a great start. This foundational step will help you understand the market and investment options better.\n\n2. **Start with Retirement Savings**: A part of your investment could go into a retirement savings account like a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth. At your age, the power of compound interest can significantly increase your investment over time. For example, there are yearly limits on how much you can contribute to a Roth IRA, so you could contribute for the previous and current year if you haven't already maximized your contributions.\n\n3. **Diversification**: Open an additional brokerage account for the excess funds that can't be placed in the Roth IRA. This allows you to invest in a mix of assets and transfer money to the Roth IRA annually, while also managing your taxes efficiently.\n\n4. **Consider a Financial Planner**: Consulting an independent financial planner who charges per hour could be beneficial. This ensures impartial advice as they are not compensated through commissions from selling financial products.\n\n5. **Emergency Fund**: Keep a portion of your money as liquid savings for emergencies. It's commonly suggested to have about $1k in actual cash handy.\n\n6. **Long-Term Stock Investments**: Consider using a service like \"Motley Fool Stock Advisor\" which suggests stocks to invest in on a monthly basis. This can also serve as a learning experience and help you build a diversified portfolio of quality companies. However, always be careful about concentrating too much in any single stock and follow the recommended investment amounts.\n\n7. **Low-Risk Options**: Look into inflation-protected securities such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or I-Bonds which are designed to keep up with inflation.\n\n8. **Personal Comfort with Risk**: Understand your risk tolerance as you will experience both gains and losses in the market. As you age, you might want to gradually decrease your risk to preserve capital.\n\nThese suggestions provide a mix of long-term growth, education, and risk management tailored to a young investor with time to grow their investments and ride out market fluctuations .\n\nRemember, investing always comes with risks and it's important to make the decisions that best align with your personal goals and risk tolerance.",

Educate yourself as index funds are merely a strategy that could be applied to various asset classes such as US Large-cap value stocks, Emerging Market stocks, Real Estate Investment Trusts, US Health Care stocks, Short-term bonds, and many other possibilities. Could you be more specific about which funds you meant as there is some great work by Fama and French on the returns of various asset classes over time. What about a Roth IRA? Mutual fund?

You are clearly very good at managing your money, but I believe you are over-thinking your opportunity. Reading your question, you need a starting place (and some managed expectations), so here is your plan: Now that you have a personal retirement account (IRA, Roth IRA, MyRA?) and perhaps a 401(k) (or equivalent) at work, you can start to select which investments go into that account.

If you want to be more active in investing then start researching the market and stick to industries you have  very good understanding of. It's tough to invest in a market you know nothing about. I'd suggest putting at least some of that into a retirement savings account for long term growth. Make sure you look at both your short term and long term goals. Letting an investment mature from age 20 through to retirement will net you plenty of compound interest but don't forget about your short term goals like possible cars, houses and families.

            "Investing is really about learning your own comfort level.  You will make money and lose money. You will make mistakes but you will also learn a great deal. First off, invest in your own financial knowledge, this doesn't require capital at all but a commitment. No one will watch or care for your own money better than yourself. Read books, and follow some companies in a Google Finance virtual portfolio. Track how they're doing over time - you can do this as a virtual portfolio without actually spending or losing money.  Have you ever invested before? What is your knowledge level? Investing long term is about trying to balance risk while reducing losses and trying not to get screwed along the way (by people).  My personal advice: Go to an independent financial planner, go to one that charges you per hour only. Financial planners that don't charge you hourly get paid in commissions. They will be biased to sell you what puts the most money in their pockets. Do not go to the banks investment people, they are employed by the banks who have sales and quota requirements to have you invest and push their own investment vehicles like mutual funds. Take $15k to the financial planner and see what they suggest. Keep the other $5K in something slow and boring and $1k under your mattress in actual cash as an emergency. While you're young, compound interest is the magic that will make that $25k increase hand over fist in time. But you need to have it consistently make money. I'm young too and more risk tolerant because I have time. While I get older I can start to scale back my risk because I'm nearing retirement and preserve instead of try to make returns.",
            "\"I recommend a Roth IRA. At your age you could turn 25K into a million and never pay taxes on these earnings. Of course there are yearly limits (5.5k) on the amount your can contribute to a Roth IRA account. If you haven't filed your taxes this year yet ... you can contribute 5.5K for last year and 5.5K for this year.  Open two accounts at a discount brokerage firm. Trades should be about $10 or less per. Account one ... Roth IRA. Account two a brokerage account  for the excess funds that can't be placed in the Roth IRA. Each year it will be easy transfer money into the Roth from this account. Be aware that you can't transfer stocks from brokerage acct to Roth IRA ... only cash. You can sell some stocks in brokerage and turn that into cash to transfer. This means settling up with the IRS on any gains/losses on that sale. Given your situation you'd likely have new cash to bring to table for the Roth IRA anyway. Invest in stocks and hold them for the long term.

        "question": "How should I save money if the real interest rate (after inflation) is negative?",
        "answer": "In a scenario where the real interest rate (after inflation) is negative, there are several strategies you can consider to preserve the purchasing power of your money:\n\n1. **Inflation-Protected Securities**: One of the least risky ways to save money when facing negative real interest rates is to invest in inflation-protected securities like Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) or I-Bonds. These types of bonds have a fixed interest rate component and an adjustable component that changes with inflation, ensuring that your investment keeps pace with inflation .\n\n2. **Invest in Companies**: Investing in companies can provide better returns than negative real interest rates. This can be done through the stock market or by purchasing corporate bonds. Index tracker funds in the stock market have historically provided good returns with relatively low risk. On the other hand, the corporate bond market offers lower risk compared to stocks but better returns than current savings rates. Investment-grade bonds are considered low risk, especially in the current economic climate .\n\n3. **Diversify Investments**: If you're open to taking on more risk for potentially higher returns, you could diversify your investments across various asset classes, such as equities, bonds, real estate, and even commodities like gold. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a way to achieve diversification while managing risk .\n\nIt's important to remember that all investments carry some level of risk and returns are not guaranteed. It's essential to assess your own risk tolerance and financial goals before making any investment decisions. Additionally, stay informed and be cautious of any financial product or investment that you do not fully understand. The overarching aim in an environment with negative real interest rates is to find investment vehicles that can either keep pace with inflation or exceed it, so as to maintain or grow the purchasing power of your savings.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Inflation protected securities (i-bonds or TIPS).   TIPS stands for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities. By very definition, they tend to protect your savings against inflation. They won't beat inflation, but will keep up with it. TIPS or iBonds have two parts. A fixed interest part and a variable interest portion which varies depending upon the current rates. The combined rate would match the inflation rate. They can be bought directly from the treasury (or from a broker or bank who might charge a commission)",
            "\"(Real) interest rates are so low because governments want people to use their money to improve the economy by spending or investing rather than saving. Their idea is that by consuming or investing you will help to create jobs that will employ people who will spend or invest their pay, and so on. If you want to keep this money for the future you don't want to spend it and interest rates make saving unrewarding therefore you ought to invest. That was the why, now the how. Inflation protected securities, mentioned in another answer, are the least risk way to do this. These are government guaranteed and very unlikely to default. On the other hand deflation will cause bigger problems for you and the returns will be pitiful compared with historical interest rates. So what else can be done? Investing in companies is one way of improving returns but risk starts to increase so you need to decide what risk profile is right for you.  Investing in companies does not mean having to put money into the stock market either directly or indirectly (through funds) although index tracker funds have good returns and low risk. The corporate bond market is lower risk for a lesser reward than the stock market but with better returns than current interest rates. Investment grade bonds are very low risk, especially in the current economic climate and there are exchange traded funds (ETFs) to diversify more risk away. Since you don't mention willingness to take risk or the kind of amounts that you have to save I've tried to give some low risk options beyond \"\"buy something inflation linked\"\" but you need to take care to understand the risks  of any product you buy or use, be they a bank account, TIPS, bond investments or whatever. Avoid anything that you don't fully understand.\""

        "answer": "The \"Deposit Plus\" product offered by HSBC Hong Kong is a form of foreign exchange structured product, commonly referred to as a Dual Currency Product. It is linked to the performance of currencies and revolves around the selling of options, which could provide additional interest for the holder. However, it carries risks; if the associated currency, such as the Australian Dollar (AUD) in this scenario, declines, then the holder could lose money. This is because the savings and any earned interest would be converted to AUD at a pre-agreed contractual rate when one takes the \"Deposit Plus\" account. It's important to note that this product is not covered by the Deposit Insurance System in Hong Kong .\n\nWhen considering using the \"Deposit Plus\" product or similar financial instruments, it is crucial to read the fine print and understand the associated risks. Given that there could be significant financial losses just as there could be gains, it might not be suitable for everyone. For some, using a multicurrency account, where convertible currencies can earn interest in the selected currency, could be a better option since it generally does not involve leveraged forex accounts that could potentially lead to rapid and substantial losses.\n\nRegarding strategies to employ for dealing with products like \"Deposit Plus,\" the key considerations are to:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the product, including the fine print and the associated risks.\n2. Assess whether you are comfortable with the currency risk involved and whether the potential returns justify that risk.\n3. Consider alternatives, such as multicurrency accounts, which might provide a more straightforward way to deal with foreign currencies and earn interest.\n4. Be aware of regulatory obligations, especially if you are a US citizen, such as IRS form TD F 90-22.1 for reporting foreign accounts with over $10,000 and keeping track of regulations like the \"foreign account tax compliance act.\"\n\nRemember that high leverage can lead to significant losses just as it can amplify gains, so it's generally advisable to be cautious with products offering high leverage ratios.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s always prudent to consult with a financial advisor or professional to ensure that any investment suits your risk profile and financial goals.",

            "\"HSBC, Hang Seng, and other HK banks had a series of special savings account offers when I lived in HK a few years ago.  Some could be linked to the performance of your favorite stock or country's stock index. Interest rates were higher back then, around 6% one year.  What they were effectively doing is taking the interest you would have earned and used it to place a bet on the stock or index in question.  Technically, one way this can be done, for instance, is with call options and zero coupon bonds or notes.  But there was nothing to strategize with once the account was set up, so the investor did not need to know how it worked behind the scenes... Looking at the deposit plus offering in particular, this one looks a little more dangerous than what I describe.  See, now we are in an economy of low almost zero interest rates.  So to boost the offered rate the bank is offering you an account where you guarantee the AUD/HKD rate for the bank in exchange for some extra interest.  Effectively they sell AUD options (or want to cover their own AUD exposures) and you get some of that as extra interest.  Problem is, if the AUD declines, then you lose money because the savings and interest will be converted to AUD at a contractual rate that you are agreeing to now when you take the deposit plus account.  This risk of loss is also mentioned in the fine print. I wouldn't recommend this especially if the risks are not clear. If you read the fine print, you may determine you are better off with a multicurrency account, where you can change your HK$ into any currency you like and earn interest in that currency. None of these were \"\"leveraged\"\" forex accounts where you can bet on tiny fluctuations in currencies.  Tiny being like 1% or 2% moves.  Generally you should beware anything offering 50:1 or more leverage as a way to possibly lose all of your money quickly.

        "question": "Why government bonds fluctuate so much, even though interest rates don't change that often?",
        "answer": "Government bonds can fluctuate in price significantly even with small changes in interest rates due to the way future cash flows from the bonds are valued. Specifically, long-term government bonds experience price changes because many years of cash inflows are heavily influenced by the discounting process, which is more sensitive in a low-interest-rate environment. For instance, if we consider the present value of a bond's principal repayment over a long period, like 30 years, even a small fluctuation in the interest rates can substantially change its present value due to the compound effect of discounting over many periods.\n\nIn periods of low-interest rates, even a minimal increase in interest rates can lead to a relatively large drop in the bond's price. This is because the present value of future payments becomes significantly less when discounted at the higher rate. The effect is more pronounced for long-term bonds than for short-term bonds, where future cash inflows are discounted over a shorter period and thus are less sensitive to interest rate changes.\n\nSo, the seemingly large fluctuations in government bonds in response to interest rate changes are a reflection of the underlying math of bond valuation, which incorporates the time value of money over the lifespan of the bond's payments.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Long term gov't bonds fluctuate in price with a seemingly small interest rate fluctuation because many years of cash inflows are discounted at low rates.  This phenomenon is dulled in a high interest rate environment. For example, just the principal repayment is worth ~1/3, P * 1/(1+4%)^30, what it will be in 30 years at 4% while an overnight loan paying an unrealistic 4% is worth essentially the same as the principal, P * 1/(1+4%)^(1/365). This is more profound in low interest rate economies because, taking the countries undergoing the present misfortune, one can see that their overnight interest rates are double US long term rates while their long term rates are nearly 10x as large as US long term rates.  If there were much supply at the longer maturities which have been restrained by interest rates only manageable by the highly skilled or highly risky, a 4% increase on a 30% bond is only about a 20% decline in bond price while a 4% increase on a 4% bond is a 50% decrease. The easiest long term bond to manipulate quantitatively is the perpetuity where p is the price of the bond, i is the interest payment per some arbitrary period usually 1 year, and r is the interest rate paid per some arbitrary period usually 1 year.  Since they are expressly linked, a price can be implied for a given interest rate and vice versa if the interest payment is known or assumed. At a 4% interest rate, the price is At 4.04%, the price is , a 1% increase in interest rates and a 0.8% decrease in price . Longer term bonds such as a 30 year or 20 year bond will not see as extreme price movements. The constant maturity 30 year treasury has fluctuated between 5% and 2.5% to ~3.75% now from before the Great Recession til now, so prices will have more or less doubled and then reduced because bond prices are inversely proportional to interest rates as generally shown above. At shorter maturities, this phenomenon is negligible because future cash inflows are being discounted by such a low amount.  The one month bill rarely moves in price beyond the bid/ask spread during expansion but can be expected to collapse before a recession and rebound during."

        "answer": "In the event that the U.S. defaults on its debt, the direct impact on your bank money would depend on several factors. The document suggests that initially, the bondholders would be the most directly affected, as they might not receive expected payments. Interest rates might rise due to increased risk perception surrounding U.S. creditworthiness. The government might also monetize its ongoing expenses by printing more money, which could lead to inflation.\n\nIt is mentioned that if the U.S.'s credit rating is downgraded, it could potentially lead to more bank failures, in turn impacting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance payouts. The FDIC insures deposits up to certain limits, but if it's overwhelmed or lacks immediate funds due to a government default, there could be delays in accessing your insured money.\n\nMoreover, referencing past defaults in other countries, the document indicates that during such crises, withdrawals from banks might be limited, not because money is missing from accounts but because the cash supply is restricted. A default might also impact the perceived value of FDIC insurance, as it is backed by the \"full faith and credit of the USA.\" If the government defaults, there could be concerns about FDIC's capability to back up the insured accounts.\n\nIt should be noted, though, that the scenario depicted here involves many variables and hypothetical situations. A U.S. default could play out in several ways, and historical precedents in other countries may not be directly comparable due to different economic and financial circumstances. If the U.S. government were to default and if that led to your bank failing, FDIC insurance would typically protect your deposits up to the insured limit, but the actual outcome could vary based on the specifics of the situation and the government response at that time .\n\nRemember, these are precautionary considerations and not a prediction of events. The information provided is sourced from the discussions in the document and should be evaluated considering various possible outcomes and government interventions.",

            "You must mean the current debt ceiling debacle. The meaning of it is: US government is constantly borrowing money (by issuing treasury bonds) and constantly repaying some of the bonds that come to maturity, and also has other obligations it has to meet by law all the time - such as Social Security checks, bonds interest, federal employees' salaries and pensions, etc. By law, total amount of money that can be borrowed at the same time is capped. That means, there can be situation where the government needs to borrow money to pay, say, interest on existing bonds, but can not, since the limit is reached. Such situation is called a default, since the government promised to pay the interest, but is unable to do so. That does not mean the government has no money at all and will completely collapse or couldn't raise money on the market if it were permitted by law to do so (currently, the market is completely willing to buy the debt issued by US government, and with interest that is not very high, though of course that may change). It also does not mean the economy ceases to function, dollars cease to have value or banks instantly go bankrupt. But if the government breaks its promises to investors, it has various consequences such as raising the costs of borrowing in the future. Breaking promises to other people - like Social Security recipients - would also look bad and probably hurt many of them. Going back to your bank account, most probably nothing would happen to the money you store there. Even if the bank had invested 100% of the money in US treasury bonds (which doesn't really happen) they still can be sold on the open market, even if with some discount in the event of credit rating downgrade, so most probably your account would not be affected. As stated in another answer, even if the fallout of all these calamities causes a bank to fail, there's FDIC and if your money is under insured maximums you'll be getting your money back. But if your bank is one of the big ones, nothing of the sort would happen anyway - as we have seen in the past years, government would do practically anything to not allow any big bank failures.",
            "In principle, a default will have no effect on your bank account. But if the US's credit rating is downgraded, the knock-on effects might cause some more bank failures, and if the debt ceiling is still in place then the FDIC insurance might not be able to pay out immediately.",

The financial system stopped working properly for 1 month, about 30% of businesses went bankrupt because of chain effect, significant inflation and devaluation of currency. So, it is better to be prepared, because this type of processes result in unpredictable situation.",
            "If you are actually referring to all the political rhetoric and posturing over the debt ceiling issue.  That's a long ways from the US actually defaulting on paying debts.  A lot of government offices might shut down, but I expect anyone holding US debt to be paid off. (they have the printing presses after all)  If that's what you are referring to, based on the LAST time that the governement had to shut down because they didn't raise the debt ceiling, it won't be a big deal.  Last time, no debt was defaulted on, a bunch of the less essential government offices shut down for a few days, and the stock market did a collective 'meh' over the whole thing.  It was basically a non event.  I've no reason to expect it will be different this time.  (btw, where were all these republican budget cutters hiding when 10 years ago they started with a nearly balanced budget, and ended up blowing up the national debt by about 80% in 8 years time? (from roughly $6B to $11B)  I wish they'd been screaming about the debt as much then as they are now. Not that there isn't ample blame to go around, and both sides have not been spending in ways that make a drunken sailor look like the paragon of a fiscal conservative, but to hear nearly any of them tell it, their party had nothing to do with taking us from a balanced budget to the highest burn rate ever while they were in control (with a giant financial crisis through in as pure 'bonus')",
            "Government default doesn't mean that all US money is immediately worthless.  First, the bondholders will get stiffed.  Following that, interest rates will shoot up (because the US is a bad credit risk at this point) and the government will monetize its ongoing expenses -- i.e., fire up the printing presses. If you're concerned about not having access to your money, start pulling out a little extra when you get cash at an ATM.  Build it up over time until you have enough currency to weather through whatever emergency you envision with your bank account.",
            "\"FDIC is backed by the \"\"full faith and credit of the USA.\"\"  Well, if the USA defaults, the full faith and credit of the USA would in my mind be worthless, thus, so would FDIC.\"",
            "There are many different things that can happen, all or some. Taking Russia and Argentina as precedence - you may not be able to withdraw funds from your bank for some period of time. Not because your accounts will be drained, but because the cash supply will be restricted. Similar thing has also happened recently in Cyprus. However, the fact that the governments of Russia and Argentina limited the use of cash for a period of time doesn't mean that the US government will have to do the same, it my choose some other means of restraint. What's for sure is that nothing good will happen. Nothing will probably happen to your balance in the bank (Although Cyprus has shown that that is not a given either). But I'm not so sure about FDIC maintaining it's insurance if the bank fails (meaning if the bank defaults as a result of the chain effect - you may lose your money). If the government is defaulting, it might not have enough cash to take over the bank deposits. After the default the currency value will probably drop sharply (devaluation) which will lead to inflation. Meaning your same balance will be worth much less than it is now. So there's something to worry about for everyone."

        "question": "Are solar cell panels and wind mills worth the money?",
        "answer": "The worthiness of investing in solar panels and windmills seems to depend significantly on several factors, including geographical location, cost of electricity, availability of government incentives, and the cost of the technology.\n\nSolar panels, for instance, have a varying return on investment depending on the average sun-hours per day across different areas. In high sun-hour areas, a 1KW panel could generate electricity worth as much as $328 per year, but in areas with lower sun-hours, it might only generate $219 per year. The tipping point\u2014or the cost at which the purchase of solar panels promises a reasonable return\u2014seems to be considered around the installed price of $2500, aiming for a full payback over eight years without taking into account government subsidies. Moreover, solar panels have the potential to save an additional amount due to 'demand charges' from utilities that are linked to peak energy generation costs. A 1kW solar panel setup might save its owner an extra $160 per year by reducing the peak demand charged by the utility company .\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of solar panels can vary by location; for example, solar water heaters are more beneficial in sunny climates (like the southwestern states of the US or Hawaii) but may be less effective in the Northeast where the need for heating coincides with less effective sunlight during the colder seasons. With the aid of rebates on installation, carbon-reduction credits, and group purchase discounts, solar electric systems still have the potential to be profitable. It was noted that a particular individual's solar setup was expected to pay back its initial costs within four years, with the panels likely being reliable for about a decade before needing to be replaced due to degradation .\n\nAs for wind power, data centers, which are substantial energy consumers, have found it cost-effective to invest in their own wind turbines. This suggests that, at least at a larger scale and in areas with sufficient wind, wind power can be a good investment. Even at a smaller scale, people who have modest wind turbine setups have found it beneficial in cutting down on their electricity costs and planning further investments in solar as well. Generally, the return on investment for wind/solar can vary and should be calculated based on the local cost of electricity and available natural resources like wind and sun .\n\nIn conclusion, while windmills and solar panels can offer a decent return on investment, it depends heavily on individual circumstances such as location, energy demands, and eligibility for incentives. It is advisable to conduct a thorough analysis, including an audit of home energy needs and potential savings before investing in these technologies.",

            "These are two rather distinct questions; only one of which is relevant to a Money web site. In general, the investment is questionable.  Leaving aside the green feel-good factor, you need to look at a total cost of ownership (TCO) and payback on the asset.  Neither is cheap as such.  There are DIY windmill plans, but you likely still need a commercial battery charger/inverter/controller setup. Government incentives, depending on where you live, may change the story considerably.  Many jurisdictions around the globe have both incentives to install and then power-feed-in tariffs if you sell back excess power. Your latitude also has an impact on your total available solar energy, along with regular weather patterns for both cloud cover and wind. One of the cheapest solar projects can be hot-water.  Particularly if you have a pool, or even for domestic use, if you use a lot. All that said, given the green feel-good factor, if you want a small set of solar panels and have the space/budget, go ahead!  You can add more later. For the second question: it is indeed possible to live off grid.  Some remote houses do just this, and the methods to accomplish it vary.  The number one thing you need to do is work on a power budget; and be both ruthless as well as realistic.  Fridge, freezer, AC, furnace, plasma TV, etc.  Depending on your climate and preferences, these may not all be possible for an off-grid lifestyle.  (Of course, if you get a propane fridge and have a truck come by once a month, does that count as off-grid?)",
            "\"To answer the investment aspect takes a bit of math. First, solar insolation numbers:  This represents the average sun-hours per day for a given area. You can see the range from 4 to 6, or 1460 hrs to about 2190 hrs of sun per year depending on location. I believe electricity also has a range of cost, but 15 cents per KWH is a good average.  So, a 1KW panel will produce as much as $328 per year of electricity in a high sun-hrs area, but only $219 in a lower sun-hrs area.  If we agree to ignore the government subsidies and look for the stable price unaffected by outside influence, an installed price of even $2500 would produce a return of 13% and a reasonable full payback over an 8 year period.  I call this installed price a tipping point, the price where this purchase provides a decent return. Some would accept a lower return, and therefore a higher price. As duff points out, this should be treated as the post rebate/tax credit price. Those help to push the price below this point. At the price point where the energy cost per panel is below, the government intervention may be unnecessary. The power companies may find consumer owned panels are the cheapest way to clip the peak consumption which tends to be the most expensive power demand.) One can take the insolation numbers and cost of local power to produce a grid showing the return for a 1KW panel in $$/year. (At this point the cost of money kick in. The present value of $100/yr is far higher today than if short term rates were say, 8%)  Once panels drop to where they are compelling for the higher return areas, I'd expect volume to drive continued improvements in cost and better economies of scale. Initially, the need for storage isn't there, as the infrastructure is in place to drive your meter backwards if you produce more than you use. The peek sun coincides with peek demand and the electric companies are happy to have your demand go negative during those times.  Update - the conversation with Duff led me to research 'demand charge' a bit more. You see, the utility company has to have equipment to generate the peak demand, usually occurring in the early afternoon, say 12N-2PM as the sun is brightest and AC use in particular, highest. I found that Austin energy has a PDF describing the fee for this. Simply put, the last kW of demand will cost you $14.03 in summer months and $12.65 in winter. This adds to $160/yr that a 1kW panel might save the owner. Even if one does capture the full power at peak every month, $100 is still non-trivial. This factor alone justifies $1000 worth of panel cost, and as Duff points out, the government may find it cheaper to use this method to clip peak demand than by funding bigger power generators.  To summarize, the question isn't so much \"\"are they worth it\"\" as \"\"what is a xKW panel worth?\"\" (A function of annual savings and time value of money.) The ever decreasing installed cost for a given system makes solar an inevitable part of the future power technology. I am not a green tree hugging guy, but I do like to breathe fresh air as much as anyone. I'm happy with whatever role solar plays in cutting down pollution.\"",
            "\"I have personally known a family in the hills of Southern Oregon, US who lived off the electricity grid. As far as being \"\"possible\"\" yes, but easy is a certain no.  This family was very dedicated to the point of living without grid electricity.  A special built home of native field stones, careful alignment with the sun, location within the valley.  I would assume that making a normal home be off the electric grid is much more difficult.  Not impossible, but pretty darn hard.\"",
            "\"Although this isn't related to homes directly, as an IT professional I know that wind power tends to be cost effective to the point that many data centers (the massive buildings holding the servers that are the backbone of the internet) actually invest in their own wind turbines to slash costs since servers tend to be power hogs. As far as going \"\"off the grid\"\" that ultimately depends on how much wind/sun you're getting at your residence, but if you look at places like Dallas, PA, CA, and other areas where  the major hosts place centers, they're typically in areas where there's plenty of sunlight or wind. Going back to small scale thinking however, one of my contacts actually leases a colocation building in PA where he has a few server racks, and while he currently has electric there, he also owns a couple of turbines which have been powering <60% of the demand, and he's actually planning to add solar and also feed that back to the grid at a profit. So overall wind/solar definitely has the potential for a decent ROI, at both large and small levels, but performance will vary greatly from area to area.  I know that Lowes actually started advertising about carrying solar panels, so going in and asking about the performance and if you can arrange an audit of your home might be a good place to start.

            "Solar water heaters are definitely worth the money (if you live in sunny states like South-South-West or Hawaii, at least). In some countries (like Greece, Cyprus and Israel, to name a few) most people use hot water from the solar heaters almost exclusively. I pay $30-$40 a month to PG&E for the privilege. Unfortunately, in the US these heaters are much more expensive than they are in the more advanced European countries, so all the savings go to drain because of the vast price difference ($300 for a gas heater vs $2000 for a solar heater).",
            "Solar water heaters are definitely questionable in the Northeast -- the season when you most need them is also the season when they are least effective. Solar electric isn't a huge moneymaker, but with rebates on installation and carbon-reduction credits (SRECs) -- and a group purchase discount if you can get one, either at a town level or through organizations like One Block Off The Grid -- it can definitely turn a profit. Early estimate was that my setup would pay its initial costs back in 4 years, and the panels are generally considered to be good for a decade before the cells have degraded enough that the panels should be replaced. I haven't had a negative electric bill yet, but I've gotten close, and my setup is a relatively small one (eight panels facing SSE on a 45-degree roof). Admittedly I've also been working to reduce electricity use; I don't think I have an incandescent bulb left in the house."

        "question": "What can my relatives do to minimize their out of pocket expenses on their fathers estate",
        "answer": "To minimize their out-of-pocket expenses on their father's estate, your relatives have several options:\n\n1. **Hire a Lawyer**: Consulting a lawyer might aid in navigating complex provisions in the will, such as contesting clauses that restrict the sale of property or establishing trusts if needed for maintaining properties as part of the estate.\n\n2. **Abandon or Foreclose**: If the estate owns a property that cannot be sold or is not practically valuable due to mortgage burdens, it might be feasible to abandon it or let it go into foreclosure, avoiding further financial losses.\n\n3. **Reverse Mortgage**: Exploring a reverse mortgage could be a solution, especially if there's a need to accommodate unique circumstances, like the provision regarding your wife's aunt. This could provide payout while managing the property.\n\n4. **Property Management**: Contracting with a property management company to lease and maintain the house until it can be sold could be beneficial. Rent should cover the mortgage and property taxes, and the company would handle maintenance while the tenant pays for utilities.\n\n5. **Insurance**: Ensure proper insurance coverage, such as landlord insurance, to protect against potential liabilities arising from tenancy.\n\n6. **Incorporation**: Consider incorporating to separate personal finances from estate management. The company would own the property, handle expenses, and assume risks, potentially paying out to the beneficiaries as a salary or management fee.\n\n7. **Maintenance and Winterizing**: If a property is going to remain under the estate\u2019s ownership for some time, especially through the winter, ensure it's properly winterized to prevent damage and reduce ongoing costs.\n\n8. **Consult Financial Experts**: In matters like taxes, depreciation, and potential rental income, it may be worthwhile to consult with financial experts who specialize in estate or rental properties.\n\n9. **Expenses Planning**: Anticipate and plan for all potential expenses related to the property, including taxes, insurance, vacancies, repairs, capital expenditures (CapEx), utilities, lawn care, snow removal, and homeowners association (HOA) fees.\n\nBy considering these steps, your relatives might reduce or avoid out-of-pocket expenses while managing their father's estate   .",

            "\"Also the will stipulated that the house cannot be sold as long as one of my wife's aunts (not the same one who supposedly took the file cabinet) is alive. This is a turkey of a provision, particularly if she is not living in the house.  It essentially renders the house, which is mortgaged, valueless.  You'd have to put money into it to maintain the mortgage until she dies and you can sell it.   The way that I see it, you have four options: Crack that provision in the will.  You'd need to hire a lawyer for that.  It may not be possible.   Abandon the house.  It's currently owned by the estate, so leave it in the estate.  Distribute any goods and investments, but let the bank foreclose on the house.  You don't get any value from the house, but you don't lose anything either.  Your father's credit rating will take a posthumous hit that it can afford.  You may need to talk to a lawyer here as well, but this is going to be a standard problem.   Explore a reverse mortgage.  They may be able to accommodate the weird provision with the aunt and manage the property while giving a payout.  Or maybe not.  It doesn't hurt to ask.   Find a property manager in Philadelphia and have them rent out the house for you.  Google gave some results on \"\"find property management company Philadelphia\"\" and you might be able to do better while in Philadelphia to get rid of his stuff.  Again, I'd leave the house on the estate, as you are blocked from selling.  A lawyer might need to put it in a trust or something to make that work (if the estate has to be closed in a certain time period).  Pay the mortgage out of the rent.  If there's extra left over, you can either pay down the mortgage faster or distribute it.   Note that the rent may not support the mortgage.  If not, then option four is not practical.  However, in that case, the house is unlikely to be worth much net of the mortgage anyway.  Let the bank have it (option two).   If the aunt needs to move into the house, then you can give up the rental income.  She can either pay the mortgage (possibly by renting rooms) or allow foreclosure.  A reverse mortgage might also help in that situation.   It's worth noting that three of the options involve a lawyer.  Consulting one to help choose among the options might be constructive.  You may be able to find a law firm with offices in both Florida and Pennsylvania.   It's currently winter.  Someone should check on the house to make sure that the heat is running and the pipes aren't freezing.  If you can't do anything with it now, consider winterizing by turning off the water and draining the pipes.  Turn the heat down to something reasonable and unplug the refrigerator (throw out the food first).  Note that the kind of heat matters.  You may need to buy oil or pay a gas bill in addition to electricity.\"",
            "Consider contracting with a property management company to lease and maintain the house until it can be sold. Rent on the property should cover the mortgage, property taxes, etc. The property management company can handle maintenance and the tenant would be responsible for utilities.",
            "\"Sure, it's irresponsible for an executor to take actions which endanger the estate.  But what about passivity or inaction?  Put it another way.  Is it the obligation of the executor to avoid making revenue for the estate?  Think about it - what a silly idea!   Consider a 12-unit apartment building full of rent paying tenants.  A tenant gives notice and leaves.  So do 4 more.  With only 7/12 tenants, the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit.  Is that acceptable?  Heck no!  Realistically this will be managed by a property management company, and of course they'll seek new tenants, not stopping merely because the owner died.  This situation is not different; the same fiscal logic applies.  The counter-argument is usually along the lines of \"\"stuff might happen if you rent it out\"\"... true. But the stuff that happens to abandoned houses is much worse, and much more likely: squatters, teen \"\"urban explorers\"\", pot growers, copper thieves, winter pipe freeze flooding and wrecking interiors, etc.  Don't take my word on it -- ask your insurer for the cost of insuring an abandoned house vs. a rented one.  Renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants - $12,000/year on a $1000/mo. rental. And that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates.  But on an old mortgage, renting is like printing money.  That money propagates first to the estate (presumably it is holding back a \"\"fix the roof\"\" emergency fund), and then to the beneficiaries.  It means getting annual checks from the estate, instead of constantly being dunned for another repair.  But I don't care about making revenue (outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof).  Even if it was net zero, it means the maintenance is being done.  This being the point.  It is keeping the house in good repair, occupied, insured, and professionally managed -- fit and ready for the bequest's purpose: occupancy of an aunt.  What's the alternative?  Move an aunt into a house that's been 10 years abandoned?  Realistically the heirs are going to get tired/bored of maintaining the place at a total cash loss, maintenance will slip, and you'll be moving them into a neglected house with some serious issues.  That betrays the bequest, and it's not fair to the aunts. Rental is a very responsible thing to do.  The executor shouldn't fail to do it merely out of passivity.  If you decide not to do it, there needs to be a viable alternative to funding the home's decent upkeep.  (I don't think there is one).  Excluding a revenue-producing asset from the economy is an expensive thing to do.\""

        "question": "Where should I park my rainy-day / emergency fund?",
        "answer": "You have several options for parking your rainy-day or emergency fund, depending on how quickly you may need to access the funds and the level of risk you are willing to accept. Here are some common choices:\n\n1. **Money Market Funds** - These are investment funds that can be purchased with a brokerage account. An example is the Fidelity Cash Reserves. They are usually very safe and offer slightly better returns than local savings accounts but are not FDIC insured. \n\n2. **Online High-Yield Savings or Money Market Accounts** - These typically offer higher interest rates than local banks as they are online-only and save on overhead costs. They are FDIC insured, which is an advantage for security.\n\n3. **No-Penalty CDs (Certificates of Deposit)** - They can offer better rates than savings accounts without the penalties for early withdrawal that are commonly associated with traditional CDs. However, you should ensure it is truly a no-penalty CD and consider how it fits with your plans for adding money over time.\n\n4. **Rewards Checking Accounts** - Some checking accounts offer high interest rates (3% or more) if you meet certain activity requirements, such as a minimum number of debit card transactions per month or setting up direct deposit.\n\n5. **Local Credit Union or Local Bank** - For security and liquidity, a local credit union or bank can be a good option, although the interest rates might not be as high as online alternatives.\n\n6. **Specialized Savings Account** - Accounts like SmartyPig are designed for monthly contributions and can offer competitive interest rates. \n\nIt\u2019s important to read the terms and conditions carefully for any account to understand the interest rates, withdrawal restrictions, and any other requirements or limitations they may have. Also, keep in mind that liquidity and safety are usually the most important factors for an emergency fund, as you need reliable and quick access to the funds in case of unexpected expenses . \n\nFor the most current information on rates and deals, you may want to refer to resources such as Bankrate.com or follow rate changes through financial blogs or websites.",

            "\"First off, you generally want to park your emergency fund somewhere that is \"\"safe\"\", meaning something that is not subject to market fluctuations.  Your emergency fund is something you need to be able to count on when times are tough!  That rules out things like stock market investments. Secondly, you need to think about how quickly you will need access to the money.  If you have an emergency, odds are you don't want to be waiting around for weeks/months/years for the money to become available.  This rules out most fixed-term investments (Bonds, traditional CDs, etc). If you are concerned that you will need near-instant access to your emergency money, then you probably want to keep it in a Savings or Money Market Account at the same bank as your checking account.  Most banks will let you transfer money between local accounts instantly. Unfortunately, your local bank probably has pitiful interest rates for the Savings/MMA, far below the inflation rate.  This means your money will slowly lose value over time.  Be prepared to keep contributing to it! For most people, being able to draw the cash from your fund within a few days (<1 week) is sufficient.  Worst case, you charge something on your credit card, and then pay down the card when the emergency fund withdrawal arrives. If \"\"money within a few days\"\" is okay for you, there are a few options: Money Market (Mutual) Funds (not to be confused with a Money Market Account) - This is the traditional place to keep an emergency fund.  These are investment funds you can buy with a brokerage account.  An example of such a fund would be Fidelity Cash Reserves.  MMFs are not FDIC insured, so they are not exactly zero risk.  However, they are considered extremely safe.  They almost never go down in value (only a few times in the past few decades), and when they have, the fund manager or the Federal Govt stepped in to restore the value.  They usually offer slightly better return than a local savings account, and are available in taxable and non-taxable varieties. Online High-Yield Savings or Money Market Account - These are a relatively new invention.  It's basically a the same thing as what your local bank offers, but it's online-only.  No local branch means low overhead, so they offer higher interest rates (2.0% vs 0.5% for your local bank).  Some of them used to be over 5% before the economy tanked.  Like your local bank, it is FDIC insured. One bit of caution:  Some of these accounts have become \"\"gimmicky\"\" lately.  They have started to do things like promo rates for a few months, only offering the high interest rate on the first few $K deposited, limiting the amount that can be withdrawn, etc.  Be sure to read the details before you open an account! No-Penalty CDs - Certificates of Deposit usually offer a better rate than a Savings Account, but your money is locked up until the CD term is up (e.g. 36 months).  If you need to cash out before then, you pay a penalty.  Some banks have begun to offer CDs that you can cash out with no penalty at all.  These can offer better rates than the savings account.  Make sure it really is no-penalty though.  Also watch what your options are for slowly adding money over time.  This can be an issue if you want to deposit $100 from every paycheck. Rewards Checking Accounts - These are checking accounts that will pay a relatively high interest rate (3% or more) provided you generate enough activity.  Most of them will have requirements like you must have direct deposit setup with them, and you must do a minimum number of debit card transactions from the account per month.  If you can stay on top of the requirements, these can be a great deal.  If you don't stay on top of it, your interest rate usually drops back to something pitiful, though. Personally, we use the Online High-Yield Savings Account for our emergency fund.  I'm not going to make a specific recommendation as to which bank to use.  The best deal changes almost week to week.  Instead, I will say to check out Bankrate.com for a list of savings accounts and CDs that you can sort.  The Bank Deals blog is a good place to follow rate changes.\"",

With an emergency fund, I think the 'return of capital' is more important than the 'return on the capital', so I'm fine with putting it in a standard savings account in a local bank(not an internet account) even if it pays next to nothing. The beauty is that since the bank is local, you can walk in and withdraw it all during any weekday."

        "question": "Finance, Cash or Lease?",
        "answer": "When considering whether to finance, pay cash, or lease a car, the document I have provides some insights on each option. Here's a summary of what it suggests:\n\n- **Financing**: It is recommended to start with your bank or credit union when seeking financing as they may provide a better loan rate than the car dealer. Pre-approval for a loan can also give you leverage in negotiating the purchase price of the car because, in the eyes of the dealer, you are essentially a cash buyer, which could lead to a larger rebate or discount.\n\n- **Leasing**: Leasing is generally advised against because it is seen as a bad deal for the average consumer. When you lease, you are paying for the car's most expensive months of depreciation, and at the end of the lease, you have nothing to show for it\u2014no car ownership. Additionally, leases can come with various fees and penalties for maintenance failures or damage, which could add up to significant costs.\n\n- **Paying Cash**: Paying in cash may get you a rebate or a discount on the purchase price. By avoiding financing or leasing, you're not tied to monthly payments or interest. However, paying in cash means you'll be using a large amount of your liquid assets, which might not be optimal for everyone's financial situation.\n\nIn conclusion, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of each option based on your financial situation, the amount of time you plan to keep the car, and the flexibility you require. For many, avoiding the complexities and potential extra costs of leasing is beneficial, and financing might provide a more affordable path to car ownership when managed wisely. However, if you have the cash and prefer not to deal with loans or leases, paying outright is also a viable option .",

My outright opinion is to always buy a mildly used car as I hate the idea of loans and interest. With the amount of money that you currently possess, I believe the \"\"Buy-in-part\"\" option is best as it reduces your interest liability; but, I don't believe you should do it currently. 4,000 is a rather small cash fund for if something were to go boom in the night.   As for your question of interest: This is completely dependent on the amount you are able to pay per period and the total interest you are willing to spend, rows four and seven respectively. This is your money, and no one can tell you what's best to do with it than yourself. Keep looking for good leasing deals or if you think you can survive financial strife with 4,000 then follow your heart. \"\"Depreciation\"\" fluctuates to the buyer, so never assume what the car may lose in the next 2-3 years.

        "question": "Better to get loan from finance company or bank considering the drop of credit score?",
        "answer": "When considering taking out a loan from a finance company or a bank, one must weigh the potential impacts on credit score, the terms offered by each type of lender, and various other factors. According to the information provided in the document, there are several points to consider:\n\n1. **Credit Score Impact**: Generally, applying for a loan results in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which can cause a temporary decrease in your credit score, regardless of whether it's through a bank or a finance company. This effect is usually just a few points and recovers over a few months, but applying to multiple lenders at once can add up .\n\n2. **Diversity of Credit Types**: Adding an installment loan (like an auto loan) to your credit report when you don't have other installment loans can actually improve your credit diversification, which may be looked upon favorably by credit scoring models. However, the addition of a loan also changes other factors, such as your level of debt and the breadth of your accounts, which can influence your credit score in multiple ways .\n\n3. **Other Considerations**: When you are about to apply for a significant loan, such as a mortgage, the presence of an auto loan may impact your ability to qualify. Lenders look at both your potential mortgage payments (including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) and your other debt payments. The amount of these combined payments should fit within certain percentages of your monthly income to ensure affordability .\n\n4. **Mortgage Broker vs. Multiple Inquiries**: If your main concern is avoiding multiple hard inquiries on your credit report, which could drop your credit score, you might consider working with a mortgage broker instead of directly approaching multiple banks and finance companies. A mortgage broker can pull your credit once and shop for rates on your behalf, rather than having each lender perform their own hard inquiry .\n\nIt's essential to also compare the interest rates and terms offered by each institution, as these can vary greatly between banks and finance companies. Often finance companies may cater to people with lower credit scores, but they might charge higher interest rates in comparison to banks, which typically offer better rates to customers with higher credit scores.\n\nIn conclusion, it isn't simply whether one is better than the other, but which one aligns better with your financial situation, credit health, and long-term financial plans. Consider the terms offered by both, the impact on your credit score if you're planning on a major purchase like a home, and the consultation of a mortgage broker to minimize inquiries on your credit report.",

            "If your primary concern is a drop in your credit score, go to a mortgage broker instead of multiple banks and finance companies. Each time you ask a bank or financial institution for a loan, they do a hard pull on your credit rating which costs you a couple of points. Visit a dozen lenders and you'll lose 24 points. You will also be signalling to lenders that you're shopping for money. If you visit a mortgage broker he does a single hard pull on your credit score and offers your loan query to a dozen or more lenders, some of which you may not have even heard of. This costs you 2 points instead of 24. If you are only going to visit one financial institution or another specific one, the drop in credit score is the same couple of points. The above answer only applies if you make loan inquiries at multiple institutions."

        "question": "New car: buy with cash or 0% financing",
        "answer": "Choosing between buying a new car with cash or taking advantage of 0% financing can be influenced by various factors.\n\nWhen considering cash payments, merchants may offer discounts for cash purchases because they avoid interchange fees on cash transactions. This is especially true for smaller merchants or when buying from individuals. For large purchases like cars, dealers also earn substantial money from offering financing, meaning they might be less inclined to offer cash discounts. However, as interest rates are generally quite low, some buyers prefer paying in cash to avoid any financing costs\u2014even if the dealer offers a low-interest rate, the customer may feel that paying outright ultimately costs less .\n\nOn the other hand, taking the 0% financing route might seem appealing since you are not paying interest on the purchasing amount. However, it's important to pay close attention to the terms of such an offer. If you do not pay off your balance by the due date, you may lose the grace period and start incurring interest on your purchases from the day they are made .\n\nBear in mind that the decision also depends on personal financial strategies and preferences. Some people may prefer to have no debt and like the freedom of owning their car outright, while others may prefer to utilize the 0% financing option to keep cash on hand for other investments or emergencies .\n\nIn any case, when choosing between paying cash or opting for 0% financing, it's vital to consider the total costs, the value of keeping cash reserves, potential discounts, the terms of the financing deal, and your financial stability and risk tolerance. Always read the fine print and understand all the implications before you make a decision.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Some things you missed in your analysis:   How will financing change your insurance costs?  I.e. what is the difference between the insurance that you would buy for yourself and what they require?   Note that it is possible that your insurance preferences are more stringent than the financing company's.  If so, this isn't a big deal.  But what's important is to consider if that's true.  Because if you'd prefer to drive with only the legal minimum insurance and they insist that you have full coverage with no more than a $1000 deductible, that's a significant difference.   Remember that you don't have $22.5k for six years.  You have an average of $10.5k (($22.5k + -$1500)/2) for six years.  Because you make payments ($24k) throughout.  So you start with $22.5k and subtract $333.33 a month until you reach -$1500.  That neglects both investment gains and potential losses.   It's not the $333 payment that will freak out mortgage companies.  It's the $24k debt.  But that's offset by your $22.5k in assets at the beginning.  And the car of course counts as an asset, albeit at lower than its sale value.  I.e. from the bank's perspective, paying $22.5k for a car out of savings is almost as bad as borrowing $24k for a car.  Both reduce your net worth.   Watch out for hidden fees.  In particular, 0% interest can often change into higher interest under certain circumstances.   If we assume a 7% return for the six years, that's about $1400 the first year and less each year after.  Perhaps $4500 over six years.  But you aren't going to get a 7% return if you keep $24,000 in a bank account in case you have to pay off the loan.  Instead, you'll get more like 1%, less than inflation.  Even five year Certificates of Deposit are only about 2%, right around inflation (1.9% for previous twelve months).   You can't keep the $24,000 in a securities account and be sure that it will be there when you need it.  If the market crashes tomorrow, your $24,000 might be worth $12,000 instead.  You'd have to throw in extra money from elsewhere.  Instead of making $4500 at the cost of $1500, you'd have paid $25,500 for $12,000.  Not a good deal.  So for your plan to work, that $24,000 needs to be in an account that won't fall in value.   You either need to compromise on the idea of a separate account that is always there when you need it, or you have to accept rather low returns.   Personally, I would prefer not to have the debt and not to pay extra on the insurance.  But that's me.  The potential investment returns are not worth it to me.  If you give up the separate account, you can make a few thousand dollars more.  But your risk is higher.",

            "Cash price is $22,500. Financed, it's the same thing (0% interest) but you pay a $1500 fee. 1500/22500 = 6.6%. Basically the APR for your loan is 1.1% per year but you are paying it all upfront. Opportunity cost: If you take the $22,500 you plan to pay for the car and invested it, could you earn more than the $1500 interest on the car loan? According to google, as of today you can get 1 year CD @ 1.25% so yes. It's likely that interest rates will be going up in medium term so you can potentially earn even more.  Insurance cost: If you finance you'll have to get comprehensive insurance which could be costly. However, if you are planning to get it anyway (it's a brand new car after all), that's a wash. Which brings me to my main point: Why do you have $90k in a savings account? Even if you are planning to buy a house you should have that money invested in liquid assets earning you interest.  Conclusion: Take the cheap money while it's available. You never know when interest rates will go up again."

        "question": "Should I finance a car to build credit for a mortgage next year?",
        "answer": "Financing a car to build credit for a mortgage is a nuanced decision with both potential benefits and drawbacks. If you currently lack other installment loans on your credit report, adding an auto loan could help diversify your credit portfolio, which can be beneficial for your credit score. This diversification could potentially help you secure a better interest rate when applying for a mortgage. However, you should be cautious, as applying for a new car loan will result in a hard inquiry on your credit, which can lead to a short-term decrease in your score .\n\nMoreover, it is important to consider that the addition of a car loan means you will have another debt payment each month. When seeking a mortgage, lenders will look at your debt-to-income ratio as one of the deciding factors for approval. Specifically, they will evaluate the amount of your mortgage payment, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (collectively known as PITI), and compare this to your monthly income. The PITI should be no more than 28%-33% of your monthly income, and payments for other debts\u2014including car loans, school loans, credit cards\u2014should be no more than 10% .\n\nIf the car loan payments stay within this 10% window, the auto loan might not significantly influence the amount you could allocate to your monthly mortgage. Conversely, if the car loan takes a substantial portion of the 10% available for other debts, lenders may prefer to see a smaller amount of your income go towards PITI, potentially affecting your ability to borrow for a mortgage .\n\nTaking on new debt always carries risks, and the decision should be carefully weighed against your overall financial strategy, short-term and long-term goals, and current credit situation. It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to determine the best approach for your unique circumstances.",

            "The fluctuation of interest rates during the next year could easily dwarf the savings this attempt to improve your credit score will have; or the reverse is true. Will the loan improve your score enough to make a difference? It will not change the number of months old your oldest account is. It will increase the breadth of your accounts. Applying for the car loan will result in a short term decrease in the score because of the hard pull. The total impact will be harder to predict.  A few points either way will generally not have an impact on your rate. You will also notice the two cores in your question differ by more than 30 points. You can't control which number the lender will use. You also have to realize the number differs every day depending on when they pull it that month. The addition of a car loan, assuming you still have the loan when you buy the house, will not have a major impact on your ability to get afford the home mortgage. The bank cares about two numbers regarding monthly payments: the amount of your mortgage including principal, interest, taxes and insurance; and the amount of all other debt payments: car loan, school loans, credit cards. The PITI number should be no more than 28%-33% of your monthly income; the other payments no more than 10%.  If the auto loan payments fit in the 10% window, then the amount of money you can spend each month on the mortgage will not be impacted. If it is too large, then they will want to see a smaller amount of your income to go to PITI. If you buy the car, either by cash or by loan, after you apply for the mortgage they will be concerned because you are impacting directly numbers they are using to evaluate your financial health. I have experienced a delay because the buyer bought a car the week before closing. The biggest impact on your ability to get the loan is the greater than 20% down payment, Assuming you can still do that if you pay cash for the car.  Don't deplete your savings to get to the 50% down payment level. Keep money for closing costs, moving expenses, furnishing, plus other emergencies. Make it clear that you can easily cover the 20% level, and are willing to go higher to make the loan numbers work."

        "question": "How to finance necessary repairs to our home in order to sell it?",
        "answer": "In order to finance necessary repairs to your home before selling it, you might consider several options. One alternative funding source to consider is personal loans from family and friends, which can be a quicker way to secure the needed funds without the formalities of bank loans. If your network is unable to provide a personal loan, you could consider bringing in a partner or investors in exchange for capital, effectively selling a share in the property or business to raise the necessary funds .\n\nTraditional bank loans could be another route, although banks usually require two years' worth of tax returns from businesses to issue credit. For recently formed businesses or new homeowners, banks may review the personal tax returns and credit histories of the owners. Another aspect to prepare for is the necessity to provide collateral when securing a loan from a bank .\n\nAn option specific to businesses that might also be applied in your situation is factoring. Factoring allows a business to sell its accounts receivable (i.e., invoices) to a third party at a discount in exchange for immediate money with which to finance continued business. This is not a loan but the purchase of a financial asset, and hence does not depend on the firm's creditworthiness but instead on the value of the receivables. However, this can be a costly option and may not be directly applicable if you don't have business invoices or receivables to factor .\n\nRemember, alternative funding such as these methods could be necessary, and you might want to consult financial experts or advisors to explore the best options for your particular situation. If you're looking for broader guidance on managing finances and assets, consulting a financial advisor or attorney might be helpful to ensure you make an informed decision tailored to your financial situation.",

        "answer": "Dealing with a situation where dealer financing falls through can be stressful and may sometimes feel like a scam, but it's not always the case. There can be legitimate reasons why dealer financing doesn't get approved, such as:\n\n1. Errors in the credit application or credit report issues.\n2. Changes in the buyer's creditworthiness since the initial approval.\n3. The bank or lending institution could not verify the buyer's information.\n4. Miscommunication between the dealership and the lender.\n\nHowever, there can also be less scrupulous practices, such as:\n\n1. Yo-yo financing scams where the dealer lets you take the car home before the financing is fully approved, only to call you back later claiming the financing fell through and you need to sign a new, often more expensive loan.\n2. Changing the terms of the loan after you've taken the car home, such as higher interest rates or extending the loan term.\n\nIf you are concerned that you may be the victim of a scam or unethical practice, it's crucial to review any agreements or contracts you have signed. In particular, check whether there is a spot delivery agreement or a conditional sales contract which might allow the dealer to change the financing terms after you've taken possession of the vehicle.\n\nIf you'd like, I can review any documents you have related to the vehicle purchase and financing to provide more tailored advice.

        "question": "Close to retirement & we may move within 7 years. Should we re-finance our mortgage, or not?",
        "answer": "When considering whether to refinance your mortgage as you near retirement, there are several factors you need to consider:\n\n1. **Read the Terms Carefully**: Promotional offers such as a lower interest rate can be very attractive, but they often come with stringent conditions. If you fail to meet these conditions, which can include making a late payment or going over your limit, the promotion can be terminated, and you may be subject to a higher normal rate or a penalty rate.\n\n2. **Risk Tolerance**: As you approach retirement, your risk tolerance may change. Paying down debt can be seen as the risk-free asset in your portfolio, and there is value in reducing your exposure to volatility as you get closer to needing to withdraw from your savings for retirement.\n\n3. **Interest Rates**: Compare the interest rate of your current mortgage with the new rate you could secure through refinancing. If the new rate is significantly lower, it could mean substantial savings over the life of the loan.\n\n4. **Closing Costs**: Refinancing typically comes with closing costs that can include fees for the application, loan origination, appraisal, and more. These can add up to a substantial amount and should be weighed against the potential interest savings from refinancing.\n\n5. **Loan Term**: If you extend the term of your loan through refinancing (for example, taking out a new 30-year mortgage), you might have lower monthly payments, but you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan. If you can afford it, a shorter loan term (like 15 or 20 years) may save you money in the long run.\n\n6. **Time Horizon**: You mentioned a possible move within 7 years. If you plan to sell your home soon, you need to consider whether you will stay in the home long enough to break even on the costs of refinancing, given that it takes time to recoup the initial expenses of the new loan.\n\n7. **Your Retirement Plan**: Consider how refinancing fits within your broader retirement strategy. Would the cash flow saved from reduced mortgage payments help you better allocate resources in retirement, or is there more utility in paying off the debt more rapidly to decrease financial obligations in retirement?\n\n8. **Tax Implications**: Mortgage interest is typically tax-deductible. If you refinance and lower your interest payments, it might alter your tax situation. Consult with a tax professional to understand the implications.\n\nIt's important that you carefully analyze these factors in the context of your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. If you do decide to proceed with refinancing, ensure that it aligns with your long-term financial strategy, especially as you approach retirement.

            "That really depends on the lender, and in the current climate this is extremely unlikely. In the past it was possible to get a loan which is higher than the value of the house (deposit considered), usually on the basis that the buyer is going to improve the property (extend, renovate, etc.) and this increase the value of the property. Responsible lenders required some evidence of the plans to do this, but less responsible ones simply seem to have given the money. Here in the UK this was often based on the assumption that property value tends to rise relatively quickly anyway so a seemingly-reasonable addition to the loan on top of the current value of the property will quickly be covered. That meant that indeed some people have been able to get a loan which is higher than the cost of the purchase, even without concrete plans to actively increase the value of the property. Today the situation is quite different, lenders are a lot more careful and I can't see this happening. All that aside - had it been possible, is it a good idea?

        "question": "How to read bond yield quotes? What do the time, coupon, price, yield, and time mean?",
        "answer": "Bond yield quotes provide several important pieces of information for investors. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **Time**: The time of the quote represents the specific moment when the quote data is valid. Bond prices can fluctuate throughout the trading day.\n  \n- **Coupon**: The coupon, or coupon rate, is the amount of interest the bond will pay annually based on its face value. If a bond has a coupon rate of 5%, it means that it will pay $5 per year for every $100 of its face value.\n\n- **Price**: The price in a bond quote represents the cost to purchase a bond. It's typically normalized to a certain face value, usually $100. This price reflects what the market is willing to pay for the bond at the time of the quote.\n\n- **Yield**: The yield is the interest rate that is effectively received by the investor if the bond is purchased at the quoted price. It represents the return on investment for the bond, not taking into account any capital gains or losses caused by changes in the price of the bond itself.\n\n- **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**: This is inferred from the context, not mentioned directly in the quote you provided, but it's an important concept. Yield to maturity takes into account both the coupon payments and the capital gain or loss that would be realized if the bond is held to maturity. YTM is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until it matures.\n\nLet's take an example to illustrate how these work together in a bond quote. If we consider the \"4.25% Treasury Gilt 2019,\" the title of the bond includes a nominal yield of 4.25%, indicating that for every \u00a3100 nominal value, the treasury will pay \u00a34.25 annually. If the price is \u00a3116.27 and the bond's nominal value is \u00a3100, the yield is calculated as the annual payments of \u00a34.25 divided by the price of \u00a3116.27, resulting in an annual yield of 3.656%. As the bond approaches maturity, its market price will tend to move toward the nominal price, which can result in a loss if the bond was purchased above the nominal price. This loss, when combined with the interest received, gives you the gross redemption yield, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of the investment's performance .\n\nMoreover, the duration of a bond is a measure of the sensitivity of its price to changes in its yield, with various ways to define it, such as the modified duration, which indicates the percentage change in the bond price for a 1% increase in its yield .\n\nIf you have any specific questions about a bond quote you're looking at, feel free to provide the details, and I can help walk you through the interpretation of that quote.",

            "The 1 month and 1 year columns show the percentage change over that period. Coupon (coupon rate) is the amount of interest paid on the bond each period (as specified on the coupon itself.

Yield is the interest rate that you would receive by buying at that price (this is the inverse of the price). The time is the time of the quote presented.",
            "\"The first thing that it is important to note here is that the examples you have given are not individual bond prices.  This is what is called the \"\"generic\"\" bond price data, in effect a idealised bond with the indicated maturity period.  You can see individual bond prices on the UK Debt Management Office website. The meaning of the various attributes (price, yield, coupon) remains the same, but there may be no such bond to trade in the market.  So let's take the example of an actual UK Gilt, say the \"\"4.25% Treasury Gilt 2019\"\".  The UK Debt Management Office currently lists this bond as having a maturity date of 07-Mar-2019 and a price of GBP 116.27.  This means that you will pay 116.27 to purchase a bond with a nominal value of GBP 100.00.  Here, the \"\"nominal price\"\" is the price that HM Treasury will buy the bond back on the maturity date.   Note that the title of the bond indicates a \"\"nominal\"\" yield of 4.25%.  This is called the coupon, so here the coupon is 4.25%.  In other words, the treasury will pay GBP 4.25 annually for each bond with a nominal value of GBP 100.00.  Since you will now be paying a price of GBP 116.27 to purchase this bond in the market today, this means that you will be paying 116.27 to earn the nominal annual interest of 4.25.  This equates to a 3.656% yield, where 3.656% = 4.25/116.27.   It is very important to understand that the yield is not the whole story.  In particular, since the bond has a nominal value of GBP100, this means that as the maturity date approaches the market price of the bond will approach the nominal price of 100. In this case, this means that you will witness a loss of capital over the period that you hold the bond.  If you hold the bond until maturity, then you will lose GBP 16.27 for each nominal GBP100 bond you hold.  When this capital loss is netted off the interest recieved, you get what is called the gross redemption yield.  In this case, the gross redemption yield is given as approximately 0.75% per annum. NB.  The data table you have included clearly has errors in the pricing of the 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month generics.\""

The composition of a portfolio reflects your personal investment choices and can be divided further into different kinds of portfolios, such as a 401(k) portfolio, taxable portfolio, or real estate portfolio, depending on how investments are structured and purposed.\n\nA \"Fund,\" on the other hand, is a special type of portfolio that can be invested in by other people. It is essentially someone\u2019s portfolio which has been made available for others to invest in. Funds are managed by fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the investors in the fund, aligning with the specified investment strategy or objective of the fund, whether that be investing in technology companies, matching a stock index, or focusing on corporate bonds. By investing in a fund, individuals can benefit from the expertise of fund managers and achieve a well-diversified portfolio while incurring lower transaction costs since they are buying into one or few funds rather than building a diversified portfolio themselves.\n\nIn summary, a fund is a collective investment scheme managed by professionals whereas a personal portfolio is the collection of an individual's own investments .",

            "\"A \"\"Fund\"\" is generally speaking a collection of similar financial products, which are bundled into a single investment, so that you as an individual can buy a portion of the Fund rather than buying 50 portions of various products. e.g. a \"\"Bond Fund\"\" may be a collection of various corporate bonds that are bundled together. The performance of the Fund would be the aggregate of each individual item. Generally speaking Funds are like pre-packaged \"\"diversification\"\". Rather than take time (and fees) to buy 50 different stocks on the same stock index, you could buy an \"\"Index Fund\"\" which represents the values of all of those stocks. A \"\"Portfolio\"\" is your individual package of investments. ie: the 20k you have in bonds + the 5k you have in shares, + the 50k you have in \"\"Funds\"\" + the 100k rental property you own. You might split the definition further buy saying \"\"My 401(k) portfolio & my taxable portfolio & my real estate portfolio\"\"(etc.), to denote how those items are invested. The implication of \"\"Portfolio\"\" is that you have considered how all of your investments work together; ie: your 5k in stocks is not so risky, because it is only 5k out of your entire 185k portfolio, which includes some low risk bonds and funds. Another way of looking at it, is that a Fund is a special type of Portfolio. That is, a Fund is a portfolio, that someone will sell to someone else (see Daniel's answer below). For example: Imagine you had $5,000 invested in IBM shares, and also had $5,000 invested in Apple shares. Call this your portfolio. But you also want to sell your portfolio, so let's also call it a 'fund'. Then you sell half of your 'fund' to a friend. So your friend (let's call him Maurice) pays you $4,000, to invest in your 'Fund'. Maurice gives you $4k, and in return, you given him a note that says \"\"Maurice owns 40% of atp9's Fund\"\".  The following month, IBM pays you $100 in dividends. But, Maurice owns 40% of those dividends. So you give him a cheque for $40 (some funds automatically reinvest dividends for their clients instead of paying them out immediately). Then you sell your Apple shares for $6,000 (a gain of $1,000 since you bought them). But Maurice owns 40% of that 6k, so you give him $2,400 (or perhaps, instead of giving him the money immediately, you reinvest it within the fund, and buy $6k of Microsoft shares). Why would you set up this Fund? Because Maurice will pay you a fee equal to, let's say, 1% of his total investment. Your job is now to invest the money in the Fund, in a way that aligns with what you told Maurice when he signed the contract. ie: maybe it's a tech fund, and you can only invest in big Tech companies. Maybe it's an Index fund, and your investment needs to exactly match a specific portion of the New York Stock Exchange. Maybe it's a bond fund, and you can only invest in corporate bonds. So to reiterate, a portfolio is a collection of investments (think of an artist's portfolio, being a collection of their work). Usually, people refer to their own 'portfolio', of personal investments. A fund is someone's portfolio, that other people can invest in. This allows an individual investor to give some of their decision making over to a Fund manager. In addition to relying on expertise of others, this allows the investor to save on transaction costs, because they can have a well-diversified portfolio (see what I did there?) while only buying into one or a few funds.\"",
            "\"A fund is a portfolio, in that it is a collection, so the term is interchangeable for the most part.  Funds are made up of a combination of equities positions (i.e., stocks, bonds, etc.) plus some amount of un-invested cash. Most of the time, when people are talking about a \"\"fund\"\", they are describing what is really an investment strategy.  In other words, an example would be a \"\"Far East Agressive\"\" fund (just a made up name for illustration here), which focuses on investment opportunities in the Far East that have a higher level of risk than most other investments, thus they provide better returns for the investors.  The \"\"portfolio\"\" part of that is what the stocks are that the fund has purchased and is holding on behalf of its investors.  Other funds focus on municipal bonds or government bonds, and the list goes on. I hope this helps. Good luck!\"",
            "\"Oddly enough, in the USA, there are enough cost and tax savings between buy-and-hold of a static portfolio and buying into a fund that a few brokerages have sprung up around the concept, such as FolioFN, to make it easier for small investors to manage numerous small holdings via fractional shares and no commission window trades. A static buy-and-hold portfolio of stocks can be had for a few dollars per trade.  Buying into a fund involves various annual and one time fees that are quoted as percentages of the investment.  Even 1-2% can be a lot, especially if it is every year.  Typically, a US mutual fund must send out a 1099 tax form to each investor, stating that investors share of the dividends and capital gains for each year. The true impact of this is not obvious until you get a tax bill for gains that you did not enjoy, which can happen when you buy into a fund late in the year that has realized capital gains.  What fund investors sometimes fail to appreciate is that they are taxed both on their own holding period of fund shares and the fund's capital gains distributions determined by the fund's holding period of its investments. For example, if ABC tech fund bought Google stock several years ago for $100/share, and sold it for $500/share in the same year you bought into the ABC fund, then you will receive a \"\"capital gains distribution\"\" on your 1099 that will include some dollar amount, which is considered your share of that long-term profit for tax purposes. The amount is not customized for your holding period, capital gains are distributed pro-rata among all current fund shareholders as of the ex-distribution date. Morningstar tracks this as Potential Capital Gains Exposure and so there is a way to check this possibility before investing. Funds who have unsold losers in their portfolio are also affected by these same rules, have been called \"\"free rides\"\" because those funds, if they find some winners, will have losers that they can sell simultaneously with the winners to remain tax neutral.  See \"\"On the Lookout for Tax Traps and Free Riders\"\", Morningstar, pdf In contrast, buying-and-holding a portfolio does not attract any capital gains taxes until the stocks in the portfolio are sold at a profit.  A fund often is actively managed.  That is, experts will alter the portfolio from time to time or advise the fund to buy or sell particular investments. Note however, that even the experts are required to tell you that \"\"past performance is no guarantee of future results.\"\"\""

        "question": "How to calculate new price for bond if yield increases",
        "answer": "To calculate the new price of a bond when the yield increases, you can follow one of these approaches:\n\n1. Direct calculation method:\n   If the yield goes up, say from 4.69% to 4.87%, you can calculate the new price by first determining how much 4.87% of the new price should be to equal the fixed annual payment. For instance, if the annual payment is \u00a347.60, you can find the new price by dividing the annual payment by the new yield percentage:\n   `New Price = \u00a347.60 / 4.87% = \u00a3977.48`\n   \n   Another way to consider it is to recognize that the yield has increased by a factor of the new yield over the old yield (4.87% / 4.69% = 1.0384), and therefore, the price must decrease by this factor. If the original price was \u00a31015, then:\n   `New Price = \u00a31015 / 1.0384 = \u00a3977.48` .\n\n2. Duration method:\n   Using the bond's duration to estimate the sensitivity of its price to changes in the yield, you can calculate the change in price as follows:\n   `Change in Price = -Price x Duration x Change in Yield (as %)`\n   \n   If you have a duration of 5 and the bond's initial price is \u00a31015, with a yield change from 4.69% to 4.87% (or a 0.18% absolute increase), the calculation would be:\n   `Change in Price = -\u00a31015 x 5% x (4.87% - 4.69%) = -\u00a39.135`\n   \n   To find the new price, subtract this change from the original price:\n   `New Price = \u00a31015 - \u00a39.135 = \u00a31005.865` .\n\nThese methods assume that all other factors remain constant and that the bond\u2019s payments (coupons) are fixed. The approach you choose may depend on the information available and the specifics of the bond in question. Duration method relies on the assumption of a linear relationship between price and yield changes and is more accurate for small changes in yield. The direct calculation method, on the other hand, may be more straightforward to apply for any given yield change but may not account for the bond's duration or convexity.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "I am currently trying out some variations (moving terms around ...) of the formula for the present value of money The relationship between yield and price is much simpler than that. If you pay \u00a31015 for a bond and its current yield is 4.69%, that means you will receive in income each year: 4.69% * \u00a31015 = \u00a347.60 The income from the bond is defined by its coupon rate and its face value, not the market value. So that bond will continue to pay \u00a347.60 each year, regardless of the market price. The market price will go up or down according to the market as a whole, and the credit rating of the issuer.  If the issuer is likely to default, the market price goes down and the yield goes up. If similar companies start offering bonds with higher yields, the market price goes down to make the bond competitive in the market, again raising yield. So if the yield goes up to 4.87%, what is the price such that 4.87% of that price is \u00a347.60? \u00a347.60 / 4.87% = \u00a3977.48 Another way to think of it: if the yield goes up from 4.69% to 4.87%, then yield has increased by a factor of: 4.87% / 4.69% = 1.0384 Consequently, market price must decrease by the same factor: \u00a31015 / 1.0384 = \u00a3977.48",
            "The duration of a bond tells you the sensitivity of its price to its yield. There are various ways of defining it (see here for example), and it would have been preferable to have a more precise statement of the type of duration we should assume in answering this question. However, my best guess (given that the duration is stated without units) is that this is a modified duration. This is defined as the percentage decrease in the bond price for a 1% increase in the yield. So, change in price = -price x duration (as %) x change in yield (in %) For your duration of 5, this means that the bond price decreases by a relative 5% for every 1% absolute increase in its yield. Using the actual yield change in your question, 0.18%, we find: change in price = -1015 x 5% x (4.87 - 4.69) = -9.135 So the new price will be 1015 - 9.135 = \u00a31005.865",
            "Edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of @Atkins Assuming, (apparently incorrectly) that duration is time to maturity: First, note that the question does not mention the coupon rate, the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year.  So let's calculate that. Consider the cash flow described.  You pay out 1015 at the start of Year #1, to buy the bond.  At the end of Years #1 to #5, you receive a coupon payment of X.  Also at the end of Year #5, you receive the face value of the bond, 1000.  And you are told that the pay out equals the money received, using a time value of money of 4.69% So, if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date, we have the equation: Maturity + Future Value of coupons = Future value of Bond Purchase price 1000 + X *( (1 + .0469)^5-1)/0.0469 = 1015 * 1.0469^5 Solving this for X, we obtain 50.33;  the coupon rate is 5.033%.  You will receive 50.33 at the end of each of the five years.   Now, we can take this fixed schedule of payments, and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above;  only now, the unknown is the price paid for the bond, Y. 1000 + 50.33 * ((1 + 0.0487)^5 - 1) / .0487 = Y * 1.0487^5 Solving this equation for Y, we obtain: Y = 1007.08"

        "question": "Does financing a portfolio on margin affect the variance of a portfolio?",
        "answer": "Yes, financing a portfolio on margin does affect the variance of a portfolio. The use of leverage increases the variance of your individual portfolio, which is to say, the fluctuation in the value of your personal net worth due to changes in asset prices is magnified. The rationale behind this is that if you are using borrowed funds to finance a larger position in risky assets, the absolute return (up or down) on your portfolio will be larger compared to if you had not used borrowed funds. As such, both the expected returns and the risk, if risk is defined as variance, will increase .\n\nFor example, if you have 50% equity and 50% debt in your assets, not only can your potential gains be magnified, but your losses can also exceed the value of your equity. This is in contrast to a portfolio financed purely by equity, where your losses are capped at the total equity value. Financing a portfolio with debt leads to higher variance because it effectively allows for greater exposure to market movements relative to the equity investment .\n\nThe variance of a portfolio, mathematically, is influenced by the weights of the different assets within it, and borrowing can be seen as introducing a negative weight for the borrowed funds. Since the variance of the borrowed funds can be considered zero (assuming fixed borrowing rates), this effectively increases the weights of the other, riskier assets in your portfolio, thereby increasing the overall portfolio variance .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Yes, more leverage increases the variance of your individual portfolio (variance of your personal net worth). The simple way to think about it is that if you only own only 50% of your risky assets, then you can own twice as many risky assets. That means they will move around twice as much (in absolute terms). Expected returns and risk (if risk is variance) both go up. If you lend rather than borrow, then you might have only half your net worth in risky assets, and then your expected returns and variation in returns will go down. Note, the practice of using leverage differs from portfolio theory in a couple important ways.",
            "\"Financing a portfolio with debt (on margin) leads to higher variance. That's the WHOLE POINT. Let's say it's 50-50.  On the downside, with 100% equity, you can never lose more than your whole equity. But if you have assets of 100, of which 50% is equity and 50% is debt, your losses can be greater than 50%, which is to say more than the value of your equity. The reverse is true. You can make money at TWICE the rate if the market goes up. But \"\"you pay your money and you take your chances\"\" (Punch, 1846).\"",
            "Variance of a single asset is defined as follows: \u03c32 = \u03a3i(Xi - \u03bc)2 where Xi's represent all the possible final market values of your asset and \u03bc represents the mean of all such market values.  The portfolio's variance is defined as \u03c3p2 = \u03a3iwi2\u03c3i2 where, \u03c3p is the portfolio's variance, and wi stands for the weight of the ith asset.  Now, if you include the borrowing in your portfolio, that would classify as technically shorting at the borrowing rate. Thus, this weight would (by the virtue of being negative) increase all other weights. Moreover, the variance of this is likely to be zero (assuming fixed borrowing rates). Thus, weights of risky assets rise and the investor's portfolio's variance will go up. Also see, CML at wikipedia."

        "answer": "To calculate the value of a bond that is priced to yield 'X%', you can follow this formula:\n\nThe bond price is the present value of its expected future cash flows which consist of the present value of its periodic coupon payments and the present value of its principal amount (face value) to be received at maturity. Assuming an annual coupon bond, the formula would look something like this:\n\n\\[ Price = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{C}{(1+Y)^i} + \\frac{M}{(1+Y)^n} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( C \\) is the annual coupon payment,\n- \\( Y \\) is the yield to maturity (expressed as a decimal),\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years until maturity,\n- \\( M \\) is the face value of the bond.\n\nIn the context of your uploaded document, there are examples demonstrating how the market price of a bond and its yield are inversely related. For instance, if you have a bond that pays a fixed coupon of \u00a347.60 annually and its yield increases from 4.69% to 4.87%, then the price at which this bond would need to be sold in the market to yield 4.87% is calculated as \u00a347.60 divided by 4.87%, resulting in a new price of \u00a3977.48 .\n\nFurthermore, the document mentions modified duration, which represents the percentage decrease in the bond's price for a 1% increase in yield. This can be used to estimate the new price of a bond given a small change in yield. For example, if a bond originally priced at \u00a31015 has a modified duration of 5, the price change for a yield increase from 4.69% to 4.87% can be calculated, resulting in a new price of \u00a31005.865 .\n\nAdditionally, if the coupon rate isn't mentioned, it can be calculated based on the present value of the bond's cash flows equaling the purchase price, such as in examples where the formula incorporates the bond's time value of money .\n\nFor an exact calculation tailored to a specific bond investment, you would need to know the bond's coupon rate, the number of periods until maturity, and the desired yield to maturity. You can then apply the specified yield rate to the present value formula to find out what price the bond should be purchased at to achieve that yield.",

This results in an immediate positive cash flow of $7.62. In one year, the bond lender can be repaid with the $1000 from the bank . This strategy is akin to shorting a bond, where someone borrows a bond and sells it with the intent to replace the security and any dividends or coupons at the end.\n\nThe process calculates the present value of future cash flows, such as coupons, and finally the bond\u2019s repayment at maturity, to determine the profitability of the investment when considering the interest rate over time. This requires understanding the actual cash flows that the bond would generate, drawing a time-line diagram for clarity, and using the interest rate to discount each payment to its present value . \n\nFor more detailed cash flow calculations, one might need to apply formulas like the Present Value of an Annuity to handle more complex bond structures, such as a 20 year quarterly bond. In such cases, using the formula can speed up the process of calculating the net present value of all coupon payments in one step . \n\nIf you need further clarification on the topic or have more specific questions regarding net cash flows, please let me know!",

            "Investopedia has a good explanation of the term shorting which is what this is. In the simplest of terms, someone is borrowing the bond and selling it with the intent to replace the security and any dividends or coupons in the end. The idea is that if a bond is overvalued, one may be able to buy it back later for a cheaper price and pocket the difference. There are various rules about this including margin requirements to maintain since there is the risk of the security going up in price enough that someone may be forced into a buy to cover in the form of a margin call. If one can sell the bond at $960 now and then buy it back later for $952.38 then one could pocket the difference. Part of what you aren't seeing is what are other bonds doing in terms of their prices over time here. The key point here is that brokers may lend out securities and accrue interest on loaned securities for another point here."

        "question": "Reasons behind a large price movement of a penny stock without any recent news releases?",
        "answer": "There are multiple reasons why a penny stock might experience a large price movement without any recent news releases:\n\n1. **Short Selling:** Short selling doesn't inherently lower the stock price more than other kinds of selling. However, high short interest can lead to a price increase if a rally occurs because a short squeeze can result in a larger rally as short sellers rush to cover their positions .\n\n2. **Margin Buying:** Similar to short selling, buying stocks on margin can lead to significant price movements if the value of the stock decreases rapidly, forcing margin buyers to sell and causing a cascade effect in the opposite direction .\n\n3. **Volatility and Low Price:** Penny stocks are characterized by high volatility, meaning that small changes in stock prices can translate into large percentage changes. This volatility is further amplified at low stock prices, where a minor absolute change in price can represent a significant percentage change .\n\n4. **Pump and Dump Schemes:** A stock may be subject to manipulation through \"pump and dump\" schemes where the price is artificially inflated and then the stock is sold off by the manipulators at the higher price. This type of manipulation is more feasible with penny stocks which typically have low trading volumes, allowing even small trades to significantly alter the stock price .\n\n5. **Trading Volume:** Penny stocks tend to have low trading volumes, which means it is easier for a relatively small trade to have a large impact on the stock price .\n\n6. **Stock Splits:** A stock split can force short sellers of penny stocks to cover their shorts, which can lead to an appreciation in price. However, this usually happens in conjunction with some sort of announcement from the company, so it's not usually a \"without news\" scenario .\n\nIt's important to note that these are general factors that can influence penny stock prices and each stock may have unique factors at play. Additionally, since penny stocks are often less regulated and have fewer requirements for financial transparency, they are more susceptible to rumors and speculation which may not always stem from official news releases. Investors must exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before trading penny stocks.",

            "\"There are several reasons to pay for data instead of using Yahoo Finance, although these reasons don't necessarily apply to you if you're only planning to use the data for personal use.  Yahoo will throttle you if you attempt to download too much data in a short time period. You can opt to use the Yahoo Query Language (YQL), which does provide another interface to their financial data apart from simply downloading the CSV files. Although the rate limit is higher for YQL, you may still run into it. An API that a paid data provider exposes will likely have higher thresholds.  Although the reliability varies throughout the site, Yahoo Finance isn't considered the most reliable of sources. You can't beat free, of course, but at least for research purposes, the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at UChicago and Wharton is considered the gold standard. On the commercial side, data providers like eSignal, Bloomberg, Reuters also enjoy widespread popularity. Although both the output from YQL and Yahoo's current CSV output are fairly standard, they won't necessarily remain that way. A commercial API is basically a contract with the data provider that they won't change the format without significant prior notice, but it's reasonable to assume that if Yahoo wanted to, they could make minor changes to the format and break many commercial applications. A change in Yahoo's format would likely break many sites or applications too, but their terms of use do state that Yahoo \"\"may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Yahoo!

According to Yahoo Finance's license terms, you can't use the data in a commercial application unless you specifically use their \"\"badges\"\" (whatever those are). See here. In this post, a Yahoo employee states: The Finance TOS is fairly specific. Redistribution of data is only   allowed if you are using the badges the team has created. Otherwise, you can use YQL or whatever method to obtain data for   personal use. The license itself states that you may not: sell, lease, or sublicense the Yahoo!

Finance Modules, whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or   otherwise, without Yahoo!'s prior, express, written permission In short, for personal use, Yahoo Finance is more than adequate. For research or commercial purposes, a data provider is a better option. Furthermore, many commercial applications require more data than Yahoo provides, e.g. tick-by-tick data for equities, derivatives, futures, data on mergers, etc., which a paid data source will likely provide. Yahoo is also known for inaccuracies in its financial statements; I can't find any examples at the moment, but I had a professor who enjoyed pointing out flaws in the 10K's that he had come across. I've always assumed this is because the data were manually entered, although I would assume EDGAR has some method for automatic retrieval.

        "question": "Why are we taxed on revenue and companies on profit?",
        "answer": "The distinction between taxing individuals on revenue (income) and companies on profit can be understood by considering the various categories of income and the purposes of tax policy. \n\nIndividuals are typically taxed on income, which can include wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, and other forms of compensation. This is known as \"earned income\" and is subject to payroll taxes and income taxes, with the latter being progressively higher depending on the amount earned after taking into account tax credits, exemptions, and deductions .\n\nCorporations, on the other hand, are taxed on their profits, which is what remains after they subtract their costs from their revenues. The rationale for taxing corporations on profits rather than revenue is that it allows for the cost of doing business to be recognized before determining the amount that should be taxed. Additionally, long-term capital gains like those from assets held for more than a year by individuals are generally taxed at lower rates, or in some cases not taxed at all for lower income brackets, to encourage longer-term investment and to account for the fact that corporations have already been taxed on their earnings .\n\nThe treatment of long-term capital gains in this manner is justified by the desire to motivate people to make long-term investments rather than seeking short-term profit. Moreover, lower tax rates for long-term capital gains are justified by recognizing that many of these assets are already taxed as they appreciate (such as real-estate being taxed through local property taxes and corporate earnings being taxed at the corporate tax rate) .\n\nIt is also argued that capital gains reflect earnings that have already been taxed at the corporate level, and taxing them again as ordinary income would amount to a double taxation .\n\nTherefore, the different tax treatments for individuals and corporations stem from policy decisions that prioritize the incentivization of certain types of economic activities, such as long-term investment over consumption, and seek to tax entities based on their actual capacity to pay, which is better represented by profit in the case of corporations, rather than a revenue basis which does not take into account the costs associated with generating that revenue.",

Companies have much more detailed systems in place to track and categorize expenses, so it's easier to just tax on net profit.

Utilizing stop orders for entering and exiting the market based on your analysis and chosen price levels, without being swayed by emotions during market hours.\n\n2. It's important to do your analysis and set your orders when the market is closed, to avoid emotional decisions.\n\n3.

It is difficult to find a pattern that holds true in different data pulled from the same population.  Using similar logic, don't look for a pattern in the data from the entire population. If you do, you won't have anything to test it against. If you don't have anything to test it against, it is difficult to tell the difference between a pattern that has a cause (and will likely continue) and a pattern that comes from random noise (which has no reason to continue). If you lose money in bad years, that's okay. Just make sure that the gains in good years are collectively greater than the losses in bad years. If you put $10 in and lose 50%, you then need a 100% gain just to get back up to $10.  A Black Swan event (popularized by Nassim Taleb, if memory serves) is something that is unpredictable but will almost certainly happen at some point. For example, a significant natural disaster will almost certainly impact the United States (or any other large country) in the next year or two. However, at the moment we have very little idea what that disaster will be or where it will hit.  By the same token, there will be Black Swan events in the financial market.

        "question": "What fiscal scrutiny can be expected from IRS in early retirement?",
        "answer": "The documents suggest that the IRS has a history of closely scrutinizing the earnings and classification of income for those who operate under an S-Corp, particularly if it appears that the business owner is attempting to lower tax liability by mischaracterizing wages as distributions. If you're an early retiree running an S-Corp, and especially if you're the sole employee, you're expected to pay a reasonable salary for the work you do. Any profit in excess of that could be taken as a distribution.\n\nFor instance, in the case of Watson v Commissioner, the IRS conducted a study comparing Watson\u2019s salary to peers in similar roles and determined it was too low, leading to a re-characterization of some distributions into salary to reflect what was deemed to be a reasonable amount. This establishes a precedent for what the IRS might look at when determining whether or not an individual is paying a reasonable salary through an S-Corp .\n\nAdditionally, the IRS is known to be particularly vigilant for signs of tax evasion, such as declaring all net income from an S-Corp as profits instead of subject to Self-Employment (SE) tax which would be more appropriate if the earnings come from personal services. Such a tax evasion scheme is likely to draw IRS scrutiny .\n\nTherefore, in early retirement, if you're receiving income through an S-Corp or similar business structure, it's essential to make sure that all salary and distribution classifications are defensible. Consulting with an accountant or attorney to get professional advice is highly recommended to ensure compliance with current IRS rules and to be prepared in case of an audit .",

It's advisable to have a month's expenses available for emergencies, which would be around $1500 based on the example given. This could be saved at a pace of $100 a month, however, each individual should consider their own potential emergency expenses and adjust accordingly. The suggestion is also made that if saving is particularly difficult, one could consider using a credit card with a limit of around $2000 as an emergency fund.\n\nThe goal would be to avoid delaying graduation due to financial strain and to be mentally sharp, as the economic impact of delayed graduation can be significant. Therefore, it's crucial to balance between saving for emergencies and keeping a sustainable lifestyle that does not compromise one's health and academic performance .\n\nPlease remember that these are general suggestions, and the specific amount to save may differ based on personal circumstances, cost of living in the area, income, and other financial obligations.

For you, that would be $1500. If you put $100 a month aside, it will take over a year to have your emergency fund. It's easy to argue that you should pick a higher pace, so as to have your emergency money in place sooner. However, the \"\"emergencies\"\" usually cited are things like home repair, car repair, needing to replace your car, and so on. Since you are renting your home and don't have a car, these emergencies aren't going to happen to you. Ask yourself, if your home was destroyed, and you had to replace all your clothes and possessions (including furniture), how much would you need? (Keep in mind any insurance you have.) The only emergency expense I can't guess about is health costs, because I live in Canada. I would be tempted to tell you to get a credit card with a $2000 limit and consider that your emergency fund, just because grad student living is so tight to the bone (been there, and 25 years ago I had $1200 a month, so it must be harder for you now.) If you do manage to save up $1500, and you've really been pinching to do that (walking instead of taking the bus, staying on campus hungry instead of popping out to buy food) let up on yourself when you hit the target. Delaying your graduation by a few months because you're not mentally sharp due to hunger or tiredness will be a far bigger economic hit than not having saved $200 a month for 2 or 3 years.

        "answer": "If you're dealing with money from an expiring UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) account, there are some general guidelines that might be considered best practices to follow:\n\n1. Putting the money into a savings account can be a starting point. This is a safe option that allows you to store the funds while you figure out a longer-term plan for the money. It's not about earning a significant return immediately but about securing the money safely .\n\n2. Consider high-yield savings accounts for better earning potential. Accounts from institutions like EverBank or Personal Savings from Amex are examples where you can expect to earn some interest on the stored money, although the primary goal would still be security and liquidity .\n\n3. When planning what to do with the money, think about what the person who set up the UTMA account might have wanted. Typically, a diversified strategy that involves some combination of investing, giving, and spending can be a balanced approach to honoring their memory and managing the funds responsibly .\n\n4. For investments, contacting reputable companies like Fidelity or Vanguard is advisable. They can guide you in selecting mutual funds appropriate for your needs and risk tolerance.

        "question": "What is vested stock and yearly dividends?",
        "answer": "Vested stock refers to company shares that an employee is entitled to after fulfilling certain conditions - typically, after staying employed with the company for a specific period. When the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied, that option is said to have vested, which simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares .\n\nYearly dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders, usually derived from the company's profits. Dividends are typically distributed periodically (often annually, but they can also be more or less frequent or irregular), and the amount of money each shareholder receives is based on the number of shares they own. For instance, if the company declares a dividend of 10 cents per share and an individual owns 200,000 shares, they would receive $20,000 in dividends .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Vesting As you may know a stock option is the right to acquire a given amount of stock at a given price.  Actually acquiring the stock is referred to as exercising the option.  Your company is offering you options over 200,000 shares but not all of those options can be exercised immediately. Initially you will only be able to acquire 25,000 shares; the other 175,000 have conditions attached, the condition in this case presumably being that you are still employed by the company at the specified time in the future.  When the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied that option is said to have vested - this simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares. Dividends Arguably the primary purpose of most private companies is to make money for their owners (i.e. the shareholders) by selling goods and/or services at a profit.  How does that money actually get to the shareholders?  There are a few possible ways of which paying a dividend is one.  Periodically (potentially annually but possibly more or less frequently or irregularly) the management of a company may look at how it is doing and decide that it can afford to pay so many cents per share as a dividend.  Every shareholder would then receive that number of cents multiplied by the number of shares held. So for example in 4 years or so, after all your stock options have vested and assuming you have exercised them you will own 200,000 shares in your company.  If the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share you would receive $20,000.  Depending on where you are and your exact circumstances you may or may not have to pay tax on this. Those are the basic concepts - as you might expect there are all kinds of variations and complications that can occur, but that's hopefully enough to get you started."

Therefore, the company entered into administration and was being managed by a regulated Australian authority.\n\nThe job of the administrator was to find suitable buyers so that most of the creditors could be paid off and to arrive at a suitable deal. In the case of Network Ten, the liabilities were so large that no one was interested in buying the company. CBS's deal meant that existing shareholders would not receive any payment as the value of the company was negative. Consequently, even the current creditors might not have been paid in full and may have had to accept a pro-rated amount, possibly incurring losses .",

In case of TEN; the company has more liabilities; even after all assets are sold off; there is not enough money left out to pay all the creditors. Hence the company is in Administration. i.e. it is now being managed by Regulated Australian authority. The job of the administrator is to find out suitable buyers so that most of the creditors are paid off and if there is surplus pay off the shareholder or arrive at a suitable deal. In case of TEN; the liabilities are so large that no one is ready to buy the company and the deal of CBS will also mean nothing gets paid to existing shareholders as the value is negative [as the company is separate legal entity, they can't recover the negative from shareholders].

        "answer": "Refusing the $4,000/year insurance for only 10 years and preferring $500/year indefinitely can be financially advantageous due to the difference in total costs and the opportunity cost associated with the saved amount. If you were to take the $4,000/year option, you would spend a total of $40,000 over 10 years. On the other hand, paying $500/year would take 80 years to reach the same $40,000 outlay.\n\nAfter the first 10 years, with the $500/year option, you will have paid only $5,000, leaving you with $35,000 ($40,000 - $5,000) more in your pocket compared to the $4,000/year option. This $35,000 can be invested at a modest return rate of 1.43% annually to generate enough income to cover the $500 payments indefinitely without diminishing the principal. Moreover, if you manage to secure an investment with a higher return rate, you could increase your savings even further over the long term.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The breakeven amount isn't at 8 years. You calculated how many years of paying $500 it would take to break even with one year of paying $4000. 8 x 10 years = 80 years. So by paying $500/year it will take you 80 years to have spent the same amount ($40000 total) as you did in 10 years. At this point it may seem obvious what the better choice is. Consider where you'll be after 10 years: In scenario #1 you've spent $5000 ($500*10) and have to continue spending $500/year indefinitely. In scenario #2 you've spent $40000 ($4000*10) and don't have to pay any more, but you currently have $35000 ($40000 - $5000) less than you did in scenario #1. If you had stayed with scenario #1 you could invest that $35000 at a measly 1.43% annual return and cover the $500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining $35000.

        "question": "does interest payment on loan stay the same if I pay early",
        "answer": "The interest payment on a loan can be affected if you pay early. Interest typically accrues daily based on the amount you owe, so the less you owe, the less the daily interest accrual. Thus, if you pay off part of your loan early, it could result in reduced overall interest payments because the principal amount owing would be reduced, and the interest would be calculated on this lower amount for the remaining term of the loan.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The typical case would be - as you expected - that the interest goes down equally dramatically, and you would pay much less interest. Note that that does not remove your obligation to pay the full 1000 every month - even though you could argue that you are 90 months ahead in paying, you still need to deliver 1000 a month, until it is fully paid. Some mortgages are made differently - they do not allow that. Basically, if you pay a large amount at once, it is considered a 'pre-payment' for the next x month. As a result, you are now x months ahead (and could stop paying for that much time), but your interest stays high. The latter type 'protects' the bank against 'losing' the interest income they already planned for. As a balance, those type of mortgages are typically slightly cheaper (because the bank is in a better position). You did not specify a country; in Germany, typically all mortgages are of the second type; but - you can get 1.35% mortgages... In the US, most are the first.  You need to check which type you have, best before you pay a large amount. In the latter case, it is better to invest that money and use it to pay off as soon as you reach the threshold; in the first case, any extra payoff is to your advantage.",
            "It depends on the type of loan.  Fully amortized loans have a schedule of payments don't recalculate as you pay.  If you want to make an additional payment you need to contact the lender to apply your payment toward principle and reamortize the loan.  Otherwise all your additional payment will do is change the amount due on your next payment, or push out your next payment due date. Regarding interest calculation, you owe interest on the principle outstanding.  Say you have a 10 year loan (120 Months), at 5% APR, and a $1,000 payment (this means you borrowed roughly $94,000) Each month the amount of interest owed reduces because there is less principle outstanding.  The reason loans are amortized like this is so the borrower has a predictable, known, monthly amount due."

        "question": "Formula that predicts whether one is better off investing or paying down debt",
        "answer": "Based on the information retrieved from the document, there are several perspectives regarding whether it is better to invest or pay down debt. The decision ultimately comes down to an individual's personal risk tolerance and financial situation. Here are a few points to consider from the text:\n\n1. Paying down debt is described as low-risk with a guaranteed return equivalent to the interest rate of the debt. For example, paying off a loan with a 4% interest rate means you are effectively earning a 4% return as you no longer have to pay that interest .\n\n2. Investing, on the other hand, especially in stock mutual funds, can be high-risk, high-reward. The potential for returns may be greater, but it comes with the risk of losing your investment .\n\n3. Some discuss the emotional and psychological benefits of being debt-free, suggesting owning a home outright alleviates a big burden and may provide more freedom to pursue new opportunities .\n\n4. It's mentioned that liquidity should be considered as well. Paying off debt reduces liquidity, whereas investing leaves the funds available if needed for emergencies or opportunities .\n\n5. Another factor is the potential employer matching contributions to retirement accounts (like a 401(k)), which could offer a higher immediate return than either paying off debt or other types of investments .\n\n6. Tax considerations, like the deductibility of student loan interest, could also influence the decision to invest versus pay down certain types of debt .\n\n7. There are also different approaches and advice such as one suggesting that individuals switch to a 15-year mortgage to pay off their home faster, which could lower the interest rate and provide a solid base for future investments .\n\nEach of these points highlights different factors that need to be considered, such as the interest rates of debts, the potential returns on investments, personal risk tolerance, liquidity needs, tax implications, employer match programs, and individual life circumstances. It\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all answer, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to better understand the nuances of your specific situation.",

            "you should always invest if your investment rate of return is higher   than your interest rate Your next line, about standard deviation is dead on.  There are too many variables to give an exact answer here, in my opinion. The main reason is that one variable isn't easy to quantify - One's risk tolerance.  Clearly, there's one extreme, the 18% credit card. Unless you are funding loanshark type rates of 2%/week, it's safe to say that 18% debt should take priority over any investments, except for the matched 401(k) deposits.  What I think you're talking about is something we've addressed here in multiple threads.  Do I prepay my sub 4% mortgage or invest? In this case, (and to Noah's comment) the question is whether you can expect a post-tax return of over 3% during your time horizon. I look at the return for 15 years from 1998-2013 and see a 6% CAGR for the S&P. I chose 15 years, as the choice is often one of paying a 30 year mortgage faster, as fast as 15. The last 15 years offer a pretty bad scenario, 2 crashes and a mortgage crisis. 6% after long term gains would get you 5.1% net.  You can pull the data back to 1871 and run CAGR numbers for the timeframe of your choosing. I haven't done it yet, but I imagine there's no 15 year span that lags the 3% target I cite.  What makes it more complex is that the investment isn't lump sum. It may not be obvious, but CAGR is a dollar invested at T=0, and returns calculated to T=final year. It would take a bit of spreadsheeting to invest the extra funds every month/year over your period of analysis.  In the end, there are still those who will choose to pay off their 4% mortgage regardless of what the numbers show. Even if the 15 year result showed worst case 3.5% (almost no profit) and an average 10%, the feeling of risk is more than many will want.",
            "Although I don't think you need to factor in risk tolerance to get the probabilities, I agree with JoeTaxpayer that you will need to factor in risk tolerance in order to make a practical decision about what to do.  In fact, I think that to make a practical decision you will need more than the specific probability you ask for you in the question; rather, you would like to see the complete probability distribution of possible outcomes. In other words, it's not enough to know that there is a 51% chance that investing will outperform paying down debt.  You actually need to know much it outperforms when it does outperform, and how much it underperforms when it underperforms.  As JoeTaxpayer's comment suggests, you might not choose to make an investment that had a 99% chance of outperforming debt payment by 1%, and a 1% chance of underperforming by 99%. I think it possible to address these questions by doing simulations.  This can be done even with a spreadsheet, but more flexibly with simple programming.  Essentially you can create some kind of probabilistic model of the various factors (e.g., chance that your investment will go up or down) and see what actually happens: how often you lose a lot of money, lose a little money, gain a little money, or gain a lot of money.  Then based on that you can consult your inner spirit animal to decide whether the probability distribution of possible gains outweighs that of possible losses.",

In your case, you'd enter mean=.114, standard deviation=.132, and \"\"standard score\"\"= ... oh, you didn't say what you're paying on your debt. Let's say it's 6%, i.e. .06. Note that this page will give you the probability that the actual number will be less than or equal to the \"\"standard score\"\". Enter all that and click the magic button and the probability that the investment will produce less than 6% is ... .34124, or 34%. The handy rule of thumb is that the probability is about 68% that the actual number will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% that it will be within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% that it will be within 3. Which isn't exactly what you want because you don't want \"\"within\"\" but \"\"less than\"\". But you could get that by just adding half the difference from 100% for each of the above, i.e. instead of 68-95-99.7 it would be 84-98-99.9. Oh, I missed that in a follow-up comment you say you are paying 4% on a mortgage which you are adjusting to 3% because of tax implications. Probability based on mean and SD you gave of getting less than 3% is 26%. I didn't read the article you cite. I assume the standard deviation given is for the rate of return for one year. If you stretch that over many years, the SD goes down, as many factors tend to even out. So while the probability that money in a given, say, mutual fund will grow by less than 3% in one year is fairly high -- the 25 - 35% we're talking here sounds plausible to me -- the probability that it will grow by an average of less than 3% over a period of 10 or 15 or 20 years is much less. Further Thought There is, of course, no provably-true formula for what makes a reasonable risk. Suppose I offered you an investment that had a 99% chance of showing a $5,000 profit and a 1% chance of a $495,000 loss. Would you take it? I wouldn't. Even though the chance of a loss is small, if it happened, I'd lose everything I have. Is it worth that risk for the modest potential profit? I'd say no. Of course to someone who has a billion dollars, this might be a very reasonable risk. If it fails, oh well, that could really cut in to what he can spend on lunch tomorrow.\"",

        "question": "Invest in low cost small cap index funds when saving towards retirement?",
        "answer": "Investing in low-cost small-cap index funds can be a viable strategy when saving towards retirement, particularly for younger investors who can afford to take on more risk. The document suggests putting a high percentage of investments in both small-cap and large-cap stock indexes, with a recommendation for a younger individual to potentially allocate 10% in bonds, imitating a buy-low-sell-high strategy as the market cycles. As you age and get closer to needing the money, the document advises progressively moving more of the investment into safer categories like bonds to safeguard earnings. The document emphasizes that past performance is not a guarantee of future success, but also notes that such an approach has yielded an average 10% return over two decades, though individual results can vary .\n\nMoreover, the importance of considering investment expenses is highlighted, advising to choose mutual funds with the lowest possible expense ratio, as your profit is what remains after the managers pay themselves. Index funds are recommended over actively managed funds as they tend to be cheaper and most active managers do not beat the market  .\n\nFinally, as the document suggests, the approach towards retirement savings should be consistent with your risk tolerance, age, and investment time horizon. Investing regularly and allowing compound interest to work can significantly contribute to retirement savings. The key is to keep investment expenses low and opt for a diversified portfolio, adjusting the balance between equities and bonds as you approach retirement  .\n\nPlease consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that suits your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.",

        "question": "I might use a credit card convenience check. What should I consider?",
        "answer": "If you're considering using a credit card convenience check, here are some important factors to keep in mind:\n\n1. Interest Charges: Even if you make required payments on time, having a convenience check balance on your account could result in interest charges for your normal credit card charges over the month. This is because the rest of your account could start accruing interest on a daily basis upon the use of a convenience check, even if you pay off your statement balance in full each month .\n\n2. Credit Score Impact: Using a convenience check could potentially affect your credit score, especially if it significantly increases your credit utilization ratio. For instance, going over 20% of your credit utilization may result in a minor drop in your credit score. However, the extent of the impact depends on how high your utilization goes .\n\n3. Promotional Offers: Be cautious with promotional offers that may accompany convenience checks, such as 0% APR for a period. These promotions can be very attractive, but they often come with strict terms. Any violations, such as making a late payment or exceeding your credit limit, can lead to the termination of the promotion and reversion to the normal interest rate or even a penalty rate .\n\n4. Alternative Options: Consider whether there are better alternatives for your financial needs. For example, obtaining another credit card with a balance transfer offer might be beneficial if it comes with perks like an introductory period of no interest. This could be a strategy to manage your debt more effectively, but it's crucial to compare the terms and make sure it makes sense for your situation .\n\nMake sure to carefully review the terms and conditions of using convenience checks and weigh them against your financial goals and circumstances.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Read the terms carefully.  With promotional offers, if you do anything \"\"bad\"\", the promotion is terminated and you immediately revert to either your normal rate or a penalty rate. \"\"Bad\"\" includes things like: making a late payment, going over your limit, paying less than the minimum payment, etc. I wouldn't sweat the potential credit score impacts. These promotions are pretty much the best deals that you can get for an unsecured loan.\"",
            "I tried this a few months ago when I got one from Chase for 0%.  Thought it might be fun to play with, maybe make some money with the interest elsewhere over the 6 months.  Read the term and called Chase for more information on these and didn't see any issues at first.   The big thing that got me was that the rest of my account (not the money from the convenience check) was converted so that interests accrued on a daily basis even if you paid it all off at the end of the month.  So even though I was making the required payments that would normally not incur any interest, just by having the convince check balance on my account I was being charged the interest for my normal credit card charges over the month.   The amount of charges came out to only be around $10-$20, so wasn't much of a loss really.  But something to keep in mind when using these, (I tried it with 0% APR and still couldn't get away from the interest).  If I had needed the money this would still be an excellent way to go.  But if your trying to beat Chase with this game, it doesn't work...  Although if you don't use the card for anything other than the convenience check it's free money (or cheap @ 3.99% in your case) Everything in my account went back to normal after it was paid off, so no harm really, but some things to keep in mind at least.",
            "Well, you might take a minor hit to your credit score. This is snapshot of my credit utilization written for an article on my site.

I'd not lose sleep over it. Kind of you to help."

        "question": "Is it a good idea to get an unsecured loan to pay off a credit card that won't lower a high rate?",
        "answer": "Whether it is a good idea to get an unsecured loan to pay off a high-rate credit card depends on several financial factors and personal circumstances. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Interest Rates**: If the interest rate on the unsecured loan is lower than the credit card's rate, it could save you money on interest payments over time.\n\n2. **Repayment Terms**: Look at the repayment term of the unsecured loan. A longer term might lower your monthly payments but could result in higher total interest paid over the life of the loan.\n\n3. **Credit Impact**: Opening a new loan will have an impact on your credit score. If managed well (e.g., timely payments), it could improve your score over time. However, opening new credit accounts can also lower your score in the short term.\n\n4. **Fees and Penalties**: Check for any origination fees, prepayment penalties, or other charges associated with the unsecured loan.\n\n5. **Spending Habits**: Paying off the credit card with a loan doesn't address the underlying issue if there's a pattern of overspending. Without changing your spending habits, there's a risk of accumulating more credit card debt.\n\n6. **Financial Strategy**: Some people choose a debt consolidation loan as part of a larger financial strategy to manage debt more effectively. Be sure this strategy aligns with your financial goals.\n\n7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have some savings set aside for emergencies. Taking a loan to pay off a credit card shouldn't deplete your reserves.\n\n8. **Other Options**: Explore other options, such as balance transfer credit cards, credit counseling, or negotiating with the credit card company for a lower rate.\n\n9. **Budget and Plan**: Make sure you have a solid budget and a plan to not only pay off the new loan but also to avoid falling back into high credit card debt.\n\nBefore making a decision, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation. If you're looking for information specific to the document you uploaded, let me perform an analysis to check if it contains any relevant advice or information.

Also, once you call to actually cancel the card you will see for sure whether they really have any power to negotiate rates. From their perspective 15% APR is more than 0%APR which is what they'd get if they lose your business.",
            "I think it depends on how you're approaching paying off the credit card. If you're doing some sort of debt snowball and/or throw all available cash at the card, it's not likely to matter much. If you're paying a set amount close to the minimum each month then you're probably better off getting a loan, use it to pay off the card and cut up the card. Well, I'd do the latter in either case... Mathematically it would matter if the interest rate on the card is 10%-15% higher than the personal loan but if you're throwing every spare dime at the card and the some, it might not matter. Another option if you have the discipline to pay the debt off quickly is to see if you can find a card with a cheap balance transfer, move the balance over and close the inflexible card.",
            "I am answering this in light of the OP mentioning the desire to buy a house.  A proper mortgage uses debt to income ratios. Typically 28/36 which means 28% of monthly gross can go toward PITI (principal, interest, tax, insurance) and the total debt can go as high as 36% including credit cards and car payment etc. So, if you earn $5000/mo (for easy math) the 8% gap (between 28 and 36) is $400. If you have zero debt, they don't let you use it for the mortgage, it's just ignored. So a low interest long term student loan should not be accelerated if you are planning to buy a house, better put that money to the down payment. But for credit cards, the $400/mo carries $8000 (banks treat it as though the payment is 5% of debt owed). So, I'd attack that debt with a vengeance.  No eating out, no movies, beer, etc. Pay it off as if your life depended on it, and you'll be happier in the long run.",

        "question": "How does the bank/IRS know whether a bank transfer over $14k is a gift or loan repayment?",
        "answer": "The distinction between a gift and a loan repayment for bank transfers over $14,000 is primarily determined by the intent of the parties involved and must be substantiated with appropriate documentation and filings.\n\nWhen a transfer in excess of $14,000 from the US is made and is intended as a gift, it will attract gift tax according to IRS guidelines. The donor is required to declare the gift while filing their Income Tax in the US and pay the gift tax accordingly. If the transfer is a loan repayment, particularly if it involves interest, the lender must report the interest payment as income on their yearly tax return. However, it's important to note that if the proceeds from the loan are used for personal or non-business purposes, no deduction is allowed.\n\nFor no-interest loans, the IRS takes a strict view. The agency\u2019s tax rules on no-interest loans are quite complex. In these cases, the IRS will treat the transaction as if the borrower paid interest at the applicable federal rate to the lender and that the lender subsequently gifted the interest back to the borrower. As a result, the lender is taxed on the imaginary interest income and could also be liable for gift tax on the imaginary payment made back to the borrower.\n\nIn any cases that involve substantial money transfers and potential tax implications, it is advisable for the parties involved to seek professional tax advice to ensure compliance with IRS rules and regulations.",

You said you paid his tuition, and he is now paying you back, so in case someone asks, you should be able to produce the documentation on the tuition payment - a bill, or your bank statement showing you paid it; and the amount should be matching, so you have proof.

            "\"I'm in the \"\"big mortgage\"\" camp. Or, to put this another way - what would you be happier to have in 15 years? A house that is worth $300,000, or $50,000 of equity in a house and $225,000 in the bank? I would much rather have the latter; it gives me so many more options.  (the numbers are rough; you can figure it out yourself based on the current interest rate you can get on investments vs the cost of mortgage interest (which may be less if you can deduct the mortgage interest)).\"",
            "\"If you are investing in a mortgage strictly to avoid taxes, the answer is \"\"pay cash now.\"\"  A mortgage buys you flexibility, but at the cost of long term security, and in most cases, an overall decrease in wealth too.  At a very basic level, I have to ask anyone why they would pay a bank a dollar in order to avoid paying the government 28 - 36 cents depending on your tax rate. After all, one can only deduct interest- not principal. Interest is like rent, it accrues strictly to the lender, not equity. In theory the recipient should be irrelevant. If you have a need to stiff the government, go ahead. Just realize you making a banker three times as happy.  Additionally the peace of mind that comes from having a house that no banker can take away from you is, at least for me, compelling. If I have a $300,000 house with no mortgage, no payments, etc. I feel quite safe. Even if my money is tied up in equity, if a serious situation came along (say a huge doctors bill) I always have the option of a reverse mortgage later on. So, to directly counter other claims, yes, I'd rather have $300k in equity then $50k in equity and $225k in liquid assets. (Did you notice that the total net worth is $25k less? And that's even before one considers the cash flow implication of a continuing mortgage.  I have no mortgage, and I'm 41. I have a lot of net worth, but the thing that I really like is that I have a roof over my head that no on e can take away from me, and sufficient savings to weather most crises).  That said, a mortgage is not about total cost. It is about cash flow. To the extent that a mortgage makes your cash flow situation better, it provides a benefit- just not one that is quantifiable in dollars and cents. Rather, it is a risk/reward situation. By taking a mortgage even when you have the cash, you pay a premium (the interest rate) in order to have your funds available when you need it.  A very simple strategy to calculate and/or minimize this risk would be to invest the funds in another investment. If your rate of return exceeds the interest rate minus any tax preference (e.g. 4% minus say a 25% deduction = 3%), your money is better off there, obviously. And, indeed, when interest rates are only 4%, it may may be possible to find that. That said, in most instances, a CD or an inflation protected bond or so won't give you that rate of return. There, you'd need to look at stocks- slightly more risky. When interest rates are back to normal- say 5 or 6%, it gets even harder.  If you could, however, find a better return than the effective interest rate, it makes the most sense to do that investment, hold it as a hedge to pay off the mortgage (see, you get your security back if you decide not to work!), and pocket the difference. If you can't do that, your only real reason to hold the cash should be the cash flow situation.\"",

When a family budgets for housing, and uses a 25% target, this number isn't much different for rent vs for the mortgage cost. So how, exactly do the numbers work out for a couple trying to save the next 80% of the home cost? A normal qualifying ration allows a house that costs about 3X one's income. A pay-in-full couple might agree to be conservative and drop to 2X. Are they on an austerity plan, saving 20% of their income in addition to paying the rent? Since the money must be invested conservatively, is it keeping up with house prices? After 10 years, inflation would be pushing the house cost up 30% or so, so is this a 12-15 year plan?  I'm happy to ignore the tax considerations. But I question the math of the whole process. It would seem there's a point where the mortgage (plus expenses) add up to less than the rent.

Revenue is the company's gross income, which is based on the actual products or services sold, not on the trading of its stock. The quoted stock prices you see on exchanges or financial news are the result of third parties buying and selling shares to each other, not a direct sale by the company itself .\n\nHowever, the stock price can indirectly affect a company's financial capacity if the company needs to finance itself through equity in the future and cannot raise as much capital due to a lower stock price. In such a case, the company may need to rely more on debt, which could increase its cost of capital, or obtain less financing overall, which could affect cash available for operations or expansion . Nonetheless, it's important to understand that financing, whether obtained from debt or stock issuance, does not affect earnings directly because it is neither revenue nor expense. It only alters the assets (cash) and liabilities (debt) or shareholder equity in the company's balance sheet .\n\nIn summary, while the stock price itself does not contribute to the company's income and is not part of the income statement, significant changes in stock price can have an impact on a company's ability to finance through equity, thus potentially affecting its cash for future operations or growth indirectly.",

An analogy that can be made is that of selling a used car. When you sell a used car to a third person, the maker of your car is unaffected by this transaction and the same goes for stock trading. Still within the same analogy, when the car is first sold, money goes directly to the maker (actually more complicated than that but good enough for our purposes). In the case of stock trading, this is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO) / Seasoned Public Offering (SPO), for most purposes. What this means is that a drop of value on a secondary market does not directly affect earning potential. Let me add some nuance to this. Say this drop from 20$ to 10$ is permanent and this company needs to finance itself through equity (stock) in the future. It is likely that it would not be able to obtain as much financing in this matter and would either 1) have to rely more on debt and raise its cost of capital or 2) obtain less financing overall. This could potentially affect earnings through less cash available from financing. One last note: in any case, financing does not affect earnings except through cost of capital (i.e. interest paid) because it is neither revenue nor expense. Financing obtained from debt increases assets (cash) and liabilities (debt) and financing obtained from stock issuance increases assets (cash) and shareholder equity.",
            "No.  Revenue is the company's gross income.  The stock price has no contribution to the company's income.  The stock price may be affected when the company's income deviates from what it was expected to be.",
            "Look at the how the income statement is built. The stock price is nowhere on it. The net income is based on the revenue (money coming in) and expenses (money going out).  Most companies do not issue stock all that often. The price you see quoted is third parties selling the stock to each other.",
            "If the company reported a loss at the previous quarter when the stock what at say $20/share, and now just before the company's next quarterly report, the stock trades around $10/share. There is a misunderstanding here, the company doesn't sell stock, they sell products (or services). Stock/share traded at equity market. Here is the illustration/chronology to give you better insight:   Now addressing the question What if the stock's price change? Let say, Its drop from $10 to $1 Is it affect XYZ revenue ? No why? because XYZ selling ads not their stocks the formula for revenue revenue = products (in this case: ads) * quantity the equation doesn't involve capital (stock's purchasing)",

It would cause divergent feedback loops which would create unrepresentative financial documents and stock prices.  That's how your question would be interpreted if true.  This is not the case. Stock prices are never mentioned on the financial documents.  The stock price you hear being reported is information provided by parties who are not reporting as part of the company.  The financial documents are provided by the company.  They will be audited internally and externally to make sure that they can be presented to the market. Stock prices are quoted and arbitrated by brokers at the stock exchange or equivalent service.  They are negotiated and the latest sale tells you what it has sold for.  What price this has been reported never works its way onto the financial document. So what use are stock prices are for those within the company?  The stock price is very useful for guessing how much money they can raise by issuing stock or buying back stock.  Raising money is important for expansion of the company or to procure money for when avenues of debt are not optimal; buying back stock is important if major shareholders want more control of the company."

        "question": "Why are auto leases stubbornly strict about visa status and how to work around that?",
        "answer": "Auto leases are usually strict about visa status because leasing companies may perceive there to be a greater risk of lessees not remaining in the country for the entire period of the lease . This concern is due to the uncertain nature of visa renewals and the potential for individuals to leave the country before fulfilling the terms of the lease. One potential workaround mentioned is starting with your bank or credit union for a loan instead, as they may offer better rates and terms than dealer financing and be more understanding of your situation .\n\nThe document suggests that a lease might not be the best option for the average consumer because you end up paying for the car's most expensive months and end up with no car at the end of the lease. Instead, by getting a loan through a bank or credit union, not only do you potentially get better terms, but you also get to keep the car after you\u2019ve finished paying for it .\n\nTo work around strict leasing policies due to visa issues, you may consider buying a used car outright, as suggested in the file, which could potentially save you from the strict terms and additional fees associated with leasing. Selling the car when you are ready to leave could recoup your initial expenditure, provided the car maintains its value and you manage to sell it for approximately what you paid .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Uh, you want to lease a car through a dealer? That is the worst possible way to obtain a car. Dealers love leases because it allows them to sell a car for an unnegotiated price and to hide additional fees. It's the most profitable kind of sale for them. The best option would be to buy a used car off of Craigslist or eBay, then sell it again the same way when you leave. If you sell the car for what you paid, then you get the car for a year for free. If you are determined to go through with the expensive, risky and annoying plan of leasing a car, then you should use a leasing agent. I recommend reading some car buying guides before going out into the wilderness with the tigers and bears. Comment on Leasing Tricks Don't get tricked by the \"\"interest rate\"\" game. The whole interest thing is just a distraction to trick you into think you are getting some kind of reasonable deal. The leasing company makes most of their money from fees. For example, if you get into an accident it is a big payday for them. The average person thinks they will never get into an accident, but the reality is that most people get into an accident sooner or later. They also collect big penalties for \"\"maintenance failures\"\". Forget to change the oil? BOOM! money. Forget to comply with manufacture recall? BOOM! more money. Forget to do the annual service? BOOM! more money. Scratch the car? BOOM! more money. The original car mats are missing? BOOM! you just paid $400 for a set of mats that cost the leasing company $25 bucks. The leasing company is counting on the fact that 99% of people will not maintain the car correctly or will damage it in some way. They also usually have all kinds of other bogus fees, so-called \"\"walk-away fees\"\", \"\"disposition fees\"\", \"\"initiation fees\"\". Whatever they think they can get away with. The whole system is calculated to screw you.\"",
            "When getting a car always start with your bank or credit union. They are very likely to offer better loan rate than the dealer. Because you start there you have a data point so you can tell if the dealer is giving you a good rate.  Having the loan approved before going to the dealer allows you to negotiate the best deal for the purchase price for the car. When you are negotiating price, length of loan, down payment, and trade in it can get very confusing to determine if the deal is a good one. Sometimes you can also get a bigger rebate or discount because to the dealer you are paying cash. The general advice is that a lease for the average consumer is a bad deal. You are paying for the most expensive months, and at the end of the lease you don't have a car. With a loan you keep the car after you are done paying for it. Another reason to avoid the lease. It allows you to purchase a car that is two or three years old. These are the ones that just came off lease. I am not a car dealer, and I have never needed a work visa, but I think their concern is that there is a greater risk of you not being in the country for the entire period of the lease.",
            "In the U.S., most car dealers provide lease financing through one company (usually a subsidiary of the auto manufacturer). Whereas they provide loan financing through a variety of companies, some of whom offer very high interest rate loans and sell the loans as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).

It is typical for employee share options to not require cash layout for exercise, except in certain cases such as if an employee is leaving the company and does not want to exercise the options .\n\n2. When exercising options, you are taxed in the US on the profit from those shares. The tax implications are based on the difference between the actual stock price and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares, minus fees .\n\n3. There can be short-term capital gains and alternative minimum tax (AMT) income implications when exercising options and selling shares back to the employer. The exact tax outcome will depend on various factors, including the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise .\n\n4. The general rule with stock options is that it's often best to wait until expiration to exercise them, but there are exceptions and one should verify the tax implications with a professional tax advisor .\n\n5. Employee stock option plans usually result in regular income tax being assessed between the exercise price and the current price at the time of exercise, with capital gains tax applied upon eventual sale of the shares .\n\n6. The document advises caution regarding being significantly invested in one's employer's company, as it carries a higher risk if the company faces difficulties .\n\n7. For employee stock purchase plans, if the shares are issued from treasury stock, it typically does not affect the open market share price. However, if the shares are purchased on the open market, it could potentially impact the share price .\n\n8. The document also discusses special cases such as what happens to unvested restricted stock units or options during a buyout, with immediate vesting often applying to key employees or under specific provisions like a Change in/of Control .\n\nThese points give a general understanding of some considerations that employees might have when deciding how and when to exercise their share options.

            "\"I'm not aware that any US bank has any way to access your credit rating in France (especially as you basically don't have one!). In the US, banks are not the only way to get finance for a home.  In many regions, there are plenty of \"\"owner financed\"\" or \"\"Owner will carry\"\" homes.  For these, the previous owner will provide a private mortgage for the balance if you have a large (25%+) downpayment.  No strict lending rules, no fancy credit scoring systems, just a large enough downpayment so they know they'll get their money back if they have to foreclose.  For the seller, it's a way to shift a house that is hard to sell plus get a regular income. Often this mortgage is for only 3-10 years, but that gives you the time to establish more credit and then refinance.  Maybe the interest rate is a little higher also, but again it's just until you can refinance to something better (or sell other assets then pay the loan off quick). For new homes, the builders/developers may offer similar finance. For both owner-will-carry and developer finance, a large deposit will trump any credit rating concerns.  There is usually a simplified foreclosure process, so they're not really taking much of a risk, so can afford to be flexible. Make sure the owner mortgage is via a title company, trust company, or escrow company, so that there's a third party involved to ensure each party lives up to their obligations.\""

        "question": "Paying for things on credit and immediately paying them off: any help for credit rating?",
        "answer": "Paying for things on credit and promptly paying them off has the potential to impact your credit rating positively. Credit utilization, which is the amount of your credit limit that you're using at any given time, is one of the factors that credit scoring models consider. By using your cards and then paying them off in full each month, you demonstrate responsible credit usage without incurring interest charges. This practice can be beneficial to your credit score, as it shows that you're able to manage credit well .\n\nA balance that is reported at the end of the month is what credit rating agencies tend to look at, not the amounts you may carry and pay off throughout the month. Therefore, it's the amount on your statement that counts towards your utilization rate, not whether you carry a balance and accrue interest. To optimize your credit score, you might want some activity on your credit cards but keep it above 0% and below around 30% of your credit limits .\n\nIt's important to remember that while favorable credit behavior can contribute to a good credit rating over time, taking out loans or using credit cards just to improve your credit is usually not advised unless it is part of a well-considered financial plan. Credit scores are most influenced by long-term financial behavior rather than short-term actions .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"One of the factors of a credit score is the \"\"length of time revolving accounts have been established\"\". Having a credit card with any line of credit will help in this regard. The account will age regardless of your use or utilization. If you are having issues with credit limits and no credit history, you may have trouble getting financing for the purchase. You should be sure you're approved for financing, and not just that the financing option is \"\"available\"\" (potentially with the caveat of \"\"for well qualified borrowers\"\"). Generally, if you've gotten approved for financing, that will come in the form of another credit card account (many contracting and plumbing companies will do this in hopes you will use the card for future purchases) or a bank loan account (more common for auto and home loans). With the credit card account, you might be able to perform a balance transfer, but there are usually fees associated with that. For bank loan accounts, you probably can't pay that off with a credit card. You'll need to transfer money to the account via ACH or send in a check. In short: I wouldn't bet on paying with your current credit card to get any benefit. IANAL. Utilizing promotional offers, whether interest-free for __ months, no balance transfer fees, or whatever, and passing your debt around is not illegal, not fraudulent, and in many cases advised (this is a link), though that is more for people to distribute utilization across multiple cards, and to minimize interest accrued. Many people, myself included, use a credit card for purchasing EVERYTHING, then pay it off in full every month (or sometimes immediately) to reap the benefit of cash back rewards and other cardholder benefits. I've also made a major payment (tuition, actually) on a Discover card, and opened up a new Visa card with 18-months of no interest and no balance transfer fees to let the bill sit for 12 months while I finished school and got a job.\"",
            "The biggest risk is Credit Utilization rate.  If you have a total of $10,000 in revolving credit (ie: credit card line) and you ever have more than 50% (or 33% to be conservative) on the card at any time then your credit score will be negatively impacted. This will be a negative impact even if you charge it on day one and pay it off in full on day 2.  Doesn't make much sense but credit companies are playing the averages:  on average they find that people who get close to maxing their credit limit are in some sort of financial trouble. You're better off to make small purchases each month, under $100, and pay them off right away.  That will build a better credit history - and score."

        "answer": "\"Leveraged debt investment positions\" refer to investment strategies where an investor uses borrowed money to increase their investment capacity. In this context, leverage means using financial instruments or borrowed capital, such as margin, to increase the potential return of an investment. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses, meaning that while the potential return on an investment can be magnified, the potential losses are also increased proportionally. This is especially relevant in the context of the 2008 financial crisis, which is referenced as an example of the risks associated with high degrees of leverage .\n\n\"Exposures\" in financial terms relate to the amount of risk that an investor or financial institution has taken on through their investment activities. In practice, exposure measures the potential loss an investor might sustain from a particular risk, whether it's for an individual position, a portfolio of positions, or the exposure one bank has towards another. It is often quantified as the percentage of the investor\u2019s total assets that are at risk. Therefore, when an investor has \"exposures\" to certain asset classes or markets, they have a financial stake that could lead to gains or losses depending on the performance of those assets .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Exposure is the amount of money that you are at risk of losing on a given position (i.e. on a UST 10 year bond), portfolio of positions, strategy (selling covered calls for example), or counterparty, usually represented as a percentage of your total assets. Interbank exposure is the exposure of banks to other banks either through owning debt or stock, or by having open positions with the other banks as counterparties. Leveraging occurs when the value of your position is more than the value of what you are trading in. One example of this is borrowing money (i.e. creating debt for yourself) to buy bonds. The amount of your own funds that you are using to pay for the position is \"\"leveraged\"\" by the debt so that you are risking more than 100% of your capital if, for example, the bond became worthless). Another example would be buying futures \"\"on margin\"\" where you only put up the margin value of the trade and not the full cost. The problem with these leveraged positions is what happens if a credit event (default etc.) happens. Since a large amount of the leverage is being \"\"passed on\"\" as banks are issuing debt to buy other banks' debt who are issuing debt to buy debt there is a risk that a single failure could cause an unravelling of these leveraged positions and, since the prices of the bonds will be falling resulting in these leveraged positions losing money, it will cause a cascade of losses and defaults. If a leveraged position becomes worth less than the amount of real (rather than borrowed or margined) money that was put up to take the position then it is almost inevitable that the firm in that position will default on the requirements for the leverage. When that firm defaults it sparks all of the firms who own that debt to go through the same problems that it did, hence the contagion.\""

        "answer": "Securing a home loan with a poor credit history after a divorce may be challenging, but it's not necessarily impossible. The ability to obtain a home loan will greatly depend on your current financial situation, including your income, debts, and the specific reasons behind your poor credit history. Lenders will assess your creditworthiness, which can be affected by the outcome of a divorce, especially if it resulted in financial difficulties that impacted your credit score.\n\nIf you have undergone recent credit inquiries (known as \"hard pulls\"), opened new accounts with zero history, or increased your debt, this might initially lower your credit scores. Over time, responsibly managing your credit can improve your credit rating. However, if a loan is not paid properly, it will negatively affect your credit, and you may still be held liable for the debt acquired during the marriage, depending on the divorce settlement and local laws .\n\nIt's essential to note that credit ratings come from multiple credit bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion, or Experian), and a loan reported to one bureau will not affect the ratings from the others. Therefore, the impact on your ability to secure a loan could also depend on which bureau's rating the lender considers.\n\nIf you are considering a home loan post-divorce, it may be helpful to focus on rebuilding your credit in ways that do not cost money, such as responsibly managing a credit card or other lines of credit. It's important to tread carefully, as taking out a loan specifically to improve credit is usually not advisable unless part of a well-researched and vetted plan.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's best to speak directly with financial advisors or lenders to discuss your specific situation and explore potential opportunities for obtaining a home loan despite having a poor credit history after a divorce.

Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy.

You will probably have to refinance the car in your name only.  Do you have sufficient credit?  Once this happens can you pay off the car in like a year or so? If you search this site a similar questions is asked about once per month.  Car loans are pretty terrible, in the future you should avoid them.  Cosigning is even worse and you should never again participate in such a thing. Another option is to just sell the car and start over with your own car hopefully paid for in cash.\"",
            "Your best bet is to refinance the car in your own name only. Hopefully a year of making the payments has improved your credit score enough. If not, you can approach a loan officer at a credit union and make your case (that you haven't missed any payments, etc.). A new title should be sent to the new lien holder, and  in that process, if your ex needs to sign any paperwork, it can be done while refinancing.",
            "\"You are co-signer on his car loan. You have no ownership (unless the car is titled in both names).  One option (not the best, see below) is to buy the car from him.  Arrange your own financing (take over his loan or get a loan of your own to pay him for the car).  The bank(s) will help you take care of getting the title into your name.  And the bank holding the note will hold the title as well. Best advice is to get with him, sell the car. Take any money left after paying off the loan and use it to buy (cash purchase, not finance) a reliable, efficient, used car -- if you truly need a car at all. If you can get to work by walking, bicycling or public transit, you can save thousands per year, and perhaps use that money to start you down the road to \"\"financial independence\"\".  Take a couple of hours and research this.  In the US, we tend to view cars as necessary, but this is not always true.  (Actually, it's true less than half the time.) Even if you cannot, or choose not to, live within bicycle distance of work, you can still reduce your commuting cost by not financing, and by driving a fuel efficient vehicle.  Ask yourself, \"\"Would you give up your expensive vehicle if it meant retiring years earlier?\"\"  Maybe as many as ten years earlier.\""

        "question": "How do auto-loan payments factor into taxes for cars that are solely used by dependent(s)?",
        "answer": "In calculating support costs for tax purposes, you can include the costs incurred for transportation, such as auto-loan payments for a car that is used by your dependent. However, to claim a dependent on your taxes, you must generally provide more than half of their financial support during the tax year, which can include the cost of providing a car for transportation. If there is an arrangement where a sibling uses the car and in exchange they cover additional costs for the dependent, this can also be considered part of your support expenses as long as it is a true agreement.\n\nIf you are considering claiming someone as a dependent, and there are others who might also provide support, you may want to have an agreement like Form 2120 in place to clarify who is claiming the dependent. Nonetheless, in practice, if there is a verbal agreement between you and other potential supporters that you will claim the individual and nobody else will, it's unlikely to cause any problems. The signed agreement is a conservative approach to documentation in this regard.\n\nIt's important to refer to the IRS Publication 17 for detailed information and guidance on support costs, including transportation costs, and multiple support agreements.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "It only matters for purposes of the dependent, so if you are clearly at 50%, then you don't need to calculate this cost.  If it is close to not being 50%, then you will have to allocate between your sister and mother.  To calculate support costs, you can of course include the costs incurred for transportation, per Pub 17 p 34.  If you and your sister have an arrangement where she uses the car and in exchange she shoulders extra costs for your mother, then that's legitimately your expense for your mother (as long as this is a true agreement, then it was money she owed you but paid directly to the vendors and creditors that you would have paid). Note that there is a simpler avenue.  If your sister agrees that you will claim your mother as dependent, and nobody else provides any substantial support (10%+ of costs), then she can just agree that it's you who will claim her.  If you like, such an agreement may be attached to your taxes, possibly using Form 2120.  As a general rule, though, you do not need to use 2120 or any other agreement, nor submit any support calculations.  If your sister verbally agrees that she hasn't and won't claim your mother, then it's unlikely to cause any problems.  Her signed agreement not to claim your mother is merely the most conservative possible documentation strategy, but isn't really necessary.  See Pub 17, p 35 on Multiple Support Agreements for more info.",
            "I don't see how allowing usage of your vehicle is less support than giving money to buy their own vehicle. If that's the only vehicle your mother has - then you're supporting her. Quantifying that support may be difficult though, but if you are providing her all of her needs - it doesn't matter. If she does have income of her own, I do not think that you can put the actual amount you're paying as part of the calculation towards the 50% rule since she would otherwise have bought a much cheaper car. But if you pass the 50% threshold even without the car payments - then you're fine either way."

        "question": "Paying off a loan with a loan to get a better interest rate",
        "answer": "The concept of paying off a loan with another loan to get a better interest rate is known as refinancing. This can be a useful strategy if you're able to secure a new loan with a lower interest rate than your existing loan, as it can lead to significant savings on interest payments over the life of the loan. Here are some considerations mentioned in the document regarding refinancing:\n\n1. It's important to calculate the overall cost of refinancing, including any hidden fees or closing costs that might be associated with the new loan, to ensure that you're actually saving money compared to your current loan .\n\n2. When refinancing, it's recommended to avoid extending the term of the new loan beyond what is remaining on the original loan. Extending the term could mean you'll pay more in interest, negating the benefit of a lower interest rate .\n\n3. If the new loan has lower interest rates, consider making the same payment amount as before, even if the required payment is lower. This approach allows you to pay off the loan faster and save money on interest over time .\n\n4. Keep an eye on the possible fees associated with the new loan. Make sure the loan fees aren't higher than the interest rate savings from the new loan. Auto loans, for example, typically have lower fees than mortgages, but they still need to be factored into the decision .\n\nIn summary, refinancing to pay off an existing loan with a new loan for a better interest rate can be a smart financial move, but you need to carefully consider all associated costs and ensure that the new loan terms are actually advantageous for your situation.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "I don't know what rates are available to you now, but yes, if you can refinance your car at a better rate with no hidden fees, you might save some money in interest. However, there are a couple of watchouts: Your original loan was a 6 year loan, and you have 5 years remaining.  If you refinance your car with a new 6 year loan, you will be paying on your car for 7 years total, and you will end up paying more interest even though your interest rate might have gone down.  Make sure that your new loan, in addition to having a lower rate than the old loan, does not have a longer term than what you have remaining on the original loan. Make sure there aren't any hidden fees or closing costs with the new loan.  If there are, you might be paying your interest savings back to the bank in fees. If your goal is to save money in interest, consider paying off your loan early.  Scrape together extra money every month and send it in, making sure that it is applied to the principal of your loan.  This will shorten your loan and save you money on interest, and can be much more significant than refinancing.  After your loan is paid off, continue saving the amount you were spending on your car payment, so you can pay cash for your next car and save even more.",
            "If it's possible in your case to get such a loan, then sure, providing the loan fees aren't in excess of the interest rate difference.  Auto loans don't have the fees mortgages do, but check the specific loan you're looking at - it may have some fees, and they'd need to be lower than the interest rate savings. Car loans can be tricky to refinance, because of the value of a used car being less than that of a new car.  How much better your credit is likely determines how hard this would be to get.  Also, how much down payment you put down.  Cars devalue 20% or so instantly (a used car with 5 miles on it tends to be worth around 80% of a new car's cost), so if you put less than 20% down, you may be underwater - meaning the principal left on the loan exceeds the value of the car (and so you wouldn't be getting a fully secured loan at that point). However, if your loan amount isn't too high relative to the value of the car, it should be possible.  Check out various lenders in advance; also check out non-lender sites for advice.  Edmunds.com has some of this laid out, for example (though they're an industry-based site so they're not truly unbiased). I'd also recommend using this to help you pay off the loan faster.  If you do refinance to a lower rate, consider taking the savings and sending it to the lender - i.e., keeping your payment the same, just lowering the interest charge.  That way you pay it off faster.",
            "Dude- my background is in banking specifically dealing with these scenarios. Take my advice-look for a balance transfer offer-credit card at 0%. Your cost of capital is your good credit, this is your leverage. Why pay 4.74% when you can pay 0%. Find a credit card company with a balance transfer option for 0%. Pay no interest, and own the car outright. Places to start; check the mail, or check your bank, or check local credit unions. Some credit unions are very relaxed for membership, and ask if they have zero percent balance transfers. Good Luck!",
            "Before we were married my wife financed a car at a terrible rate. I think it was around 20%. When trying to refinance it the remaining loan was much larger than the value of the car, so no one was interested in refinancing. I was able to do a balance transfer to a credit card around 10%. This did take on a bit of risk, which almost came up when the car was totaled in an accident. Fortunately the remaining balance was now less than the value of the car, otherwise I would have been stuck with a credit card payment and no vehicle.",
            "Your current loan is for a new car. Your refinanced loan would probably be for a used car. They have different underwriting standards and used car loan rates are usually higher because of the higher risks associated with the loans. (People with better credit will tend to buy new cars.) This doesn't mean that you can't come out ahead after refinancing but you'll probably have to do a bit of searching. I think you should take a step back though. 5% isn't that much money and five years is a long time. Nobody can predict the future but my experience tells me that the **** is going to hit the fan at least once over any five year period, and it's going to be a really big dump at least once over any ten year period. Do you have savings to cover it or would you have to take a credit card advance at a much higher interest rate? Are you even sure that's an option - a lot of people who planned to use their credit card advances as emergency savings found their credit limits slashed before they could act. I understand the desire to reduce what you pay in interest but BTDT and now I don't hesitate to give savings priority when I have some excess cash. There's no one size fits all answer but should have at least one or two months of income saved up before you start considering anything like loan prepayments."

        "question": "Resources on Buying Rental Properties",
        "answer": "The document provides some valuable insights and advice on buying rental properties:\n\n1. **Landlord Insurance**: You will need landlord insurance to cover potential damages or injuries caused by tenants. It generally costs 15%-20% more than regular homeowner's insurance. It's recommended to assume about $100 per month for a rough estimate when calculating costs, although this might be high.\n\n2. **Rental Profit Projection**: The document cautions that your estimated profit might be on the high side and suggests expecting cash flow per house per year to be closer to $7,000, particularly taking your inexperience into account.\n\n3. **Costs to Consider**: When buying rental properties, remember to account for taxes, insurance, vacancy, repairs, capital expenditures (CapEx), property management, utilities, lawn care, snow removal, and homeowner association (HOA) fees. It is mentioned that usually 50% of your rental income will be spent on the property.\n\n4. **Financial Expertise and Taxes**: It's advised to consult with financial experts who specialize in rental properties, as this can save you money and legal headaches in the long-term. For tax purposes, rental property is treated differently than personal income, so proper planning is important.\n\n5. **Appreciation vs. Depreciation**: Real estate appreciation is not guaranteed, and rental properties depreciate over time. You can claim a certain rate of depreciation as an expense on your taxes, but this means you could sell for less than the purchase price after several years.\n\n6. **Incorporation**: To protect personal assets, it's recommended to form a company that will own the rental properties, hire maintenance and management personnel, take out insurance, and handle taxes. This safeguards your personal finances in case of legal issues, such as tenants suing for damages.\n\n7. **Tenant Management**: It is advised to be capable of performing most maintenance work yourself, as maintenance is a major cost. Furthermore, be cautious about where you invest\u2014some regions are more tenant-friendly than others. It's also recommended to require a minimum credit score for tenants and to manage rent adjustments judiciously to retain good tenants.\n\n8. **Real Estate Investment Strategy**: The document highlights the importance of diversification and suggests that investing in real estate should be approached with caution, specifically regarding the potential risks of putting too much capital into one market or region .\n\nFor more detailed information and guidance, consulting the document directly would be beneficial, as it includes several nuanced points and considerations that could impact your investment decisions.",

        "question": "Tax considerations for selling a property below appraised value to family?",
        "answer": "When selling a property below its appraised value to a family member, there are several tax considerations to keep in mind:\n\n**Deduction of Losses:**\nSelling property at a loss generally allows you to claim a tax deduction. However, when the transaction is between related persons, the ability to deduct a capital loss on your tax return may not be permitted by the IRS, particularly if the buyer is considered a \"related person\" such as a sibling. According to IRS Publication 544, siblings are specifically included in the definition of \"related persons,\" so in most cases, you would not be able to deduct the loss if you sell your property below market value to a sibling .\n\n**Transfer Taxes:**\nThe state may impose certain taxes like transfer/recordation taxes. These can be a percentage of the property's appraised value or sale value. It\u2019s important to check with your local state laws on how this tax is calculated. In some states, property taxes are assessed based on sale value, but if the sale price is considered unreasonably low, the assessors might have the right to recalculate it based on what they determine to be the \"fair market value\" .\n\n**Financing Considerations:**\nIf the buyer needs financing, banks might be suspicious of transactions that involve a significant discount on the property's value. However, if the buyer is a family member, this is less likely to be a problem compared to when the buyer is an unrelated person .\n\n**Professional Guidance:**\nConsidering the complexity of taxes related to real estate transactions, especially those involving family members, it is advisable to consult with a professional tax adviser (EA or CPA licensed in your state). They can provide tailored advice and guide you on the best way to proceed with the transaction while minimizing tax implications .\n\nRemember, tax laws can be complex and vary from state to state, and the above points are general considerations. It's crucial to get professional advice for your specific situation and to comply with the laws applicable in your jurisdiction.",

            "\"Is this legal? Why not? But you might have trouble deducting losses on your taxes, especially if you sell to someone related to you in some way (which is indeed what you're doing). See the added portion below regarding dealing with \"\"related person\"\" (which a sibling is). The state of Maryland has a transfer/recordation tax of 1.5% for each, the buyer and seller. Would this be computed on the appraised or sale value? You should check with the State. In California property taxes are assessed based on sale value, but if the sale value is bogus the assessors have the right to recalculate. Since you're selling to family, the assessors will likely to intervene and set a more close to \"\"fair market\"\" value on the transaction, but again - check the local law. Will this pose any problem if the buyer needs financing? Likely, banks will be suspicious.Since you're giving a discount to your sibling, it will likely not cause a problem for financing. If it was an unrelated person getting such a discount, it would likely to have raised some questions. Would I be able to deduct a capital loss on my tax return? As I said - it may be a problem. If the transaction is between related people - likely not. Otherwise - not sure. Check with a professional tax adviser (EA or CPA licensed in Maryland). You mentioned in the comment that the buyer is a sibling. IRS Publication 544 has a list of what is considered \"\"related person\"\", and that includes siblings. So the short answer is NO, you will not be able to deduct the loss. The tax treatment is not trivial in this case, and I suggest to have a professional tax adviser guide you on how to proceed. Here's the definition of \"\"related person\"\" from the IRS pub. 544: Members of a family, including only brothers, sisters, half-brothers, half-sisters, spouse, ancestors (parents, grandparents,   etc.), and lineal descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.). An individual and a corporation if the individual directly or indirectly owns more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of the   corporation. Two corporations that are members of the same controlled group as defined in section 267(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. A trust fiduciary and a corporation if the trust or the grantor of the trust directly or indirectly owns more than 50% in value of the   outstanding stock of the corporation. A grantor and fiduciary, and the fiduciary and beneficiary, of any trust. Fiduciaries of two different trusts, and the fiduciary and beneficiary of two different trusts, if the same person is the grantor   of both trusts. A tax-exempt educational or charitable organization and a person who directly or indirectly controls the organization, or a member of   that person's family. A corporation and a partnership if the same persons own more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation and more than   50% of the capital interest or profits interest in the partnership. Two S corporations if the same persons own more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of each corporation. Two corporations, one of which is an S corporation, if the same persons own more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of each   corporation. An executor and a beneficiary of an estate unless the sale or exchange is in satisfaction of a pecuniary bequest. Two partnerships if the same persons directly or indirectly own more than 50% of the capital interests or profits interests in both   partnerships. A person and a partnership if the person directly or indirectly owns more than 50% of the capital interest or profits interest in the   partnership.\"",

There are specific publications like Publication 936, which discusses home mortgage interest deductions, and Publication 970, which discusses student loan interest deductions, but there is no publication discussing deductions for interest on loans taken out for medical expenses.

        "question": "Pay off car loan entirely or leave $1 until the end of the loan period?",
        "answer": "In terms of credit scoring, the size of the loan does not have a significant impact; what is crucial is making payments on time and reducing the balance relative to the original loan amount. Paying down loans or mortgages quickly is beneficial for your credit score, as it shows responsible debt management but not necessarily paying them off completely. Keeping a small balance might be useful if you're applying for a mortgage, as it can improve your debt-to-income ratio, thereby possibly qualifying you for a larger loan. However, being completely debt-free does not help your credit, which is important for things like renting a car or obtaining the best insurance rates .\n\nWhen it comes to keeping a car loan open by leaving a small amount, like $1, until the end of the loan period, this strategy might not work as intended. Some financial institutions might absorb the remaining balance and consider the account paid off if the remaining amount is too small, such as $1.00. Instead, it could be better to leave a slightly larger amount, like 10 to 20 percent of the loan, to potentially see more impact on your credit score. If you want the loan to remain active, ensure that the remaining balance is above a threshold, which could be around $100, but avoid leaving an amount as low as $1 as it might lead to the account being closed prematurely  .\n\nThe best action depends on your specific financial goals. If you are looking to increase your credit score, making regular payments on time can be beneficial. However, if you need to free up some debt on your credit report or save on the interest you would otherwise pay over time, paying off the car loan entirely might be the better option .\n\nIn summary, whether you should pay off the car loan entirely or leave a small balance depends on various factors, including your financial goals and how your credit score might be affected. It's always wise to assess both the advantages and disadvantages of each option, keeping in mind the policies of your financial institution regarding closing accounts with minimal remaining balances.",

But here's what makes CAF financing particularly fair - when you do make a payment, your per-diem since your last payment accrued X dollars, and that's your interest portion that is subtracted first from your payment (and obviously per-diem goes down faster the more you pay in a payment), and then EVerything else, including Any extra payments you make - goes to Principal. You do not have to specify that the extra payment(S) are principal only. If your payment amount per month is $500 and you give them 11 payments of $500 - the first $500 will have a small portion go to interest accrued since the last payment - depending on the per-diem that was recalculated, and then EVERYTHING ELSE goes to principal and STILL PUSHES YOUR NEXT DUE DATE (I prefer to break up extra payments as precisely the amount due per month, so that my intention is clear - pay the extra as a payment for the next month, and the one after that, etc, and keep pushing my next due date). That last point of pushing your next due date is the key  - not all car financing companies do that. A lot of them will let you pay to principal yes, but you're still due next month. With CAF, you can have your cake, and eat it too. I worked for them in College - I know their financing system in and out, and I've always financed with them for that very reason.  So, back to the question - should you keep the loan alive, albeit for a small amount. My unprofessional answer is yes! Car loans are very powerful in your credit report because they are installment accounts (same as Mortgages, and other accounts that you pay down to 0 and the loan is closed). Credit cards, are revolving accounts, and don't offer as much bang for your money - unless you are savvy in manipulating your card balances - take it up one month, take it down to 0 the next month, etc. I play those games a lot - but I always find mortgage and auto loans make the best impact.  I do exactly what you do myself - I pay off the car down to about $500 (I actually make several small payments each equal to the agreed upon Monthly payment because their system automatically treats that as a payment for the next month due, and the one after that, etc - on top of paying it all to principal as I mentioned).  DO NOT leave a dollar, as another reader mentioned - they have a \"\"good will\"\" threshold, I can't remember how much - probably $50, for which they will consider the account paid off, and close it out. So, if your concern is throwing away free money but you still want the account alive, your \"\"sweet spot\"\" where you can be sure the loan is not closed, is probably around $100.  BUT....something else important to consider if you decide to go with that strategy of keeping the account alive (which I recommend). In my case, CAF will adjust down your next payment due, if it's less than the principal left. SO, let's say your regular payment is $400 and you only leave a $100, your next payment due is $100 (and it will go up a few cents each month because of the small per-diem), and that is exactly what CAF will report to the credit bureaus as your monthly obligation - which sucks because now your awesome car payment history looks like you've only been paying $100 every month - so, leave something close to one month's payment (yes, the interest accrued will be higher - but I'm not a penny-pincher when the reward is worth it - if you left $400 for 1.5 years at 10% APR - that equates to about $50 interest for that entire time - well worth it in my books. Sorry for rambling a lot, I suck myself into these debates all the time :)\"",
            "\"There's two scenarios: the loan accrues interest on the remaining balance, or the total interest was computed ahead of time and your payments were averaged over x years so your payments are always the same. The second scenarios is better for the bank, so guess what you probably have... In the first scenario, I would pay it off to avoid paying interest. (Unless there is a compelling reason to keep the cash available for something else, and you don't mind paying interest) In the second case, you're going to pay \"\"interest over x years\"\" as computed when you bought the car no matter how quickly you pay it off, so take your time. (If you pay it earlier, it's like paying interest that would not have actually accrued, since you're paying it off faster than necessary) If you pay it off, I'm not sure if it would \"\"close\"\" the account, your credit history might show the account as being paid, which is a good thing.\"",
            "Not sure if it is the same in the States as it is here in the UK (or possibly even depends on the lender) but if you have any amount outstanding on the loan then you wouldn't own the vehicle, the loan company would. This often offers extra protection if something goes wrong with the vehicle - a loan company talking to the manufacturer to get it resolved carries more weight than an individual. The laon company will have an army of lawyers (should it get that far) and a lot more resources to deal with anything, they may also throw in a courtesy car etc.",
            "In some states there are significantly higher automobile insurance costs and higher coverage requirements for vehicles that have a lien on them.  I suspect this is not your scenario, or you probably would not be considering holding the loan open.  But it is something to consider. If you live in a state where insurance coverage and costs depend on a clear title, I would certainly recommend closing the loan as soon as possible.",
            "As an FYI, working for a lending company, I can tell you many have a dollar amount limit that they'll just write off at the end of the month/quarter/etc just to get the loan off the books.  It's a little goofy, but I actually bothered to plan ahead and save $9.99 on my student loans since the lender would close out all accounts with a < $10 balance.",
            "what you aim to do is a great idea and it will work in your favor for a number of reasons. First, paying down your loan early will save you lots in interest, no brainer. Second, keeping the account open will improve your credit score by 1) increases the number of installment trade lines you have open, 2)adds to your positive payment history and 3) varies your credit mix. If your paid your car off you will see a DROP in your credit score because now you have one less trade line. To address other issues as far as credit scoring, it does not matter(much) for your score if you have a $1000 car loan or a $100,000 car loan. what matters is whether or not you pay on time, and what your balance is compared to the original loan amount. So the quicker you pay DOWN the loans or mortgages the better. Pay them down, not off! As far how the extra payments will report, one of two things will happen. Either they will report every month paid as agreed (most likely), or they wont report anything for a few years until your next payment is due(unlikely, this wont hurt you but wont help you either). Someone posted they would lower the amount you paid every month on your report and thus lower your score. This is not true. even if they reported you paid $1/ month the scoring calculations do not care. All they care is whether or not you're on time, and in your case you would be months AHEAD of time(even though your report cant reflect this fact either) HOWEVER, if you are applying for a mortgage the lower monthly payment WOULD affect you in the sense that now you qualify for a BIGGER loan because now your debt to income ratio has improved. People will argue to just pay it off and be debt free, however being debt free does NOT help your credit. And being that you own a home and a car you see the benefits of good credit. You can have a million dollars in the bank but you will be denied a loan if you have NO or bad credit.  Nothing wrong with living on cash, I've done it for years, but good luck trying to rent a car, or getting the best insurance rates, and ANYTHING in life with poor credit. Yeah it sucks but you have to play the game. I would not pay down do $1 though because like someone else said they may just close the account. Pay it down to 10 or 20 percent and you will see the most impact on your credit and invest the rest of your cash elsewhere.",
            "Nobody outside of the credit scoring agencies know exactly what goes into the scoring formula. That said, I don't think there is any evidence that keeping a fixed loan (car or mortgage) open is necessary to keep its effect on your score. It doesn't improve your utilization ratio like an open revolving credit line would. And depending on the exact details of how your specific lender reports the loan, it might appear detrimental to your debt-to-income ratio.  I would simply pay it off.",
            "Among the other fine answers, you might also consider that owning a vehicle outright will free you from the requirement to carry insurance on the vehicle (you must still carry insurance on yourself in most states).",
            "I used to work for Ally Auto (formerly known as GMAC) and I'd advise not to pay off the account unless you need to free up some debt in your credit report since until the account is paid off it will show that you owe your financial institution the original loan amount. The reason why I am saying not to pay-off the account is because good/bad payments are sent to the credit bureau 30 days after the due date of the payment, and if you want to increase your credit score then its best to pay it on a monthly basis, the negative side to this is you will pay more interest by doing this.  If ever you decide to leave $1.00 in loan, I am pretty much sure that the financial institution will absorb the remaining balance and consider the account paid off.  What exactly is your goal here? Do you plan to increase your credit score? Do you need to free up some debt?"

        "question": "Pros / cons of being more involved with IRA investments [duplicate]",
        "answer": "The document outlines several advantages and disadvantages of being more involved with IRA investments in comparison to 401(k) plans. Here are some summarized pros and cons:\n\nPros of being more involved with IRA investments:\n- Broader investment choices: Unlike 401(k)s, which may have limited investment options, IRAs often offer a wider range of investment opportunities, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.\n- Lower fees: IRAs may offer access to investment options with lower fees. For example, you could find IRA providers offering index funds with fees around 0.1% as opposed to some employer 401(k) funds that charge over 1% per year.\n- Tax considerations: Depending on your tax bracket and the types of IRA you use (Traditional or Roth), you may benefit from tax deductions now or tax-free growth for the future.\n- Flexibility: With an IRA, you generally have more control over your investments and can adjust your strategy as needed.\n\nCons of being more involved with IRA investments:\n- Limited contributions: The annual limit for IRA contributions is lower than that for 401(k) contributions. For instance, in 2013, the maximum contribution for an IRA was $5,500, whereas it was $17,500 for a 401(k).\n- Complexity: Managing an IRA, especially if you also have a 401(k), can add complexity to your investment strategy and tax situation.\n- Income phaseouts: There are income phaseout ranges for IRA deductibility and Roth IRA eligibility, which add complexity to the decision-making process regarding where to invest.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it's essential to be aware of the full scope of one's financial situation, including considerations like employer matches for 401(k) plans, fees involved, investment options, and tax implications before deciding the extent to which one should be involved with IRA investments .",

They diversify and reduce stock-specific risk by moving from individual stocks to many stocks, but you can diversify even further by selecting different fund types (e.g. large-cal, small-cap, fixed- income (bond) funds, international, etc.).  Your target-date fund probably includes a few different types already, and will automatically reallocate to less risky investments as you get close to the target date. I would look at the fees of different types of funds, and compare them to the historical returns of those funds.  You can also use things like morningstar and other ratings as guides, but they are generally very large buckets and may not be much help distinguishing between individual funds. So to answer the question, yes you can diversify further - and probably get better returns (and lower fees) that a target-date fund.  The question is - is it worth your time and effort to do so?  You're obviously comfortable investing for the long-term, so you might get some benefit by spending a little time looking for different funds to increase your diversification.

            "From Wikipedia: A hard money loan is a specific type of asset-based loan financing through which a borrower receives funds secured by the value of a parcel of real estate. Hard money loans are typically issued at much higher interest rates than conventional commercial or residential property loans and are almost never issued by a commercial bank or other deposit institution. Hard money is similar to a bridge loan, which usually has similar criteria for lending as well as cost to the borrowers. The primary difference is that a bridge loan often refers to a commercial property or investment property that may be in transition and does not yet qualify for traditional financing, whereas hard money often refers to not only an asset-based loan with a high interest rate, but possibly a distressed financial situation, such as arrears on the existing mortgage, or where bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings are occurring. This implies to me that these loans are only against real estate.

The filings can be accessed through the SEC's EDGAR database.\n\n3. **Stock Exchanges:** Companies listed on stock exchanges are required to follow the exchange's rules for financial reporting. Reports are often made available through the exchange's website.\n\n4. **News Services and Financial Information Providers:** Companies may distribute their financial reports through news wire services, financial news websites, and financial information providers such as Bloomberg, Reuters, and others.\n\n5. **Printed Copies:** Some companies may still provide printed copies of their financial reports to shareholders upon request, although this practice is becoming less common with the increase in digital distribution.\n\n6. **Email Subscriptions:** Investors can often subscribe to email notifications to receive the latest financial reports and other news directly from the company.\n\n7. **Regulatory Bodies Outside the US:** For companies outside the United States, financial reports are filed with the relevant country's securities regulator or financial reporting authority, which may have an online system similar to the SEC's EDGAR.\n\nFinancial reports are important documents that reflect a company's financial health and performance.

        "answer": "The PEG ratio, which stands for the Price/Earnings to Growth ratio, is calculated as the Price/Earnings ratio divided by the Annual EPS (Earnings Per Share) Growth . It is a valuation metric that considers a stock's earnings growth rate in addition to its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The PEG ratio provides a more complete picture because it factors in the growth of earnings, which the P/E ratio alone does not account for.\n\nA PEG ratio lower than 1 may indicate that a stock is undervalued relative to its earnings growth and therefore could be considered a better buy with the prospect of going up in value. It is often cited that a PEG ratio between 1 to 2 is viewed as attractive by the standards set by famous investors Graham and Dodd .\n\nThe PEG ratio is useful for stock investing as it helps investors make more informed decisions by assessing the relative value of a stock considering both its current earnings and its expected growth rate. It is particularly helpful when comparing companies within the same industry, where growth rates can be a significant differentiator in future potential. However, it is essential to consider that the PEG ratio is just one of many tools, and its effectiveness can be influenced by the accuracy of the growth estimates and the context in which it is used.",

        "question": "Bucketing investments to track individual growths",
        "answer": "The uploaded file does not explicitly mention \"bucketing investments\" or provide details about tracking the growth of individual investments by bucketing them.\n\nHowever, some investment strategies mentioned in the file could be adapted into a bucketing strategy:\n\n1. Diversification into different asset classes: The document suggests at one point a 50-50 mix between the S&P 500 (large cap) and the Russell 2000 (small cap) for a certain age bracket . This can be seen as an elementary form of bucketing, where you allocate your assets into two different 'buckets' or investment categories.\n\n2. Risk adjustment over time: It\u2019s recommended to hold a higher percentage in stocks when younger (like small-cap and large-cap stock indexes), and as one gets older, to move progressively more investments into bonds to safeguard earnings . Different age-based 'buckets' can be created, with the investment mix growing more conservative as one ages.\n\n3. Rebalancing: The file briefly mentions quarterly rebalancing as a way to stay slightly ahead of the market with minimal effort . This could be incorporated into a bucketing strategy where you periodically assess and rebalance the assets in each bucket to maintain your preferred level of risk and investment composition.\n\n4. Tax efficiency: The document mentions the importance of considering investment expenses and opting for low-expense-ratio mutual funds. Index funds are mentioned as a good option due to typically lower expense ratios and the fact that most active managers don't beat the market . When bucketing, it may be valuable to consider the tax efficiency of investments, opting for low-cost funds within different buckets.\n\n5. Retirement accounts: Contributions to retirement accounts like a tax-deductible or Roth account could be a bucket focused on long-term growth that enjoys certain tax advantages .\n\nTo implement a bucketing strategy to track individual growth, you would categorize your investments into different 'buckets' based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Each bucket would have its own asset allocation and investment strategy. Regular monitoring and rebalancing would help ensure that each bucket stays aligned with its specific objectives, allowing you to track individual performance and growth over time.\n\nPlease note that the above suggestions are inferred from related concepts in the document and are not explicit instructions on bucketing investments. For a personalized investment strategy, including bucketing, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can take into account your individual circumstances and goals.",

        "answer": "The search results did not yield specific information on getting a \"rough\" home appraisal prior to starting the refinance process. It is common, however, to get an estimate of a home's value before refinancing.\n\nThere are several ways homeowners can get a rough appraisal of their home:\n\n1. Use Online Valuation Tools: Many real estate websites offer free tools to estimate home value based on public records and recent sales data.\n\n2. Comparative Market Analysis (CMA): A real estate agent can provide a CMA, which compares your home to similar properties that have sold recently in your area.\n\n3. Hire an Appraiser: For the most accurate estimate, you can hire a professional appraiser to assess the value of your home based on a detailed inspection and market data.\n\n4. Tax Assessment: You could also refer to your property tax statement for an assessed value, though this may not fully reflect your home's market value.\n\nIt's important to note that these methods will give you a ballpark figure, not an official appraisal, which is conducted by a licensed appraiser during the refinancing process.",

Even if a few turn you down, some will do it. You might say that an agent isn't going to be as accurate as an appraiser, and you are right. There is also an expectation that they will evaluate higher than the real value, to persuaade you to sell. That probably isn't a big issue, and it's something you can compensate for. And even an appraiser is going to be based somewhat on speculation.  You might try to do this calculation yourself, but an agent has access to the actual sale prices of nearby houses - you can't get that information. You only have access to the asking prices.

I hit the appraised price very close in my estimate, high or low compared to Zillow, but used transaction data from there.just my thought.  I chose a random neighborhood, and this was the first house I clicked. The main view shows last sale date, so I'd obviously suggest the OP look for more recent ones.

        "question": "Pay off credit cards in one lump sum, or spread over a few months?",
        "answer": "The document suggests that paying off credit cards in one lump sum is the better financial decision compared to spreading payments over a few months. One section specifically states that the idea that it's better for your credit score to pay down credit cards over time is a myth and emphasizes that paying them off and consolidating debt will save you money. This is because you'll avoid additional interest that would accrue during the period you're carrying the balance, even if you have the means to pay off the cards completely. Paying extra interest does not provide a financial benefit compared to the immediate return and long-term benefit of eliminating debt .\n\nAdditionally, the document points out that while it's good for your credit utilization to not exceed a third of your available credit, having a zero utilization on your credit cards can be a negative hit to your credit score. Therefore, it's suggested to use your cards for small purchases and pay off the full statement balance each month. This keeps your credit utilization above zero without accruing interest .\n\nIn conclusion, if you have the means to pay off your credit card debt in one lump sum, it is advisable to do so rather than spreading out the payments, which would result in paying more interest without any significant benefit to your credit score. After paying off your cards, you should then utilize them lightly to maintain a healthy credit utilization ratio and pay the statement balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.",

It is possible that the document does not contain that specific information or that it may not be easily accessible.\n\nHowever, generally speaking, the ROI for a share of stock can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROI} = \\frac{\\text{Total Return} - \\text{Cost of Investment}}{\\text{Cost of Investment}} \\times 100% \\]\n\nTo elaborate on the components involved:\n\n- **Total Return** is the sum of any dividends received plus the difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the stock.\n- **Cost of Investment** refers to the total amount initially invested in the stock, including purchase price and any commissions or fees paid.\n\nFor example, if you purchased a stock for $100, paid a $5 brokerage fee, and later sold it for $150 while receiving $10 in dividends, the calculation would be:\n\nTotal Return = ($150 - $100) + $10 = $60\nCost of Investment = $100 + $5 = $105\n\n\\[ \\text{ROI} = \\frac{$60 - $105}{$105} \\times 100% \\approx -42.86% \\]\n\nThis is a simplified calculation, and in a real-world scenario, you would also need to account for taxes, multiple transactions, and other potential costs.

        "answer": "When deciding between paying off the principal of a home versus investing in a mutual fund, it's essential to consider both the potential rate of return and your personal risk tolerance.\n\nPaying off your home mortgage is typically a low-risk, low-reward strategy since you are effectively guaranteed a return equal to your mortgage interest rate by reducing interest expenses. For example, if your mortgage interest rate is 4.3%, you are essentially earning a 4.3% return on any extra payments made towards the mortgage principal .\n\nIn contrast, investing in a mutual fund, particularly one that primarily invests in stocks, is a high-risk, high-reward choice. While there's a decent chance that you could earn a better return than the 4% threshold in the long run, this involves taking on more risk, and the returns are not guaranteed .\n\nOne approach to consider is maximizing your retirement accounts first, building an adequate emergency fund, and then focusing on your mortgage as a part of your investment strategy, assuming that by paying it off, your cash flow will significantly increase in the future .\n\nIt's also suggested to compare the liquidity of the investment choices. Money invested in mutual funds generally has higher liquidity compared to home equity, which might be critical depending on your financial goals and need for accessible funds .\n\nFinally, it's important to recognize that the mathematically correct answer isn't always the best for every individual. Owning your home outright can provide a psychological benefit and freedom, potentially opening up opportunities that might not be as readily available if you still have a significant mortgage burden .\n\nThe decision ultimately depends on your personal circumstances, including your job security, risk tolerance, future goals, and the current state of your finances. It is often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to help you assess your situation and make the best choice for your specific needs.",

Money invested in a mutual fund (exclusive of retirement accounts with early withdrawal penalties) has a relatively high liquidity.

To put it simply: If you get in a desperate situation (long term unemployment) it is better to have to cash in a mutual fund than try to sell your house on the quick and move in with your mother. Liquidity becomes less of an issue if you also manage to fund a decent sized rainy-day fund (6-9 months of living expenses).",

And yet, the question remains. The stock market, as measured by the S&P has returned 9.67%  compounded over the last 100 years. But with a standard deviation just under 20%, there are years when you'll do better and years you'll lose. And I'd not ignore the last decade which was pretty bad, a loss for the decade.  There are clearly two schools of thought. One says that no one ever lost sleep over not having a mortgage payment. The other school states that at the very beginning, you have a long investing horizon, and the chances are very good that the 30 years to come will bring a return north of 6%. The two decades prior to the last were so good that these past 30 years were still pretty good, 11.39% compounded.  There is no right or wrong here. My gut says fund your retirement accounts to the maximum. Build your emergency fund. You see, if you pay down your mortgage, but lose your job, you'll still need to make those payments. Once you build your security, think of the mortgage as the cash side of your investing, i.e. focus less on the relatively low rate of return (4.3%) and more on the eventual result, once paid, your cash flow goes up nicely.

        "question": "Can I get a discount on merchandise by paying with cash instead of credit?",
        "answer": "Merchants may offer cash discounts for a couple of reasons. One is that they don't have to pay interchange fees on cash payments or pay much lower fees on no-reward debit cards. The other reason, which is less frequently discussed but commonly known among smaller merchants, is that cash payments can help them reduce their tax liability by failing to declare the sale or declaring a smaller portion of the sale to the authorities. However, it is important to note that larger stores may not take such risks, but smaller, owner-operated stores often will. For products like TVs, cash discounts might be more applicable due to these reasons, whereas for cars, the situation can be different since car salesmen earn a substantial amount from offering financing, and cars must be registered with the state, creating alternative records of sales .\n\nFor specific merchandise, it seems that big box stores like Best Buy are not inclined to offer discounts for cash, but small privately owned shops may do so. Meanwhile, cash has been effective at securing discounts when buying from individuals like on Craigslist, garage sales, estate sales, flea markets, etc. The document suggests that using cash can be effective in negotiating for products such as well-loved cars from individuals or used dealers and mentions an example where a vendor offered a 5% discount for upfront cash payment for carpet .\n\nPlease note that the information provided is general and the feasibility of obtaining cash discounts may vary based on the type of merchandise, the seller, and the specific circumstances of the purchase.

One is that they will not have to pay interchange fees on cash (or pay much lower fees on no-reward debit cards).  Gas stations in my home state of NJ already universally offer different cash and credit prices.  Costco will not even take Visa and MasterCard credit cards (debit only) for this reason. The second reason, not often talked about but widely known amongst smaller merchants, is that they can fail to declare the sale (or claim a smaller portion of the sale) to the authorities in order to reduce their tax liability.  Obviously the larger stores will not risk their jobs for this, but smaller owner-operated (\"\"mom and pop\"\") stores often will.  This applies to both reduced sales tax liability and income tax liability.  This used to be more limited per sale (but more widespread overall), since tax authorities would look closely for a mismatch between declared income and spending, but with an ever-larger proportion of customers paying by credit card, merchants can take a bigger chunk of their cash sales off the books without drawing too much suspicion. Both of the above are more applicable to TVs than cars, since (1) car salesmen make substantial money from offering financing and (2) all cars must be registered with the state, so alternative records of sales abound.  Also, car prices tend to be at or near the credit limit of most cards, so it is not as common to pay for them in this way.\"",

I'd call ahead of time and notify them that I'd be paying in cash.  I got ridiculous discounts, sometimes even less than the copay.  I do not know why this discrepancy exists and I didn't want to ask for fear of messing up a good thing."

        "question": "Interest charges on balance transfer when purchases are involved",
        "answer": "When you transfer a balance to a credit card with a 0% introductory rate on balance transfers, you won't pay interest on the transferred amount as long as the promotional terms are met. However, if you make new purchases with the same credit card, the interest treatment for your transactions can change.\n\nThe concept known as the \"Grace Period\" comes into play here. Normally, if you pay off your entire balance by the due date, you won't have to pay interest on new purchases because of the grace period. However, if you don't pay your balance in full, the grace period ends, and you'll have to pay interest on the amount you spent on new purchases from the day the purchase was made. That means if there is still a balance remaining from the previous statement, any new purchase will accrue interest immediately when the next statement is issued, and this will continue until you pay off the entire balance and wait for the next cycle to restore the grace period .\n\nFor example, if someone named Sally charges $1,500 in purchases on the first day of her billing cycle and pays off that entire $1,500 by the due date, wiping her balance to zero, then her purchases during the second month will be free of interest. However, if Sally leaves just $1 of her balance unpaid from the first month, that $1 begins to accrue interest immediately from the start of the billing cycle, and so will her new purchases. This can result in finance charges accruing day by day, which can add up over time .\n\nIn essence, as long as you are carrying a balance transfer on that promotional rate, it's usually wise to avoid using the card for new purchases if you wish to avoid interest charges on those purchases. If you need to use a credit card, consider using a different card for new purchases that you can pay off in full to benefit from the grace period and avoid accruing interest.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of your credit card agreement and understand how the interest is applied to balance transfers and new purchases to manage your debts effectively.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Its called a \"\"Grace Period\"\" and you are not paying interest on the 0% BT, you are paying interest on the amount you spent in purchases If you do not pay your balance in full by the due date your grace period ends. This means that you have to pay interest on the purchased amount from the day it is made. This is why when you do a balance transfer the card should be put in the Sock Drawer until the BT is paid off. In order to restore the grace period you must pay the balance in full and the grace period will start during the Next Payment Cycle. Lets Assume: Statement cuts on the 1st and Due date is the 20th. you make the minimum payment of $10 Balance now is $100 Since you have a balance of $100 from the previous statement and a new purchase of $50.00, when the next statement cuts you will have to pay interest according to the terms on the $50.00 portion. In order to get the grace period back you will have to pay in full and wait for the next cycle In case I did not explain it well here is a quote from creditcards dot com website: The cost of carrying a balance   This is because carrying a balance of   any size into the next billing cycle means there is no grace period on   your purchases during that cycle. The card company will begin charging   interest on your purchases the day you make them. So leaving even $1   in unpaid balance on your card will cost you considerably more than   the measly finance charges on that dollar. To see how this works let's consider an imaginary card user named   Sally. She's so happy she got a new credit card that she charges   $1,500 in purchases on the first day of her monthly billing cycle.   After the cycle ends, Sally pays off the entire $1,500 by the due   date, wiping her balance to zero. As a result, her purchases during   the second month are also free of interest. She has used her grace   period wisely to avoid finance charges. What happens if Sally leaves just $1 of her balance from the first   month unpaid? That $1 begins to accrue interest starting the first day   of the billing cycle. It's just $1, so the interest is not a big deal   -- but because she used up her grace period without paying off her entire debt, her new purchases during the second month also start to   get hit with interest charges immediately, starting the day of the   transaction. Assuming she makes another $1,500 in purchases at the   average annual interest rate of about 13 percent, that means $16 in   finance charges for the month. If Sally repeats this pattern, the   interest costs add up to $190 over the course of a year.\"",

        "question": "Fees aside, what factors could account for performance differences between U.S. large-cap index ETFs?",
        "answer": "Factors that could account for performance differences between U.S. large-cap index ETFs, aside from fees, include:\n\n1. Tracking error: This refers to a discrepancy between the ETF performance and the performance of the index it is tracking. Reasons for tracking errors can be attributed to fund management decisions, the timing of reconstitutions, or the replication method (full replication vs. optimization) .\n\n2. Demand and Supply: ETFs are traded on exchanges, much like stocks, which means their prices can be influenced by market sentiment. If many investors want to buy into an ETF because they believe the underlying index will rise, the ETF's price may increase, and vice versa. This can cause deviations from the net asset value (NAV) of the ETFs' holdings .\n\n3. Liquidity: The trading volume of an ETF can impact bid-ask spreads and the liquidity of the ETF. Large, heavily traded ETFs generally have smaller spreads and greater liquidity, which can be an advantage for investors who trade frequently or require flexibility in entering or exiting positions .\n\n4. Fund Structure: The fund structure and rules set for fund composition can affect performance. The specific rules regarding when and how stocks are added or removed from the ETF can have a consequential impact on performance .\n\n5. Securities Lending: Some ETFs lend out securities to earn additional income, which can slightly boost performance. The degree to which this strategy is utilized can vary among ETFs and can be an influencing factor.\n\n6. Dividend Treatment: The way an ETF handles dividends\u2014whether they are reinvested or distributed\u2014can affect the compounding effect on returns. ETFs that automatically reinvest dividends might have a slight performance edge over time.\n\n7. Tax Efficiency: The creation/redemption process of ETF shares can be more tax-efficient than mutual funds, potentially leading to better after-tax performance for ETF investors.\n\n8. Market Conditions: An ETF's sector or thematic exposure can lead to performance variations, especially if the index it tracks is sensitive to certain market conditions, economic cycles, or geopolitical events.\n\nWhile some factors, such as expense ratios, are easily measurable, others like tracking error and liquidity require more careful analysis for investors considering different ETF options. It's important for investors to examine these factors closely when comparing ETFs tracking the same index.",

If you run up a high utilization, such as 80%, and then pay it back down to 10%, your credit score in the later month will reflect the lower ratio without any memory of the higher utilization from the previous month. This suggests that exceeding the 30% rule of thumb, even significantly, will not permanently harm your credit if you pay it down before the promotional period ends. However, it's important to manage your spending responsibly and within your budget, regardless of the 0% APR offer .\n\nIt is also mentioned that one should not plan finances around the credit score but should stick to a budget and use credit responsibly. The document advises that you shouldn't allow teaser rates to tempt you into making purchases that you wouldn't otherwise make and to always read the fine print in the credit agreement for potential pitfalls .\n\nAdditionally, while going over the 20% level of utilization might result in a minor hit to your credit score, it's not expected to be a significant impact depending on how high the utilization goes, and it shouldn\u2019t cause too much concern .",

Do all of these things, and your credit rating will take care of itself.  Don't try to plan your finances around raising it. On the subject of 0% financing specifically, my rule of thumb is to only ever use it when I have enough money saved up to buy the thing outright, and even then only if my budget will still balance with the added cost of repaying the loan.  Other people have other rules, including not taking such loans at all, and you should develop a rule that works for you (but you should have a rule).  One rule shouldn't have is \"\"do whatever will optimize your credit score\"\" because you shouldn't plan your finances around your credit score.   All things considered, I think the most important thing in your situation is to make sure that you don't let the teaser rate tempt you into making purchases you wouldn't otherwise make.  You're not really getting free money; you're just shifting around the time frame for payment, and only within a limited window at that.  Also, be sure to read the fine print in the credit agreement; they can be filled with gotchas and pitfalls.

        "answer": "Investing in a private company usually involves purchasing shares of the company directly from the company itself or from existing shareholders. These transactions do not occur on public stock exchanges and often require more substantial minimum investments compared to purchasing publicly traded stocks. The detailed process can vary based on the company's structure and investor requirements, but generally, investments in private companies are less liquid and carry a different risk profile than those in public companies.\n\nMoreover, when a company is dissolved, any leftover assets become \"bona vacantia,\" meaning they pass to the Crown, and the company's bank accounts get frozen. This is only related to a company's closure and is not a direct explanation of how investments work, but it does outline legal considerations in the context of a company's lifecycle .\n\nFor more specific information on investing in private companies, I would need to look further into the documents provided to see if there is detailed information on this topic.

There is nothing objective (like a piece of paper) that states the company is worth 400K. It is all about perceived value. Some investors may think it is worth something because of some knowledge they may have. Heck, the company could be worth nothing but the investor could have some sentimental value associated to it. So is it actually the case that E's company is worth 400k only AFTER the transaction? It is worth what someone pays for it when they pay for it. I repeat- the 400K valuation is subjective. In return the investor is getting 25% ownership of the product or company. The idea is that when someone has ownership, they have a vested interest in it being successful. In that case, the investor will do whatever he/she can to improve the chances of success (in addition to supplying the 100K capital). For instance, the investor will leverage their network or perhaps put more money into it in the future. Is the 100k added to the balance sheet as cash? Perhaps. It is an asset that may later be used to fund inventory (for instance). ... and would the other 300k be listed as an IP asset? No. See what I said about the valuation just being perception.

The total value of the shares may include intangible assets of course but part of the point is that the company is doing an \"\"equity financing\"\" where the company continues to operate. The shareholders of the company have their stake which may be rewarded when the company is acquired or starts paying dividends but that is a call for the management of the company to make. While there is a cash infusion into the company, usually there is more being done as the Dragon or Shark can also bring contacts and expertise to the company to help it grow. If the investor provides the entrepreneur with introductions or offers suggestions on corporate strategy this is more than just buying shares in the company.

        "question": "Why can't house prices be out of tune with salaries",
        "answer": "House prices can't indefinitely be out of tune with salaries due to several interconnected economic and market dynamics. Here are some reasons:\n\n1. **Affordability and Home Equity**: If house prices grow out of proportion to salaries, homeownership becomes increasingly unaffordable. Since home equity is only realized when a house is sold, it doesn't translate to real wealth if homeowners are buried in mortgage debt that outpaces their income. If debt is accumulated through home equity loans, it poses a risk of default should the house's value decline, and such debt must be serviced by income, not equity .\n\n2. **Market Sustainability**: The housing market fundamentally requires a steady influx of buyers to maintain property values. If first-time buyers can't afford homes due to a massive gap between house prices and incomes, existing homeowners can't sell to upgrade, which can trigger a market slump. Prices can only be sustained if there's a broad base of people who can afford to buy .\n\n3. **Long-term Economic Impact**: Over the long term, assuming house prices rise faster than salaries, the average house cost would become implausibly high compared to average salaries. This discrepancy is economically unsustainable as it implies a shrinking pool of eligible buyers and contravenes the principles of supply and demand .\n\n4. **Housing Market Corrections**: History shows that periods during which house prices significantly outpace salaries are often followed by market corrections. During the housing bubble of 2007, for example, inflated home values eventually led to a market crash as the cycle of buying and selling broke due to prices exceeding what people could afford .\n\n5. **Housing Budget Constraints**: Housing is a basic need and traditionally should only account for a certain percentage of disposable income. This budget constraint naturally limits how much house prices can rise relative to salaries. If housing costs become too large a portion of someone's budget, it leaves too little for other expenses, creating economic strain and reducing market demand for expensive homes .\n\nIn summary, the sustainability of house prices is directly tethered to the capacity of potential homeowners to afford them, which is linked to income levels. While various factors can drive prices and incomes independently in the short term, such as local demand, availability of credit, and investment from foreign buyers, the long-term health of the housing market requires a balance between property values and average salaries .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Your friends are overlooking a couple of problems with house prices and salaries being out of whack: Home 'equity' is a paper gain unless you realize it by selling the house. If you don't, but use the 'home ATM', all you're doing is piling up more debt that's secured on an asset that has downside risk. Ask anybody who's refinanced their house to buy a new boat or SUV in 2006/2007. In other words you're remortgaging the chickens before the eggs hatched. Of course they're also forgetting that all this debt will have to be paid back at some point, and that usually takes income, not equity. In a certain sense the housing market is a pyramid scheme that requires an influx of new buyers to maintain prices. Very simply, if you can't sell your house to buy a bigger one because the first time buyer you're trying to sell it to can't afford the down payment or the payment on the mortgage, then you can't sell your house to buy a bigger/better/nicer one and the next person in the chain can't sell his/hers. Cue the domino effect. House prices are only sustainable if people actually can afford to buy houses and if there's a massive disconnect between house prices and salaries, then house prices will fall eventually. It might just take a little longer depending on the amount of creative financing options that will eventually dry up.",

The amount of housing out there requires that a large market of consumers is available to purchase them. If housing prices rose infinitely ahead of salaries, the market for potential buyers would continue to shrink until supply would outstrip demand. And then we have the wonderful housing bubble like the one that we just went through (or in some places like China, have the potential to go through). Short version: It violates the relationship between supply and demand.",
            "Here's another way to think about.  Let's assume it is 2011 and we have a married couple who are 25 and make a combined salary of $50,000/yr net.  A suitable first house in their area is $300,000, six times their annual net salary.  Assuming they could scrimp so that 1/2 of take-home went toward saving for their home, they could save enough to buy the house using cash in 12 years, at the age of 37.  Onerous, but they could do it. But now let's allow salaries to increase by 3% a year and homes at 10%/yr, as in your question, and let's run things out for 20 years. Now a 25 year old couple at the same sort of jobs would be making $87,675/yr.  But the houses in that town would be worth not $300k but $1,834,772.  Instead of six times their salary, a house is now nearly 21 times their salary.  This means that if they saved 1/2 of take-home to save up for a house, they could afford to buy the house using cash when they were 67 years old. It gets worse quickly.  If you run it out for just ten more years, to 30 years, a couple would be able to buy the house -- at $4.8 million or 40x a year's salary -- in cash when they were 105 years old.  (Let's hope they ate brown rice). Mortgages can't save them, since even if they could put down ten years' worth of savings on the 2041 house (that'd be 14% down), they'd still carry a $4.1 million mortgage with a $118k annual net salary.",
            "They can't keep rising with respect to people's income because eventually you run out of buyers. If there's roughly one house for every five people, then you'd better make sure that the price you set to sell your house is affordable to people in the upper fifth of income scales, or else you are mathematically guaranteed not to have any customers. Now, it's true that the price of particular houses can get much higher, but they tended to be higher in the first place. Housing isn't exactly an efficient market, but for the most part you have to pay for the house that you get, or else someone else will outbid you. An individual area might, temporarily, buck these trends because it suddenly becomes popular and there are a lot of extra buyers putting money on the table. In the long run, someone is going to build for those buyers, even if it means moving up the chain from enormous rural lots to suburban single-family homes to low-density garden apartments to residential towers.",
            "\"The three basic needs are food, clothing, and shelter. Housing falls into the third category. Because it is \"\"basic,\"\" housing takes up a large part of one's disposable income. The rule of thumb is that you shouldn't spend more than 25% of your income on rent or mortgages. And that is income BEFORE taxes. Anything much more than that takes up too much of one's budget. You simply CAN'T double housing's share of the budget from 25% to 50%. Whereas, it's easy to go from 1% to 2% for say, a cellphone upgrade. In the long run, housing prices are constrained by the size of people's housing budgets, which in turn are tied to incomes. Nowadays, that includes FOREIGN buyers. So there may be a case where west coast housing prices are driven up by Asian buyers, or Florida housing by buyers from Latin America, driving Americans out of local markets.\"",
            "The big problem with your argument is the 10% per year figure, because in the long term (especially if adjusted for inflation) the prices have not been going up nearly that fast. Here is a site with some nice graphs for prices over the last 40 years, and it's pretty clear to see that pretty much just what you were talking about happened, prices outpaced the ability of people to pay, which progressively locked out more and more first time buyers, and eventually that breaks the cycle, pops the bubble, and the prices adjust. There is always of course the choice to NOT buy a house, and just rent, or if you had the feeling that you are near the top of a bubble, SELL and go back to renting.  It's interesting to note that in general, rental rates did not increase at nearly the same pace as the prices in the recent bubble. (which of course made it harder for anyone who bought 'investment' properties in the recent 8 years or so to cover their payments via rental revenue.)",
            "There's a few things going on here. If we fixed rates (and terms) over time we'd expect a pretty tight chart of home prices to income, almost lockstep. Add a layer of growth above that in boom times due to the wealth effect (when stocks are way up, we have extra money to blow on bigger houses) and the opposite when markets are down. Next, the effect of rates. With long term rates dropping from 14% in 1985 to 5% in 2003, the amount that can be bought for the same monthly payment rises dramatically as rates fall. Easy to lose site of that and the fact that the average size house has increased about 1.5% per year over the last 40 years, surely that can't continue.  When you normalize all these factors, houses cost fewer hours-worked almost at the peak of the market than 25 years ago. Mike's logical example of extrapolating out is very clever, I like it. In the short term, we'll see periods that are booms and busts, but actual prices will straddle the line representing the borrowing power of a week's pay.",

        "question": "How to calculate ownership for property with a partner",
        "answer": "When calculating ownership for property with a partner, there are several approaches you can consider:\n\n1. Equal Payments: If both parties are paying equally towards the mortgage, one method would be to reimburse each party for their contributions in the event of a sale (e.g., you getting back \u00a331,000 and your partner \u00a34,242) and then splitting any remaining proceeds 50-50. If there is a loss, the debt would also be split 50-50 .\n\n2. Proportional Investment: Alternatively, you could divide any profits from the sale of the property in proportion to your individual investments (for example, 51.6% to you and 48.4% to your partner if that represents your contribution ratio) assuming equal contribution to the loans .\n\n3. Landlord/Tenant Relationship: Another recommendation is to establish a landlord/tenant dynamic, where one partner has 100% ownership, and the other acts as a tenant. This approach simplifies matters, as you could decide on a rental amount and one becomes the landlord, and the other the tenant. In the event of a relationship ending, if both names are on the financing, selling the property or refinancing under one name is suggested to settle any debts and determine the equity or debt remaining .\n\n4. Legal Advice: It's advisable to consult with a conveyancing solicitor who can provide details on these arrangements. It is crucial to have a written agreement that outlines the terms agreed upon by both partners, including any exit strategies for selling the property or buyout options .\n\nRemember, whatever method you choose should be fair and acceptable to both parties, and it's very important to document your agreement in a legally binding way to avoid complications later. A lawyer can put all the details of the partnership in a formal agreement, which can provide clarity about expectations, responsibilities, and a strategy for exit if necessary .",

            "I can't quite follow your question, so I'm proceeding under the following assumptions: - You paid \u00a331,000 - Your partner paid \u00a34,242 - You have at least one mortgage, which you both pay equally. If the relationship terminates, sell the property. You are reimbursed \u00a331,000 and your partner is reimbursed \u00a34,242. Any remaining proceeds from the sale are split 50-50. If the result is a net loss (i.e. you are underwater on your mortgage), you split the debt 50-50. If you are not both paying the same toward the mortgage, I'd split the profit or loss according to how much you each pay toward the mortgage. Of course, this is not the only possible way you can split things up. You can use pretty much any way you both think is fair. For example, maybe you should get more benefits from a profit because you contributed more up-front. The key thing, though, is that you must both agree in writing, in advance. This is reasonable; this is what I did, for example. Note that if the relationship ends, one or the other of you may wish to keep the property. I'd suggest including a clause in your written agreement simply disallowing this; specify criteria to force a sale. But I know lots of people are happy to allow this. They treat that situation as a forced sale from both people to one person. For example, if your partner chooses to stay in the house, he or she must buy the property from you at prevailing market rates.",
            "To add to ChrisInEdmonton's answer: Your conveyancing solicitor should be able to advise on the details, but a typical arrangement involves: As an alternative to the numbers in Chris' answer, it could be argued that you should first be reimbursed for the fees you paid (accounting for inflation), but that any remaining profits from the property itself should be divided in proportion to your individual investments (so 51.6% to you, and 48.4% to your partner, assuming you contribute to the loans equally).",
            "i would recommend that you establish a landlord/tenant relationship instead of joint ownership (ie 100% ownership stake for one of you vs 0% for the other). it is much cleaner and simpler.  basically, one of you can propose a monthly rent amount and the other one can chose to be either renter or landlord. alternatively, you can both write down a secret rental price offer assuming you are the landlord, then pick the landlord who wrote down the smaller rental price.  if neither of you can afford the down payment, then you can consider the renter's contribution an unsecured loan (at an agreed interest rate and payment schedule). if you must have both names on the financing, then i would recommend you sell the property (or refinance under a single name) as quickly as possible when the relationship ends (if not before), pay the renter back any remaining balance on the loan and leave the landlord with the resulting equity (or debt).  in any case, if you expect the unsecured loan to outlive your relationship, then you are either buying a house you can't afford, or partnering on it with someone you shouldn't."

        "question": "Is it a good investment for a foreigner to purchase a flat/apartment in China?",
        "answer": "Based on the information retrieved, purchasing an apartment in China as a foreigner may not be a good investment. The key considerations highlighted include:\n\n1. Property rights protection in China can be questionable, as there have been instances where the government has not shown much respect for the property rights of its own citizens .\n   \n2. China might currently be experiencing a residential housing bubble, which suggests that it may not be an ideal time to invest in real estate there . \n\n3. Foreign ownership of real estate in China involves additional complexities and risks, including expensive transaction costs, currency exchange risks, and the potential risk of government seizures of foreign investments .\n\n4. Financing such a purchase may be challenging since US banks are generally reluctant to lend for property purchases in China, and Chinese banks may not be eager to extend loans to foreigners .\n\n5. Practical considerations such as living in China, having clients ready to rent from you, and understanding local market conditions including the specific city, district, community, school district, and age of the building are necessary before making an investment  .\n\n6. Finally, it is important to note that when buying an apartment in mainland China, you do not own the land on which the property is built; the land is always state-owned, and essentially, you are renting it .\n\nGiven these considerations, it appears that investing in a flat or apartment in China may be a risky and challenging proposition for a foreign investor.",

            "I think a greater problem would be the protection of your property right.  China hasn't shown much respect for the property rights of its own citizens - moving people off subsistence farms in order to build high-rise apartments - so I'm not certain that a foreigner could expect much protection.  A first consideration in any asset purchase should always be consideration of the strength of local property law.  By all accounts, China fails.",
            "China is in the middle of a residential housing bubble, and now is probably a horrible time to invest in real estate in China.  Even if China wasn't near the peak of its bubble it would probably still be a bad idea because owning real estate in a foreign country is expensive and risky. There are real currency risks, think what would happen if the yuan declined significantly against the dollar. There is also the risk of the government seizing foreign held investments (not extremely likely but plausible). Another consideration is that it would be next to impossible for you to get a loan to purchase a property US banks wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft pole and I doubt Chinese banks would be very interested in lending to foreigners.",

You say investment, are you looking to live in it or rent it out?  I have nothing against China, but I'd not buy anywhere unless the price, location, and timing all were right.",
            "It is a lousy investment to purchase an apartment in China. Chinese citizens purchase apartments in China because, well... here's how China works: There's some fundamentals driving Chinese property values higher, but mostly it's a bubble caused by those reasons.",
            "More infomation is needed for any meaningful discussion about this.  I just assume you want to buy in China mainland, not Hongkong or other places. That depends on where you want to buy the flat.  Which city, which district of the city, which community, which school district, how old is the building?  Furthermore, always bearing in mind that you don't own the land when you buy a flat in China mainland.  The land is always state-owned, you are renting the land. Someone will say that the real property market in China is always in a bubble, but because the ownership of the land is different from countries like US and other things like one-child policy, things are not that easy to tell.   But if you don't live in China now and you don't have clients ready to rent from you, I don't think it is a good choice right now to buy one just for investment."

        "question": "Why would anyone want to pay off their debts in a way other than \u201chighest interest\u201d first?",
        "answer": "There are several reasons why someone might choose a debt repayment strategy other than the \"highest interest rate first\" method. Here are a few alternative approaches and their justifications:\n\n1. **Snowball Method**: This approach involves paying off debts from the smallest balance to the largest, regardless of the interest rate. The idea here is to create psychological wins that can motivate the person to keep paying off debt. As each smaller debt is cleared, the individual may feel a sense of accomplishment, which can be important for staying on track.\n\n2. **Snowflake Method**: Like the snowball method, the snowflake method also aims for psychological wins, but it does so by applying any small savings or unexpected income to the debt frequently, without waiting for large amounts to accumulate.\n\n3. **Balance Transfer**: Some might opt for consolidating high-interest debts onto a lower-interest credit card or loan. This can sometimes result in lower overall payments even if the initial strategy is not to attack the highest interest debt first.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Considerations**: If cash flow is a concern, paying off a debt that has a significant monthly payment but not necessarily the highest interest rate might be prioritized to free up monthly income.\n\n5. **Strategic Debt Payoff**: Sometimes, people might prioritize paying off a certain debt for strategic reasons, such as before applying for a mortgage, or if the debt is owed to a family member or a small business that they wish to support.\n\n6. **Psychological or Emotional Reasons**: There may be a particular debt that causes significant stress or has emotional baggage associated with it. Paying off this debt first can provide peace of mind, even if it's not the most financially optimal strategy.\n\n7. **Terms and Conditions of Debts**: Some debts might have terms that are less favorable, like a potential for a rate increase or penalties that might make it more appealing to pay those off first.\n\n8. **Avoiding PMI**: If someone is close to having enough equity in their home to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI), they might prioritize paying down their mortgage to the needed threshold instead of targeting higher-interest debts.\n\nEach of these strategies has its pros and cons, and what might be best for one person could be different for another based on their financial situation, psychological disposition, and personal goals. It's often advisable to speak with a financial advisor to plan the most effective debt repayment strategy for an individual's specific circumstances.",

            "\"It is true that all else being equal, you will pay a lower amount of total interest by paying down your highest interest rate debts first.  However, all else is not always equal.  I'm going to try to come up with some reasons why it might be better in some circumstances to pay your debts in a different order.  And I'll try to use as much math as possible.  :) Let's say that your goal is to eliminate all of your debt as fast as possible.  The faster you do this, the lower the total interest that you will pay.  Now, let's consider the different methods that you could take to get there: You could pay the highest interest first, you could pay the lowest interest first, or you could pay something in the middle first.  No matter which path you choose, the quicker you pay everything off, the lower total interest you will pay.  In addition to that, the quicker you pay everything off, the difference in total interest paid between the most optimal method and the least optimal method will be less.  To put this in mathematical notation: limt\u21920 \u0394 Interest(t) = 0 Given that, anything we can do to speed up the time it takes to get to \"\"debt free\"\" is to our advantage. When paying large amounts of debt as fast as possible, sacrifice is needed.  And this means that psychology comes into play.  I don't know about you, but for me, gamifying the system makes everything easier.  (After all, gamification is what gets us to write answers here on SE.) One way to do this is to eliminate individual debts as quickly as possible.  For example, let's say that I've got 10 debts.  5 of them are for $1k each.  3 of them are for $5k each, 1 is a $20k car loan, and 1 is a $100k mortgage.  Each one has a monthly payment. Let's say that I've got $3k sitting in the bank that I want to use to kickstart my debt reduction.  I could pay all $3k toward one of my larger loans, or I could immediately pay off 3 of my 10 loans.  Ignore interest for the moment, and let's say that we are going to pay off the smallest loans first.  When I eliminate these three loans, three of my monthly payments are also gone.  Now let's say that with the money I was paying toward these eliminated debts, and some other money I was able to scrape together $500 a month that I want to use toward debt reduction.  In four months, I've eliminated the last two $1k debts, and I'm down to 5 debts instead of 10.  Achievement Unlocked! Instead of this strategy, I could have paid toward my largest interest rate.  Let's say that was one of the $5k loans.  I paid the $3k toward the bank to it, and because I still had all the monthly payments after that, I was only able to scrape together $400 a month extra toward debt reduction.  In four months, I still have 10 debts. Now let's say that after these four months, I have a bad month, and some unexpected expenses come up.  If I've eliminated 5 of my debts, my monthly payments are less, and I'll have an easier month then I would have had if I still had 10 monthly payments to deal with. Each time I eliminate a debt, the amount extra I have each month to tackle the remaining debts gets bigger.  And if your goal is eliminating debt quickly, these early wins can really help motivate you on.  It really feels like you are getting somewhere when your monthly bills go down.  It also helps you with the debt free mindset.  You start to see a future where you aren't sending payments to the banks each month.  This method of paying your smaller debts first has been popularized in recent years by Dave Ramsey, and he calls it the debt snowball method. There might be other reasons why you would pick one debt over another to pay first.  For example, let's say that one of your loans is with a bank that has terrible customer service.  They don't send you bills on time, they process your payment late, their website stinks, they are a constant source of stress, and you are getting sick of them.  That would be a great reason to pay that debt first, and never set foot in that bank again. In conclusion: If you have a constant amount of extra cash each month that you are going to use to reduce your debt, and this will never change, then, yes, you will save money over the long run by paying the highest interest debt first.  However, if you are trying to eliminate your debt as fast as possible, and you are sacrificing in your budget, sending every extra penny you can scrape together toward debt reduction, the \"\"snowball\"\" method of knocking out the small debts first can help motivate you to continue to sacrifice toward your goal, and can also ease the cash flow situation in difficult months when you find yourself with less extra to send in.\"",
            "\"Very good Ben, in a more simplistic form:  If debt was about math only, we would not have payday lenders, 21% + credit cards, or sub-prime car loans.  Yet these things are prevalent. Debt reduction is often about behavior modification.  As such small wins are necessary to keep going much like a 12 step program; or, gamification as Ben pointed out.   The funny thing is that if a person becomes and stays intense on a debt reduction program, interest rate \"\"inefficiency\"\" is dwarfed by extra income or increased austerity.\"",
            "\"In some cases, it might be rational to pay low-interest debt first, because the consequences of defaulting on that debt are worse.   Consider this simplified example.  Suppose you have two debts: a low-interest mortgage, secured by your house, and a high-interest unsecured credit card debt, both of which are within a few years of being paid off.  There is a chance that sometime between now and then, something will happen to disrupt your income (e.g. medical problems), and it won't be possible to make the payments on either loan.   Defaulting on the credit card loan will result in a lower credit score and calls from collection agencies.  Defaulting on the mortgage will result in the foreclosure or forced sale of your house, at best forcing you to move, and at worst leaving you homeless, at a time when you are also facing other (e.g. medical) problems.  So you might rationally judge that losing your house is much worse than bad credit.  Therefore, you might rationally conclude that it would be better to direct extra income toward paying down the mortgage, to increase the chances that, if and when an income disruption might occur, the mortgage would already be paid off.  In other words, you shorten the window of time where income disruption results in foreclosure. You might decide that this increased security is worth the extra interest you will pay, compared to the strategy where you pay the high-interest loan first. This is a fairly special situation, but you asked \"\"Why might it be a good idea to do this?\"\", and I am just giving an example where it could rationally be considered a good idea.   (Of course, in a real-life version of this example, there might be other options available, such as refinancing the mortgage.  If you like, you could imagine a more extreme example where the lower-interest debt is owed to Joey Knuckles the loanshark, who will come and break your kneecaps if you miss a payment.)\"",
            "TL/DR  Yes, The David popularized the Debt Snowball. The method of paying low balance first.  It's purely psychological. The reward or sense of accomplishment is a motivator to keep pushing to the next card.  There's also the good feeling of following one you believe to be wise. The David is very charismatic, and speaks in a no-nonsense my way or the highway voice. History is riddled with religious leaders who offer advice which is followed without question.  The good feeling, in theory, leads to a greater success rate. And really, it's easier to follow a plan that comes at a cost than to follow one that your guru takes issue with.  In the end, when I produce a spreadsheet showing the cost difference, say $1000 over a 3 year period, the response is that it's worth the $1000 to actually succeed. My sole purpose is to simply point out the cost difference between the two methods. $100? Go with the one that makes you feel good. $2000? Just think about it first.  If it's not clear, my issue is less with the fact that the low balance method is inferior and more with its proponents wishing to obfuscate the fact that the high interest method is not only valid but has some savings built in. When a woman called into The David's radio show and said her friend recommended the high rate first method, he dismissed it, and told her that low balance was the only way to go.  The rest of this answer is tangent to the real issue, answered above.  The battle reminds me of how people brag about getting a tax refund. With all due respect to the Tax Software people, the goal should be minimizing one's tax bill. Getting a high refund means you misplanned all year, and lent Uncle Sam money at zero interest(1). And yet you feel good about getting $3000 back in April. (Disclosure - when my father in law passed away, I took over my mother in law's finances. Her IRA RMD, and taxes. First year, I converted some money to Roth, and we had a $100 tax bill. Frowny face on mom. Since then, I have Schwab hold too much federal tax, and we always get about $100 back. This makes her happy, and I'll ignore the 27 cents lost interest.)  (1) - I need to acknowledge that there are cases where the taxpayer has had zero dollars withheld, yet receives a 'tax refund.' The earned income tax credit (EITC) produces a refundable benefit, i.e. a payment that's not conditional on tax due. Obviously, those who benefit from this are not whom I am talking about.  Also, in response to a comment below, the opportunity cost is not the sub-1% rate the bank would have paid you on the money had you held on to it. It's the 18% card you should be paying off. That $3000 refund likely cost over $400 in the interest paid over the prior year.",
            "There are non-financial costs to having a debt: you need to remember to make monthly payments, perhaps keep track of changing interest rates, be aware of conditions of the debt, archive the related paperwork. Life is simpler with fewer debts, and that has value. Of course, if the difference in interest rate is large, then that is more important and the higher interest should be paid off first. But if the difference is only half a percentage point or so, you may decide that having fewer debts is in itself worth the bit of extra interest you pay.",
            "If you have a debt that has very low interest now, but you are aware that it's not going to stay that way (0% introductory APR on a credit card, for example), it can make sense to pay that off before the higher rate kicks in.",
            "I recently paid off a line of credit on an investment property that I own.  I had some surplus cash and decided to pay off the line of credit rather than to make a principal payment on the primary mortgage with a higher interest rate.  The interest rate on the line of credit was tiny and the balance was also pretty low. My reasoning was that by paying off the line of credit I would be done with that account and would have one less bill to pay each month, one less risk of something going wrong and a late payment hurting my credit, one less statement to reconcile each month, and one less bookkeeping core to manage.  I could have grown my net worth by few couple of dollars each month had I kept the line of credit and made a principal payment on the primary loan. I judged that it wasn't worth the hassle and risks.",
            "Another unmentioned reason: flexibility and liquidity.  There is a fundamental difference between installment and revolving debt, such that it could be rational to pay revolving debt before an amortizing loan.   Lets say you have 100K in cash, a 100K mortgage at 4% and 4 25K credit cards at maximum balance and a 0% promotional rate (at least for now).   If you pay off the mortgage, you may not get liquidity if you need it.  This path is not necessarily reversible.   If you pay off the credit cards, you have 100K of credit available to you.  You can reverse to the case of having 100K in cash, and 200K in debt.",
            "I wouldn't advocate it, but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $990 on a $1000 limit credit card with 6% interest and $5000 on a $15k limit card at 10% interest. Having $500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating I believe. I think having $1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $15k limit reflects better than $10k on one $15k card, regardless of interest rates. Personally I think that's dumb b/c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier.",
            "\"It may be the case that some of your debts have a flat regular fee in addition to the interest, which will go away when the debt is completely paid. For example, my mortgage has an approximately $400/year \"\"package fee\"\" as well as its (quite low) interest. When I finish paying the mortgage, I won't have to pay that fee anymore, so it is theoretically possible that spending extra money on paying off my mortgage would be better than spending it on paying off some other debt. I think it's unlikely that it would actually ever be my optimal move in practice, but the point is, there may be an advantage, financial or otherwise, to getting rid of a particular debt, other than merely removing the burden of interest. Those are special situations, though, and in the majority of cases, starting with the highest interest loan will be the right move.\"",
            "Let's say I have two loans (say 2 car loans), and the high interest loan has a higher balance.  Both have a monthly payment of, say, $500. My income fluctuates a lot, so occasionally I only have $750.  I get hit with big fees those months, or maybe I just have to eat beans for those months.  I come on some extra money.  Maybe enough to get rid of the low interest small loan. Paying off the smaller loan frees up cash.  I don't have to eat beans on the bad months.",
            "\"There are a number of bona fide reasons to consider here. If there is a cost to discharging a security packet, or a mortgage, it may not be convenient if we are advanced in the repayment schedule. Early exit fees may apply, or the interest may be \"\"pre-determined\"\". As a rule of thumb, when we are talking about rates above 10% p.a. then arrangements should be short (bridging finance - keep it short and charge 'em heaps), and for personal arrangements, small.\"",
            "This is a slightly different reason to any other answer I have seen here about irrationality and how being rationally aware of one's irrationality (in the future or in different circumstances) can lead you to make decisions which on the face of it seem wrong. First of all, why do people sometimes maintain balances on high-interest debt when they have savings? Standard advice on many money-management sites and forums is to withdraw the savings to pay down the debt. However, I think there is a problem with this. Suppose you have $5,000 in a savings account, and a $2,000 credit card balance. You are paying more interest on the credit card than you get from the savings account, and it seems that you should withdraw some money from the savings account, and pay off the cc. However, the difference between the two scenarios, other than the interest you lose by keeping the cc balance, is your motivation for saving. If you have a credit card balance of $2,000, you might be obliged to pay a minimum payment of $100 each month. If you have any extra money, you will be rewarded if you pay more in to the credit card, by seeing the balance go down and understanding that you will soon be free from receiving this awful bill each month. To maintain your savings goal, it's enough to agree with yourself that you won't do any new spending on the cc, or withdraw any savings.  Now suppose that you decide to pay off the cc with the savings. There is now nothing 'forcing' you to save $100 each month. When you get to the end of the month, you have to motivate yourself that you will be adding spare cash to your $3,000 savings balance, rather than that you 'have to' pay down your cc. Yes, if you spend the spare cash instead of saving it, you get something in return for it. But it is possible that spending $140 on small-scale discretionary spending (things you don't need) actually gets you less for your money than paying the credit card company $40 interest and saving $100? You might even be tempted to start spending on your credit card again, knowing that you have a 0 balance, and that you 'can always pay it off out of savings'. It's easy to analogize this to a situation with two types of debt. Suppose that you have a $2,000 debt to your parents with no interest and a $2,000 loan at high interest, and you get a $2,000 windfall. Let's assume that your parents don't need the money in a hurry and aren't hassling you to pay them (otherwise you could consider the guilt or the hassle as a form of emotional interest rate). Might it not be better to pay your parents off? If you do, you are likely to keep paying off your loan out of necessity of making the regular payments. In 20 paychecks (or whatever) you might be debt free. If you pay off your loan, you lose the incentive to save. After 20 months you still owe your parents $2,000. I am not saying that this is always what makes sense. Just that it could make sense. Note that this is an opposite to the 'Debt Snowball' method. That method says that it's better to pay off small debts, because that way you have more free cash flow to pay off the larger debts. The above argues that this is a bad idea, because you might spend the increased cash flow on junk. It would be better to keep around as many things as possible which have minimum payments, because it restricts you to paying things rather than gives you the choice of whether to save or spend.",
            "One reason to not do that is if you consider that one of the loans is at risk of being called in early.   e.g. You have a line of credit which is close to its limit, and the bank decides to reduce that limit, forcing you to quickly come up with the money to pay it down below the new limit, which can really throw a wrench into your plans.",
            "\"If the balance on the low rate loan is very high (say, an IBR student loan at 6% that accumulates interest every year), and the balance on the high rate loan (say, a CC at 18%) is comparatively very small, then you'd want to make sure that you've at least \"\"stopped the bleeding\"\" on the high balance loan before starting to pay off the CC.\""

        "question": "15 year mortgage vs 30 year paid off in 15",
        "answer": "The choice between a 15-year mortgage and a 30-year mortgage paid off in 15 years depends on several factors, including the interest rate, the flexibility of payments, and your personal financial stability.\n\nFor starters, a 15-year mortgage generally comes with a significantly lower interest rate compared to a 30-year mortgage. This is because there is less risk for the lender due to the shorter payoff period. The difference in rates could range from 0.25% to 0.75%, which can have a considerable impact on the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan .\n\nFor example, a $150K loan with a 15-year term at a 3.00% interest rate would have a monthly payment of $1036. In comparison, a 30-year mortgage with a higher rate (3.75% in the example given) paid off in 15 years would require a monthly payment of $1091. That's a difference of $55 per month, which can be viewed as a \"flexibility premium,\" giving you the option to make lower payments if needed during periods of financial hardship .\n\nIf a 30-year mortgage had exactly the same interest rate as a 15-year mortgage, you would end up paying the same amount in interest if you paid off the 30-year mortgage in 15 years. However, in reality, the interest rates for 15-year mortgages are almost always lower. Also, if you're considering a 30-year mortgage with the intent of paying it off early, make sure there are no prepayment penalties that could incur additional costs .\n\nMoreover, paying more than the scheduled payment on a 30-year mortgage can be inconvenient and may require specific instructions to the lender that the extra payments be applied toward the principal. This might need to be done every month and may involve consistent follow-up to ensure correct application of the payments .\n\nOne has to also consider the potential \"opportunity cost\" of making larger payments on a 15-year loan. This comes down to prioritizing higher-interest debt or recognizing the effects of tax treatments on mortgage payments. However, it's important to weigh these financial considerations against the possibility for unexpected financial needs that may require the flexibility of a lower 30-year mortgage payment .\n\nIn summary, a 15-year mortgage often provides a lower interest rate, potentially saving you money if you can comfortably afford the higher monthly payments. On the other hand, a 30-year mortgage offers more flexibility in payments, which can be beneficial during times of financial uncertainty or if the 15-year payments are not sustainable without hardship  . It's also worth mentioning that lenders in the US typically offer open mortgages that allow for prepayments without penalties, unlike the closed mortgages with prepayment charges more commonly found in Canada .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Your calculations are correct if you use the same mortgage rate for both the 15 and 30 year mortgages.  However, generally when you apply for a 15 year mortgage the interest rate is significantly less than the 30 year rate.  The rate is lower for a number of reasons but mainly there is less risk for the bank on a 15 year payoff plan.",

(In March '15, the average rate in my area is 30yr 3.75% / 15yr 3.00%) For a $150K loan, this puts the 15yr payment at $1036, with the 30 (at higher rate) paid in 15 years at $1091. This $55 difference can be considered a flexibility premium,\"\" as it offers the option to pay the actual $695 in any period the money is needed elsewhere.

            "If the interest rate in both mortgages is the same, then yes, you will end up paying the same amount in interest if both are paid off in 15 years. However, in practice, almost always a 15-year mortgage will have a much lower interest rate that a 30-year mortgage. Also, if you are thinking of taking out a 30-year mortgage with the intention of paying it off early, make sure it does not have an early payment penalty; this is a penalty the bank will charge you if you pay back the loan early.",
            "\"Yes.  It does cost the same to pay off a \"\"15 year in 15\"\" year versus a \"\"30 year in 15 year\"\" mortgage.  After all, the 30 year amortization period is only used by the lender to calculate the monthly payment he'll expect, while, unbeknownst to him, you are using a 15 year amortization and the same rate to calculate the payments you'll really make. One factor:  Can you make extra payments at the level you want, without incurring penalties from the lender?  Most mortgages have prepayment limits.  After all. he's seeing his nice steady 30 years of cash flow suddenly shortened.  He has to go out and find someone else to lend the unexpected payments to...

            "All of the answers given so far are correct, but rather narrow. When you buy a 30-year-mortgage, you are buying the right to pay off the debt in as long as 30 years.  What you pay depends on the interest rate and how long you actually take to pay it off (and principal and points and so on). Just as you are buying that right, the mortgager is selling you that right, and they usually charge something for it, typically a higher rate.  After all, they, and not you, will be exposed to interest risk for 30 years. However, if some bank has an aneurism and is willing to give you a 30-year loan for the same price as or lower than any other bank is willing to go for a 15-year loan, hey, free flexibility.  Might as well take it.  If you want to pay the loan off in 15 year, or 10 or 20, you can go ahead and do so.",
            "Besides the reason in @rhaskett's answer, it is important to consider that paying off a 30-year mortgage as if it was a 15-year is much more inconvenient than just paying the regular payments of a 15-year mortgage.  When you pay extra on your mortgage, some lenders do not know what to do with the extra payment, and need to be told explicitly that the extra needs to be applied toward the principal.  You might need to do this every month with every payment.  In addition, some lenders won't allow you to set up an automatic payment for more than the mortgage payment, so you might need to explicitly submit your payment with instructions for the lender each month, and then follow up each month to make sure that your payment was credited properly.  Some lenders are better about this type of thing than others, and you won't really know how much of a hassle it will be with your lender until you start making payments. If you intend to pay it off in 15 years, then just get the 15-year mortgage.",
            "\"Consider the \"\"opportunity cost\"\" of the extra repayment on a 15 year loan.  If you owe money at 30% p.a. and money at 4% p.a. then it is a no brainer that the 30% loan gets paid down first. Consider too that if the mortgage is not tax deductable and you pay income tax, that you do not pay tax on money you \"\"save\"\". (i.e. in the extreme $1 saved is $2 earned). Forward thinking is key, if you are paying for someone's college now, then you would want to pay out of an education plan for which contributions are tax deductable, money in, money out. In my country most mortgages, be they 15,25,30 years tend to last 6-8 years for the lender. People move or flip or re-finance.  I would take the 15 for the interest rate but only if I could sustain the payments without hardship. Maybe a more modest home ?   If you cannot afford the higher repayments you are probably sailing a bit close to the wind anyway.   Another thing to consider is that tax benefits can be altered with the stroke of a pen, but you may still have to meet repayments.\"",
            "Other people have belabored the point that you will get a better rate on a 15 year mortgage, typically around 1.25 % lower. The lower rate makes the 15 year mortgage financially wiser than paying a 30 year mortgage off in 15 years.  So go with the 15 year if your income is stable, you will never lose your job, your appliances never break, your vehicles never need major repairs, the pipes in your house never burst, you and your spouse never get sick, and you have no kids. Or if you do have kids, they happen to have good eyesight, straight teeth, they have no aspirations for college, don't play any expensive sports, and they will never ask for help paying the rent when they get older and move out.  But if any of those things are likely possibilities, the 30 year mortgage would give you some flexibility to cover short term cash shortages by reverting to your normal 30 year payment for a month or two. Now, the financially wise may balk at this because you are supposed to have enough cash in reserves to cover stuff like this, and that is good advice. But how many people struggle to maintain those reserves when they buy a new house?  Consider putting together spreadsheet and calculating the interest cost difference between the two strategies. How much more will the 30 year mortgage cost you in interest if you pay it off in 15 years? That amount equates to the cost of an insurance policy for dealing with an occasional cash shortage. Do you want to pay thousands in extra interest for that insurance? (it is pretty pricey insurance) One strategy would be to go with the 30 year now, make the extra principal payments to keep you on a 15 year schedule, see how life goes, and refinance to a 15 year mortgage after a couple years if everything goes well and your cash reserves are strong. Unfortunately, rates are likely to rise over the next couple years, which makes this strategy less attractive. If at all possible, go with the 15 year so you lock in these near historic low rates. Consider buying less house or dropping back to the 30 year if you are worried that your cash reserves won't be able to handle life's little surprises.",
            "\"I just wanted to point out that the most \"\"leverage\"\" for pre-paying occurs at the very beginning of the mortgage, and declines rapidly after that. So, your very best scenario is to get the 30-year, and make one extra payment entirely to principal the first month of every year. This causes the amortization to drop by 96 payments, to about 22 years. I don't know of any other way that you can get nearly 4 times value for your money (22 payments extra to save 96 payments later). After that, reducing from 22 to 15 years takes more of your money for the same result, but do it if you want. I actually did this, and it put me way ahead when I sold the house about 12 years later.\"",
            "Actually the extra payment comes off the back end of the mortgage. So technically the mortgage is ony reduced one month.  However, banks always recalculate the amortization table when the last payment is paid or a payoff amount is requested. There is a difference between the two situations but that is a minor amount. The 30 year note offers flexibility that the 15 does not. Pick one, save money-15 year, get flexibility-30 year.",
            "Why won't anyone just answer the original question? The question was not about opportunity cost or flexibility or family expenses. There are no right answers to any of those things and they all depend on individual circumstances. I believe the answer to the question of whether paying off a 30-year mortgage in 15 years would cost the same amount as a 15-year mortgage of the same interest rate is yes but ONLY if you pay it off on the exact same schedule as your supposed 15-year. In reality, the answer is NO for two reasons: the amortization schedule; and the fact that the 30-year will always have a higher interest rate than the 15-year. The way mortgages are amortized, the interest is paid first, essentially. For most people the majority of the monthly payment is interest for the first half of the loan's life. This is good for most people because, in reality, most mortgages only last a couple years after which people refinance or move and for those first couple years the majority of one's housing costs (interest) are tax deductible. It is arguable whether perpetuating this for one's entire life is wise... but that's the reality of most mortgages. So, unless you pay off your 30-year on the exact same amortization schedule of your theoretical 15-year, you will pay more in interest. A common strategy people pursue is paying an extra monthly payment (or more) each year. By the time you get around to chipping away at your principal in that way, you will already have paid a lot more interest than you would have on a 15-year. And, really, if you can afford to substantially pay down principal in the first year or two of your mortgage, you probably should've borrowed less money to begin with. In theory, IF the rates were the same (they're not) and IF you paid the 30 off every month in the EXACT same way as you would've paid a 15 (you won't) you will pay the same amount in the end. You have to decide if the flexibility is worth more to you than the cost savings.  For example: a 300k mortgage at 3.5% will have a monthly payment of ~$2150 for a 15-year and ~$1350 for a 30-year, both will start with ~$875/month of that being in interest (gradually declining with time). What I think most people undervalue is the freedom and peace of mind that comes with a paid off or nearly paid off home... and 15 years is a lot more tangible than 30, plus a lot cheaper over all. If you can afford a 15-year mortgage without putting too much stress on your budget, it is definitely the better option for financial security.  And be careful of the index fund opportunity cost advice. On average it may be a good idea when you look at the very long run, historically, but a lot of people get less than average returns depending on when they buy and what the market does in the short run. There is no certainty around what returns you will get from the stock market, but if you have a 30-year mortgage there is a lot of certainty around what you will owe every month for the next 30-years. Different mixes of investments make sense for different people, and most people would be wise to get some exposure to the stock market for its returns and liquidity. However, if someone's goal is borrowing more money for their house in order to invest more money in the stock market for their retirement, they would actually be better served in achieving security and independence 15 years sooner."

        "answer": "The document provides a description of Put-Call Parity and illustrates the difference between two representations of it. Put-Call Parity is a financial principle that defines a relationship between the prices of European put and call options with the same strike price and expiry date.\n\nThe standard Put-Call Parity formula at expiry T is represented as:\n\\[ C(T) - P(T) = S(T) - K \\]\nwhere \\( C(T) \\) is the price of the call option at expiry, \\( P(T) \\) is the price of the put option at expiry, \\( S(T) \\) is the spot price of the underlying asset at expiry, and \\( K \\) is the strike price.\n\nFor a non-dividend-paying stock (assuming no cost of carry), the Put-Call Parity representation at the current time 0 can be derived as follows:\n\\[ C(0) - P(0) = S(0) - df \\cdot K \\]\nwhere \\( df \\) is the discount factor to the expiry date T. This can be rearranged to show the price of the call option at time 0:\n\\[ C(0) = S(0) - df \\cdot K + P(0) \\]\nThis is the value of the call if it's sold or held.\n\nIf the call option is exercised early, the value upon exercising is:\n\\[ C_{\\text{ex}} = S(0) - K \\]\nHowever, as the document points out, \\( C(0) > C_{\\text{ex}} \\) because when selling or holding the call, a smaller amount is subtracted due to the discount factor on the strike price (df*K < K), and the put option price \\( P(0) \\) is also added to the value.\n\nThe difference between the two representations lies in the consideration of the option's value now versus at expiry, and whether the option is exercised or sold. When choosing between exercising the call option early or selling it, selling it is always more valuable because it retains the time value and includes the price of the put option.",

Typically, the continuously-compounded models represent the ideal; as the compounding period of time-valued money shrinks towards zero, and the discount rate (or interest rate if positive) stays constant over the time period examined, the periodic equation's results approach that of the continuously-compounded equation. Those two assumptions (a constant rate and continuous balance adjustment from interest) that allow simplification to the continuous form are usually incorrect in real-world finance; virtually all financial institutions accrue interest monthly, for a variety of reasons including simpler bookkeeping and less money paid or owed in interest. They also, unless prohibited by contract, accrue this interest based on a rate that can change daily or even more granularly based on what financial markets are doing. Most often, the calculation is periodic based on the \"\"average daily balance\"\" and an agreed rate that, if variable, is based on the \"\"average daily rate\"\" over the previous observed period. So, you should use the first form for fast calculation of a rough value based on estimated variables. You should use the second form when you have accurate periodic information on the variables involved.

        "question": "Why might it be advisable to keep student debt vs. paying it off quickly?",
        "answer": "There are several reasons why it might be advisable to keep student debt rather than paying it off quickly:\n\n1. **Interest Rates vs. Inflation**: If the interest rate on the student loan is lower than the inflation rate, then effectively, the debt becomes \"cheaper\" over time. In periods where inflation rates are expected to rise, keeping the debt and paying it off slowly could be financially advantageous .\n\n2. **Tax Advantages**: Some student loans offer the possibility to deduct interest payments on your taxes. This can provide a financial benefit that might not be available if the loan is paid off early. However, this is a deduction, not a credit, meaning the actual savings depend on your tax bracket .\n\n3. **Credit Score Impact**: Paying off an installment loan prematurely can affect your credit score. Some people might prefer to extend the payment period of their student loans to maintain their credit score, especially if this is their only form of installment debt .\n\n4. **Investment Opportunities**: Prioritizing other investments, such as retirement accounts like 401(k)s and Roth IRAs, could offer higher long-term returns than the interest saved by repaying student loans early. This strategy only makes sense if you have already saved enough for emergencies and don't have other higher-interest debt .\n\n5. **Debt Forgiveness Programs**: Some occupations, like teaching in certain areas or special disciplines, can qualify for student loan debt forgiveness. However, these programs often have specific conditions and limitations, so it's essential to thoroughly investigate them before relying on them as part of your repayment strategy .\n\n6. **Cash Flow Management**: Holding onto savings rather than using them to pay off student debt immediately can offer financial flexibility. For example, having savings in case of job loss could be more beneficial than being debt-free but without any cash reserves .\n\n7. **Debt Comparison and Prioritization**: When managing multiple debts, it's crucial to prioritize based on the interest rates and terms of each. Paying off high-interest credit card debt or loans from payday lenders should generally take precedence over student loans, especially if your student debt has relatively favorable terms .\n\n8. **Lending Opportunities**: Student loans are not considered traditional debt by some lenders, which might allow you to qualify for lending opportunities that would otherwise not be available .\n\nThese considerations can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances, including income, living expenses, other debts, and personal financial goals. It's crucial to assess the specifics of your situation to determine the best strategy for managing student debt.",

            "\"There are several ways you can get out of paying your student loans back in the USA: You become disabled and the loan is dismissed once verified by treating doctor or the Social Security Administration.

So the \"\"malicious\"\" friend B is prescribing to the theory that if one of those conditions becomes true, friend A will not have to pay back the loan. The longer you drag it out, the more chance you have to fulfill a condition. Given that 2 of these methods require a commitment, my guess is that they are thinking more along the lines of the first one, which is horrible. Financially, it makes no sense to delay paying back your loans because deferred loans are only interest-free until you graduate and are past your grace period, after which they will begin accruing interest. Unsubsidized loans accrue interest from the day you get them, only their payback is deferred until you graduate and exhaust your grace period. Anytime you ask for forbearance, you are still accruing interest and it is capitalizing into your principal \u2014 you are just given a chance to delay payback due to financial hardship, bad health, or loss of job. Therefore, at no point are you benefiting beyond the time you are in school and getting an education, still looking for a job, or dealing with health issues. In the current market, no CD, no savings account, and no investment will give you substantially more return that will offset the loss of the interest you are accruing. Even those of us in the old days getting 4.X % rates would not do this. There was a conditional consolidation offer the DOE allowed which could bring all your loans under one roof for a competitive 5.x-6.x % rate allowing you a single payment, but even then you would benefit if you had rates that were substantially higher. From a credit worthiness aspect, you are hurt by the outstanding obligation and any default along the way, so you really want to avoid that \u2014 paying off or down your loans are a good way to ensure you don't shoot yourself in the foot.\"",

If the loan payment has no effect on the mortgage one qualifies for, that's one thing, but taking say $20K to pay it off will impact the house you can buy. For a 20% down purchase, this multiplies up to $100k less house. Or worse, a lower down payment percent then requiring PMI.

            "\"If the interest rate on the student loan is lower than inflation, then the student loan will be \"\"cheaper\"\" the longer you take to pay it.   This is now a very rare instance, but there were programs and loan consolidation opportunities in the mid-200x's that allowed savvy student's to convert their loans to have an interest rate of around 1.5%. Right now the inflation rate is actually quite low, but it's not expected to stay there, and wasn't that low just a few years ago, so in the long run this type of debt will only be cheaper the longer it takes to pay off. It is risky, as others point out, as it can't be written off in bankruptcy, but there are other situations where it can be written off more easily than other debts, so on balance the risks aren't better or worse than other loans in general.  For specific individual situations the risk equation might work out differently, though. Further, student loans aren't considered traditional debt by some lenders for specific lending opportunities, thus allowing you to go into greater debt for certain types of purchases.  Whether this is good for you or not depends on the importance of the purchase. If you need to buy a house and the interest rate is higher than your student loan rate, it will be better, financially, to pay off the house first, while paying the minimum on the student loans.   If you have no other debt with a higher interest, and the student loan interest is higher than inflation, there is no reason to delay paying off the student loan.\"",
            "Congratulations for achieving an important step in the road to financial freedom. Some view extending loan payment of loans that allow the deduction of interest as a good thing. Some view the hit on the credit score by prematurely paying off an installment loan as a bad thing.  Determining the order of paying off multiple loans in conjunction with the reality of income, required monthly living expense, and the need to save for emergencies is highly individualized.  Keeping an artificial debt seems to make little sense, it is an expensive insurance policy to chase a diminishing tax benefit and boost to a credit score. Keep in mind it is a deduction, not a credit, so how much you save depends on your tax bracket.  It might make sense for somebody to extend the loan out for an extra year or two, but you can't just assume that that advice applies in your situation.

So if you have the choice between spending/wasting your money and paying off debt, I would recommend paying off the debt.  The other question is whether having student debt is better than having other debt. You need to look at the terms of your student debt. Pay off the debt with the worst conditions first. Loan sharks (in Britain: pay-day loans) must be paid first. Credit cards debt must go next. Then general loans. Depending on your situation, you may want some savings as well. In case you lose your job, for example. So if you have $8,000 saved and an $8,000 student loan, you might consider waiting a bit before you pay back the loan.

Do verify this as it's been several years since I looked into the matter. The DOE has a student loan forgiveness program, but the scope of it is somewhat narrow.

            "Like all other loan-vs-savings questions, it depends on the terms of the loan. If you have a choice, the usual answer is to pay off the loan with the worst terms (which usually means the highest interest rate) first, and only start with savings when you've paid off all the high-interest loans entirely. If your student loan is on US terms, then pay it off as soon as you can, unless you have commercial debt (credit-card or unsecured personal loan), which you should pay off first, or unless you have or are realistically likely to get eligibility for a forgiveness program. But it does depends on the terms of the debt, which in turn depend on the country you studied in; on UK terms it's a very bad idea to pay off a student loan any faster than you have to.  Interest is restricted to the rate of inflation, so good investments probably beat the interest rate of the student loan; the required repayments vary with your income, so savings are more useful than debt repayment if you encounter income difficulties (e.g unemployment) in the future, and finally the debt is automatically forgiven after 30 years, so you may never have to pay it all back anyway - so why pay it off voluntarily if it would get forgiven eventually anyway?",

That combined with the low interest and the super-low-pressure-sales-tactics means I just literally don't have any incentive to ever pay it all off. Like I said before, I'm just a guy who has student loans, and not even one who is particularly good with money, but as someone who does choose not to pay off my student loans any faster than I have to, this is why."

There may be bids at $10, with asking (me) at $10.50. No trades will happen until a seller takes the $10 bid or other buyers and sellers come in.\""

        "answer": "The document you provided discusses the use of fundamental analysis and highlights that while it may not provide exact market entry signals, it is crucial for understanding what to buy. Fundamental analysis is described as more time-consuming than technical analysis, requiring both a micro perspective (company-specific details) and a macro perspective (industry details). For investors looking at sector ETFs or commodities, this can involve a broad range of factors from multiple countries.\n\nWhen conducting fundamental analysis, focus is recommended on three key financial statements:\n1. The Income Statement\n2. The Balance Sheet\n3. The Cash Flow Statement\n\nSpecific ratios are also mentioned that can be useful indicators for fundamental analysis:\n- **Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: A standard measure for income which indicates how much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio or Debt to Capital (Debt+Equity) Ratio**: These ratios provide insight into a company's financial leverage and are calculated from the balance sheet. \n- **Price to Cash Flow or Price to Free Cash Flow**: These ratios help evaluate the company's cash generation in relation to its market value.\n\nWhile these fundamental indicators can advise on what to invest in, they do not give precise entry signals on when to execute the trade. That timing aspect is typically addressed by technical analysis, which provides tools and indicators to determine entry points based on price movements and patterns .",

            "\"Unfortunately, there is very little data supporting fundamental analysis or technical analysis as appropriate tools to \"\"time\"\" the market. I will be so bold to say that technical analysis is meaningless. On the other hand, fundamental analysis has some merits. For example, the realization that CDOs were filled with toxic mortgages can be considered a product of fundamental analysis and hence provided traders with a directional assumption to buy CDSs. However, there is no way to tell when there is a good or bad time to buy or sell. The market behaves like a random 50/50 motion. There are many reasons for this and interestingly, there are many fundamentally sound companies that take large dips for no reason at all. Depending on your goal, you can either believe that this volatility will smooth over long periods and that the market has generally positive drift. On the other hand, I feel that the appropriate approach is to remain active. You will be able to mitigate the large downswings by simply staying small and diversifying  - not in the sense of traditional finance but rather looking for uncorrelated products. Remember, volatility brings higher levels of correlation. My second suggestion is to look towards products like options to provide a method of shaping your P/L - giving up upside by selling calls against a long equity position is a great example. Ground your trades with fundamental beliefs if need be, but use your tools and knowledge to combat risks that may create long periods of drawdown.\"",
            "I think by definition there aren't, generally speaking, any indicators (as in chart indicators, I assume you mean)  for fundamental analysis. Off the top of my head I can't think of one chart indicator that I wouldn't call 'technical', even though a couple could possibly go either way and I'm sure someone will help prove me wrong. But the point I want to make is that to do fundamental analysis, it is most certainly more time consuming. Depending on what instrument you're investing in, you need to have a micro perspective (company specific details) and a macro perspective (about the industry it's in). If you're investing in sector ETFs or the like, you'd be more reliant on the macro analysis. If you're investing in commodities, you'll need to consider macro analysis in multiple countries who are big producers/consumers of the item. There's no cut and dried way to do it, however I personally opt for a macro analysis of sector ETFs and then use technical analysis to determine my entry and/or exit.",
            "The three places you want to focus on are the income statement, the balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The standard measure for multiple of income is the P/E or price earnings ratio  For the balance sheet, the debt to equity or debt to capital (debt+equity) ratio. For cash generation, price to cash flow, or price to free cash flow. (The lower the better, all other things being equal, for all three ratios.)",
            "Fundamental Analysis can be used to help you determine what to buy, but they won't give you an entry signal for when to buy. Technical Analysis can be used to help you determine when to buy, and can give you entry signals for when to buy. There are many Technical Indicator which can be used as an entry signal, from as simple as the price crossing above a moving average line and then selling when the price crosses back below the moving average line, to as complicated as using a combination of indicators to all line up for an entry signal to be valid.

        "question": "Why does short selling require borrowing?",
        "answer": "Short selling requires borrowing because when you sell short, you essentially sell shares that you do not currently own. The process involves borrowing shares from a lender with the obligation to return them at a later date. The short seller sells these borrowed shares immediately in the hope that the stock price will decrease. Once the price has decreased, the short seller buys back the same number of shares at this lower price to return to the lender. This transaction allows the short seller to profit from the difference between the higher selling price and the lower buying price, minus any fees for borrowing the shares.\n\nThe borrowing is crucial because selling what you do not own without borrowing would lead to selling non-existent shares, which could distort the market. This could lead to problematic consequences such as driving the price down unfairly, to the disadvantage of current shareholders, and resulting in short sellers owing more in dividends than what is actually being paid by the company. Therefore, borrowing ensures that there is a real exchange of securities, and the market operates on the matching of real buyers and sellers . \n\nAdditionally, the buyer of a short-sold share assumes the benefits and rights of share ownership immediately, such as receiving dividends and voting at shareholder meetings. Without borrowing the shares first, the buyer of these non-existent shares would be deprived of the rights associated with ownership, which is not permissible in the cash market which is predicated on the exchange of genuine ownership .\n\nSelling short through borrowing also serves as a means to facilitate a market position based on the anticipation of a stock's price decrease, allowing the investor to sell high first and then buy low later, which is contrary to the typical 'buy low, sell high' strategy used in long positions .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "why can't I just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way    down? Because if you sell shares out of your own portfolio, by definition, you are not selling short at all. If you sell something you own (and deliver it) - then there is no short involved. A short is defined as a net negative position - i.e. you sell shares you do not have. Selling shares you own is selling shares you own - no short involved. You must borrow the shares for a short because in the stock market, you must DELIVER. You can not deliver shares you do not own. The stock market does not work on promises - the person who bought the shares expects ownership of them with all rights that gives them. So you borrow them to deliver them, then return them when you buy them back.",
            "In order to compare the two, you need to compare your entire portfolio, which is not just how much money you have, but how much stock. In both scenarios, you start with (at least, but let's assume) \u00a320 and 0 stock. In your scenario, you buy 10 shares, leaving you with \u00a30 and 10 shares. You then sell it at \u00a31.50/share to cut your losses, leaving you with \u00a315 and 0 shares. That concludes the first transaction with a net loss of \u00a35. In a second transaction, you then buy 10 shares again at \u00a31/share, leaving you with \u00a35 and 10 shares. You are still down \u00a315 from the start, but you also still have 10 shares. Any further profit or loss depends on what you can get for those 10 shares in the future. In a short sale, you borrow 10 shares and sell them, leaving you with \u00a340 (your initial \u00a320 plus what you just made on the short sale) and -10 shares of stock. At the end of the contract, you must buy 10 shares to return them; you are able to do so at \u00a31.50/share, leaving you with \u00a325 and 0 shares. At this point, your exposure to the stock is complete, and you have a net gain of \u00a35.",
            "\"Concerning the general problem of short selling and the need to borrow shares to complete the transaction : Selling short is a cash transaction.  Unlike a futures contract, where a short seller is entering into a legal agreement to sell something in the future, in the case of short selling a share the buyer of the share is taking immediate delivery and is therefore entitled to all of the benefits and rights that come with share ownership.  In particular, the buyer of the shares is entitled to any dividends payable and, where applicable, to vote on motions at AGMs.  If the short seller has not borrowed the shares to sell, then buyer of non-existent shares will have none of the rights associated with ownership. The cash market is based on the idea of matching buyers and sellers.  It does not accommodate people making promises. Consider that to allow short sellers to sell shares they have not borrowed opens up the possibility of the aggregate market selling more shares than actually exist.  This would lead to all sorts of problematic consequences such as heavily distorting the price of the underlying share.  If everyone is selling shares they have not borrowed willy-nilly, then it will drive the price of the share down, much to the disadvantage of existing share holders. In this case, short sellers who have sold shares they have not already borrowed would be paying out more in dividends to the buyers than the total dividends being paid out by the underlying company. There are instruments that allow for short selling of unowned shares on a futures basis.  One example is a CFD = Contract for Difference.  In the case of CFDs, sellers are obliged to pay dividends to buyers as well as other  costs related to financing. EDIT Regarding your comment, note that borrowing shares is not a market transaction.  Your account does not show you buying a share and then selling it.  It simply shows you selling a share short.  The borrowing is the result of an agreement between yourself and the lender and this agreement is off market.  You do not actually pay the lender for the shares, but you do pay financing costs for the borrowing so long as you maintain your short position. EDIT I realise that I have not actually read your question correctly.  You are not actually talking about \"\"naked\"\" short selling.  You are talking about selling shares you already own in a hope of maintaining both a long and short position (gross).  The problem with this approach is that you must deliver the shares to the buyer.  Otherwise, ask yourself what shares is the buyer actually buying if you want the bought shares to remain in your account. If you are not going to deliver your long position shares, then you will need to borrow the shares you are selling short for the reasons I have outlined above.\"",
            "\"Selling short is simply by definition the selling, then later re-buying of stock you don't initially own. Say you tally your entire portfolio balance: the quantity of each stock you own, and your cash assets. Let's call this your \"\"initial position\"\". We define \"\"profit\"\" as any increase in assets, relative to this initial position. If you know a particular stock will go down, you can realize a profit by selling some of that stock, waiting for the price to go down, then buying it back. In the end you will have returned to your initial position, except you will have more cash. If you sell 10 shares of a stock valued at \u00a31.50, then buy them back at \u00a31.00, you will make a \u00a35.00 profit while having otherwise returned to your previous position. If you do the same, but you initially owned 1000 shares, sold just 10 of those, then bought 10 back, that's still a profit of \u00a35.00. Selling short is doing the same thing, but with an initial and ending balance of 0 shares. If you initially own 0 shares, sell 10, then buy 10 back, you return to your initial position (0 shares) plus a profit of \u00a35.00. (And in practice you must also pay a borrowing fee to do this.) The advantage of selling short is it can be done with any stock, not just those currently owned.\"",
            "This can be best explained with an example. Bob thinks the price of a stock that Alice has is going to go down by the end of the week, so he borrows a share at $25 from Alice. The current price of the shares are $25 per share. Bob immediately sells the shares to Charlie for $25, it is fair, it is the current market price. A week goes by, and the price does fall to $20. Bob buys a share from David at $20. This is fair, it is the current market value. Then Bob gives the share back to Alice to settle what he borrowed from her, one share. Now, in reality, there is interest charged be Alice on the borrowed value, but to keep it simple, we'll say she was a friend and it was a zero interest loan. So then Bob was able to sell something he didn't own for $25 and return it spending $20 to buy it, settling his loan and making $5 in the transaction. It is the selling to Charlie and buying from David (or even Charlie later, if he decided to dump the shares), without having invested any of your own money that earns the profit.",
            "\"A simple way to ask the question might be to say \"\"why can't I just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way down? Why is borrowing someone else's shares necessary to make the concept a viable one? Why isn't it just the inverse of 'going long'?\"\" A simple way to think about it is this: to make money by trading something, you must buy it for less than you sell it for.  This applies to stocks like anything else.  If you believe the price will go up, then you can buy them first and sell them later for a higher price.  But if you believe the price will go down, the only way to buy low and sell high is to sell first and buy later.  If you buy the stock and it goes down, any sale you make will lose you money. I'm still not sure I fully understand the point of your example, but one thing to note is that in both cases (i.e., whether you buy the share back at the end or not), you lost money.  You say that you \"\"made $5 on the share price dropping\"\", but that isn't true at all: you can see in your example that your final account balance is negative in both cases.  You paid $20 for the shares but only got $15 back; you lost $5 (or, in the other version of your example, paid $20 and got back $5 plus the depreciated shares). If you had bought the shares for $20 and sold them for, say, $25, then your account would end up with a positive $5 balance; that is what a gain would look like.  But you can't achieve that if you buy the shares for $20 and later sell them for less. At a guess, you seem to be confusing the concept of making a profit with the concept of cutting your losses.  It is true that if you buy the shares for $20 and sell them for $15, you lose only $5, whereas if you buy them for $20 and sell for $10, you lose the larger amount of $10.  But those are both losses.  Selling \"\"early\"\" as the price goes down doesn't make you any money; it just stops you from losing more money than you would if you sold later.\"",
            "You can't make money on the way down if it was your money that bought the shares when the market was up.  When you sell short, borrowing lets you tap into the value without paying for it. That way, when the price (hopefully) drops you profit from the difference. In your example, if you hadn't paid the \u00a320 in the first place, then you would actually be up \u00a35. But since you started with \u00a320, you still show loss. As others said, borrowing is the definition of selling short. It is also simply the only way the math works. Of course, there is a large risk you must assume to enjoy benefiting from something you do not own!",
            "It's actually quite simple. You're actually confusing two concept. Which are taking a short position and short selling itself. Basically when taking a short position is by believing that the stock is going to drop and you sell it. You can or not buy it back later depending on the believe it grows again or not. So basically you didn't make any profit with the drop in the price's value but you didn't lose money either.  Ok but what if you believe the market or specific company is going to drop and you want to profit on it while it's dropping. You can't do this by buying stock because you would be going long right? So back to the basics. To obtain any type of profit I need to buy low and sell high, right? This is natural for use in long positions. Well, now knowing that you can sell high at the current moment and buy low in the future what do you do? You can't sell what you don't have. So acquire it. Ask someone to lend it to you for some time and sell it. So selling high, check.  Now buying low? You promised the person you would return him his stock, as it's intangible he won't even notice it's a different unit, so you buy low and return the lender his stock. Thus you bought low and sold high, meaning having a profit. So technically short selling is a type of short position. If you have multiple portfolios and lend yourself (i.e. maintaining a long-term long position while making some money with a short term short-term strategy) you're actually short selling with your own stock. This happens often in hedge funds where multiple strategies are used and to optimise the transaction costs and borrowing fees, they have algorithms that clear (match) long and short coming in from different traders, algorithms, etc. Keep in mind that you while have a opportunities risk associated.  So basically, yes, you need to always 'borrow' a product to be able to short sell it. What can happen is that you lend yourself but this only makes sense if:"

        "question": "What are my best options if I don't have a lot of credit lines for housing loans?",
        "answer": "If you don't have a lot of credit lines for housing loans, your best options might include the following:\n\n1. **FHA Loan**: An FHA loan could be suitable, especially for first-time buyers, as it requires a lower down payment of 3.5% and you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580. FHA loans have built-in mortgage insurance, which may make them more expensive than conventional mortgages if you can't put down a 20% payment .\n\n2. **Manual Underwriting**: Find lenders that do manual underwriting rather than computer-generated evaluations. If you can show a 20% down payment, have some savings, and a history of paying bills on time, you may get approved despite having a limited number of credit lines. This includes looking into local credit unions or specific lenders known for manual underwriting like RP Funding or Church Hill Mortgage in Florida .\n\n3. **Shop Around for Lenders**: Look for lenders that might pre-qualify you with your current credit. Sometimes local banks or credit unions are more flexible than large banks like Bank of America and might be willing to work with you despite traditional credit requirements .\n\n4. **Non-Traditional Creditors**: You may also consider getting a mortgage financed by private parties or through mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions. These might be less restrictive though potentially with higher interest rates if you have limited credit lines .\n\n5. **Credit Score Improvement Tools**: Utilize websites that offer free credit scores and advice. They often provide credit score simulators which can give you insights into how your score might change with different financial actions .\n\nRemember, each option comes with its own sets of pros and cons. Make sure to consider the mortgage insurance costs with FHA loans and the higher interest rates that may come with loans from private parties. Additionally, manual underwriting can be more personal but may require more evidence of financial stability. Always consult with a financial advisor to understand what could be the best course for your situation.",

            "\"Rather than trying to indirectly game your credit score, I would instead shop around and see if there are other lenders that will pre-qualify you with your credit the way it is today.  BofA and other large banks can be very formulaic in how they qualify loans; a local bank or credit union may be more willing to bend the traditional \"\"rules\"\" and pre-qualify you.   I'm thinking about using FHA. If you can put 20% down then a conventional mortgage will likely be cheaper than an FHA loan since FHA loans have mortgage insurance built-in while conventional mortgages typically don't require it if you borrow less than 80% of the house's value.  I would shop around before jumping to an FHA loan.\"",
            "The short answer is, with limited credit, your best bet might be an FHA loan for first time buyers.  They only require 3.5% down (if I recall the number right), and you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580. The problem is that even if you were to add new credit lines (such as signing up for new credit cards, etc.), they still take time to have a positive effect on your credit.  First, your score takes a bit of a hit with each new hard inquiry by a prospective creditor, then your score will dip slightly when a new credit account is first added. While your credit score will improve somewhat within a few months of adding new credit and you begin to show payment history on those accounts, your average age of accounts needs to be two years or older for the best effect, assuming you're making all of the payments on time. A good happy medium is to have between 7 and 10 credit lines on your credit history, and to make sure it's a mix of account types, such as store cards, installment loans, and credit cards, to show that you can handle various types of credit. Be careful not to add TOO much credit, because it affects your debt-to-income ratio, and that will have a negative effect on your ability to obtain mortgage financing. I really suggest that you look at some of the sites which offer free credit scores, because some of them provide great advice and tips on how to achieve what you're trying to do.  They also offer credit score simulators, which can help you understand how your score might change if, for instance, you add new credit cards, pay off existing cards, or take on installment loans.  It's well worth checking out. I hope this helps.  Good luck!"

        "answer": "Closing credit cards can be a good idea in certain circumstances. The decision to close a credit card should take into account factors such as credit utilization and the average age of accounts. If your cards with zero balances are newer or have much lower limits than those you are carrying balances on, closing them could potentially raise your credit score by reducing utilization and increasing the average age of your open accounts .\n\nAdditionally, there are other considerations beyond just the influence on your credit score:\n\n1. Security Aspect: Having fewer active cards can decrease the risk of having your card information stolen and misused.\n2. Financial Discipline: Closing credit cards might be a good step if you believe that it's necessary to prevent misuse of credit.\n\nHowever, the document also suggests that if your credit score is already high or you don't have an immediate need for a high score, the impact of closing a few accounts may be minimal. Moreover, credit utilization has only a temporary effect on the score, so if you're actively paying down debt, closing accounts might not have a long-term negative effect. In some cases, closing older accounts could even lead to an increase in your credit score after an initial small drop.\n\nHence, closing credit cards can be strategically beneficial if done thoughtfully and taking into consideration your overall financial situation and habits.

I am going to give some reasons why it can be a good idea to close unused accounts, and then I will talk about why it is NOT necessarily a bad idea. Why it can be a good idea to close unused accounts \"\"I'd like to close the cards.\"\"  That is reason enough.   Simplifying your financial life is a good thing.  Fewer accounts let you focus your energy on the accounts that you actually use. Unused accounts still need to be monitored for fraud. You mentioned that you have high credit card balances that you are carrying.  This may indicate that you have trouble using credit responsibly, and having more credit available to you might be a temptation for you. If these unused cards have annual fees, keeping them open will cost money. Unused cards sometimes get closed by the bank due to inactivity.  As a result, the advice often given is that, in addition to not closing them, you are supposed to charge something to it every month.  This, of course, takes more of your time and energy to worry about, as well as giving you another monthly bill to pay. Why it is NOT necessarily a bad idea to close unused accounts Other answers will tell you that it may hurt your credit score for two reasons: it would increase your utilization and lower your average account age.  Before we talk about the validity of these two points, we need to discuss the importance of the credit score. Depending on what your credit score currently is, these actions may have minimal impact on your life.  If you are in the mid 700's or higher, your score is excellent, and closing these cards will likely not impact anything for you in a significant way. If you aren't that high in your score yet, do you have an immediate need for a high score?  Are you planning on getting more credit cards, or take out any more loans?  I would suggest that, since you have credit card debt, you shouldn't be taking out any new loans until you get that cleaned up.  So your score in the mean time is not very important. Are you currently working on eliminating this credit card debt?  If so, your utilization number will improve, even after you close these accounts, when you get those paid off.  Utilization has only a temporary effect on your score; when your utilization improves, your score improves immediately. Your average account age may or may not improve when you close these accounts, depending on how old they are compared to the accounts you are leaving open.  However, the impact of this might not be as much as you think. I realize that this advice is different from other answers, or other things that you may read online.  But in my own life, I do a lot of things that are supposedly bad for the credit score: I only have two credit cards, ages 2.5 and 1.5 years.  (I closed my other cards when I got these.)  My typical monthly utilization is around 25% on these cards, although I pay off the balance in full each month, never paying interest.  I have no car loan anymore, and my mortgage is only 4 months old.  No other debt.  Despite those \"\"terrible\"\" credit practices, my credit score is very high. Conclusion Make your payments on time, get out of debt, and your score will be fine.  Don't keep unwanted accounts open just because someone told you that you should.\"",
            "It is an issue of both utilization and average age of accounts. If your cards with $0 balances on them are: A) newer cards than the ones you are carrying balances on and you don't want them B) much lower limit cards than the ones you are carrying balances on then you can raise your score by closing them, as the utilization change won't be a large factor and you can raise the average age of your open accounts.",
            "In your specific case, I would leave them open unless you have a specific reason for wanting to close them - particularly, unless you feel closing them is necessary for you to not misuse them. The impact on the credit score is not why I say this, though.  Much more important are the two competing real factors: My suggestion would be to take the cards and put them in your file cabinet, or whatever would cause you to not use them.  In fact, you could even cut them up but not close the accounts - I had an account open that I didn't possess a physical card for several years for and didn't use at all, and it stayed open (though it's not guaranteed they'll keep it open for you if you never use it).   In an emergency you could then ask them to send you a new copy of the card very easily.  But, keep them, just in case you need them. Once you have paid off your balances on your balance-carrying cards, then you should consider closing some of them.  Keep enough to be able to live for ~4-6 months (a similar amount to the ideal rainy day fund in savings, basically) and then close others, particularly if you can do so in a way that keeps your average account age reasonably stable.",
            "In my own case, my credit score went up drastically after I closed cards.  It did go down a bit (like 10 points) in the short term.  Within 6 months, however, I did see significant gains.  This would include closing the American Express card that I had for like 10 years.  According much of what I read, you should never close a AMEX card.   I did and it did not hurt me. What helps all this is that my utilization is zero.",
            "There is also security aspect. By reducing the number of active credit/debit cards, one significantly reduces the surface of attack. There is smaller chance of getting one of your card information stolen and misused (cf Target data leaks and others).",
            "There's no harm in keeping them open.  Like you said, closing the lines will potentially hurt your utilization.  The extent of that impact will depend on your particular situation.   There are situations where closing a line will have no actual impact on your utilization.  If you have 100k of open credit and a debt load of $2k, if you close a $10k line you won't really have an issue because your utilization is 2% and closing the line will take you to 2.2%.",
            "Assuming that a person has good financial discipline and is generally responsible with spending, I think that having a few hundred or thousand dollars extra of available credit is usually worth more to that person for the choice/flexibility it provides in unforeseen circumstance, versus the relatively minor hit that could be taken to their credit score.",
            "I'm not sure if someone else answered already in the same manner I will. I can't guarantee for sure if it's the same in the U.S.A. (it might since major credit cards companies like Visa/MC/AMEX are American companies) but in Canada having/keeping unused CC is a disadvantage because of the following: Banks and financing companies look more at the total amount of credit available to you than at how much purchases you have on your cards. Ex: Let's say that you have the following: - Visa cc with $10,000 limit and $2000 worth of purchases (made more than 30 days ago) on it. - Mastercard cc with $10,000 limit as well and $1000 worth of purchases (less than 30 days old) - A major retail store cc with $2000 limit and $0 balance. Hypothetical situation: You want a bank loan to do some expensive house repairs and are looking for a lower interest rate than what your cc can offer. The bank will not care about the amount on the cards. They will add-up all the limits of your cc and treat your loan request as if ALL your cards were filled to their respective limit.  So in this case: they will consider you as being right now in debt of $10K+$10K+$2K = $22,000 instead of only $3000 and they might:  1. refuse you the loan 2. grant it only if you transfer all purchases on a single card and cancel all the others. 3. Once the $3000 is transferred on one of the cards (and the others cancelled), they can require that you reduce the limit of that card. Hope this helps!",
            "\"The only good reason I find to close cards are: it's a card with an annual fee that you don't need.  No point bleeding money each year. churning rewards.  Open card to get bonus promotion such as \"\"spend $500 in first 3 months, get $200 bonus\"\".  Close card and open a year later to do that same bonus again if available.  Many cards don't allow you to do this. making room for newer cards at the same bank.  Example, you have 5 Chase Cards and you want to apply for a 6th.  Chase says you have maximized your credit they will extend you.  You close one of your existing cards to get that new card. I have seen that many banks allow you to shift over some over your existing available credit to your new card without having to close them.\"",
            "Credit scoring has changed recently and the answer to this question will have slightly changed. While most points made here are true: But now (as of July 2017) it is possible having a large available credit balance can negatively effect your credit score directly:  ... VantageScore will now mark a borrower negatively for having   excessively large credit card limits, on the theory that the person   could run up a high credit card debt quickly.

            "\"I'd say close them if they have fees, if you're worried about fraud or if you're going to be tempted to use them. It may have an affect on your credit rating, but it shouldn't hurt you seriously. Having too many cards gives you the \"\"opportunity\"\" to overspend, which obviously isn't good.\"",
            "You mentioned you have a bunch of credit cards with no balance, while others have fairly high balances I would not recommend you to close the 0 balance credit cards if they have lower APR. You can transfer the balance to those cards with lower APR. Now, if those 0 balance cards do not have lower APR, closing them will reduce my overall balance and hurt my credit rating and that is true, assume that you mean overall credit line instead of overall balance. But to my understanding, if you keep the payments good and on time, that effect is only temporary, and therefore you can definitely close them.  Don't forget, paying off your balance can also lower your utilization rate and therefore increase your credit ratings, and you can focus more on that instead. Also larger number of accounts with amounts owed can indicate higher risk of over-extension, therefore you should pay off your low balance accounts first, and do not open new credit accounts until you have paid off the current balance."

        "answer": "Options that are not worth exercising simply expire. However, options that are worth exercising are usually exercised automatically as they expire. This results in a transfer of stock between the entity that issued the option and the entity that holds it. Specifically, OCC options automatically exercise upon expiration if the value of the option exceeds the transaction cost for the stock transfer, which can range from 1/4 point to 3/4 point depending on the situation . If an option is \"out of the money\" at the time of expiration, it will expire worthless.

            "\"Firstly \"\"Most option traders don't want to actually buy or sell the underlying stock.\"\" THIS IS COMPLETELY UTTERLY FALSE Perhaps the problem is that you are only familiar with the BUY side of options trading. On the sell side of options trading, an options desk engages in DELTA HEDGING. When we sell an option to a client. We will also buy an appropriate amount of underlying to match the delta position of the option. During the life time of the option. We will readjust our hedge position whenever the delta changes (those who follow Black Scholes will know that normally that comes from (underlying) price changes). However, we lose money on each underlying change (we have to cross the bid-ask spread for each trade). That is why we lose money when there is volatility. That is why we are said to be \"\"short VEGA\"\" or \"\"short volatility\"\". So one way to think about \"\"buying\"\" options, is that you are paying someone to execute a specific trading strategy. In general, those who sell options, are also happy to buy options back (at a discount of course, so we make a profit). But when doing so, we need to unroll our hedging position, and that again incurs a cost (to us, the bank). Finally. Since this is \"\"money\"\" stackexchange rather than finance. You are most likely referring to \"\"warrants\"\" rather than \"\"options\"\", which are listed on stock exchanges. The exchange in most regions give us very specific and restrictive regulations that we must abide by. One very common one is that we MUST always list a price which we are willing to buy the warrants back at (which may not be an unreasonable spread from the sell price). Since an Option is a synthetically created investment instrument, when we buy back the Option from the investor, we simply unwind the underlying hedging positions that we booked to synthesize the Options with.

        "question": "How does stabilization work during an IPO?",
        "answer": "Stabilization during an IPO works through a mechanism where the underwriter acts as a stabilizing agent. After an initial public offering (IPO), the underwriter may have obligations to support the trading of the share for a certain period. This support often takes the form of repurchasing some of the shares if the IPO is performing poorly. Additionally, there is an overallotment pool that comes into play during an IPO, where clients can receive more shares than those issued by the company, with the extra shares coming from the underwriter, effectively making the underwriter short by a certain number of shares.\n\nTo manage the risk associated with this overallotment, the underwriter is granted a greenshoe option by the clients. This greenshoe option allows the underwriter to buy back the oversold shares at the IPO price, thus protecting the underwriter from market exposure. If the share price falls after the IPO, the underwriter can profit by buying back the shares at a lower market price. Conversely, if the share price goes up, the company can exercise the greenshoe option to purchase shares at the IPO price through the overallotment pool to cover the underwriter's short position and prevent a loss .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"There are no \"\"rules\"\" about how the price should act after an IPO, so there are no guarantee that a \"\"pop\"\" would appear at the opening day. But when an IPO is done, it's typically underpriced. On average, the shares are 10% up at the end of the first day after the IPO (I don't have the source that, I just remember that from some finance course). Also, after the IPO, the underwriter can be asked to support the trading of the share for a certain period of time. That is the so called stabilizing agent. They have few obligations like: This price support in often done by a repurchase of some of the shares of poorly performing IPO. EDIT: Informations about the overallotment pool. When the IPO is done, a certain number of client buy the shares issued by the company. The underwriter, with the clients, can decide to create an overallotment pool, where the clients would get a little more shares (hence \"\"overallotment\"\"), but this time the shares are not issued by the company but by the underwriter. To put it another way, the underwriter oversell and becomes short by a certain number of shares (limited to 15% of the IPO). In exchange for the risk taken by this overallotment, the underwriter gets a greenshoe option from the clients, that will allows the underwriter to buy back the oversold shares, at the price of the IPO, from the clients. The idea behind this option is to avoid a market exposure for the underwriter. So, after the IPO: If the price goes down, the underwriter buys back on the market the overshorted shares and makes a profits. If the price goes up, the company exercise the greenshoe option buy the shares at the IPO prices (throught the overallotment pool, that is, the additional shares that the clients wanted ) to avoid suffering a loss.\"",
            "\"IPO's are priced so that there's a pop\"\" on the opening day.\"\" If I were IPOing my company and the price \"\"popped\"\" on the open, I would think the underwriter priced it too low. In fact if I were to IPO, I'd seek an underwriter whose offerings consistently traded on the first day pretty unchanged. That means they priced it correctly. In the 90's IPO boom, there were stocks that opened up 3X and more. The original owners must have been pretty upset as the poor pricing guidance the underwriter offered.\""

        "question": "Lost credit card replaced with new card and new numbers. Credit score affected?",
        "answer": "The replacement of a lost credit card with a new card and new numbers generally does not have a direct impact on your credit score, as long as the account remains the same and the payment history continues uninterrupted. When a credit card is lost or stolen, the account number is usually changed to prevent fraudulent charges, but the credit card issuer links the new account number to the same credit account. This means that the account history, credit limit, and payment history should carry over to the new card number.\n\nCredit scores are calculated based on factors such as payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, new credit, and types of credit used. As long as you continue to make payments on time, keep your credit utilization low, and the issuer reports the account with its history unchanged to the credit bureaus, your credit score should not be affected.\n\nDo you need specific information regarding credit score guidelines from a document you have, or is this general information sufficient for your inquiry?",

The new account should have the old open date, so you should retain your payment history, he says. The credit limit and balance should also stay the same. http://blog.credit.com/2014/02/lost-or-stolen-credit-card-hurt-your-credit-scores-76724/ How Issuers Report Replacement Cards We asked the major card issuers how they report replacement cards to credit reporting agencies: American Express: The new card has the same open date and \u201cMember Since\u201d year as the previous card. The balance on the old account number is transferred to the new account number. All payment history transfers over. Bank of America: All transactions and account history are transferred to the new account number when there is a card replacement or renewal.

        "question": "How can all these countries owe so much money?  Why & where did they borrow it from?",
        "answer": "Countries can owe large amounts of money for a variety of reasons. The debt is typically owed to individuals and institutions that purchase debt instruments, such as bonds. Governments issue these instruments as a way to borrow money, which they may use to finance various expenditures exceeding their revenue, much like an individual spending more than they earn and taking out loans or using credit cards to cover the gap.\n\nCountries don't just borrow from other countries; debt can be owned by a mix of domestic and international investors, including foreign governments' central banks, mutual funds, pension funds, private individuals, and other entities. For instance, in the US, about one-third of the debt is held by foreigners, roughly half by the Federal Reserve, and the rest by American organizations.\n\nAdditionally, governments, like the US federal government in recent years, may also fund their borrowings through mechanisms like money printing, which is termed \"quantitative easing.\" They continue servicing their debt by paying interest and refinancing old debt through new debt issuances.\n\nIn terms of the scale of this debt, it is often comparable to, or less than, a country's annual GDP. For example, the US's total wealth is far greater than its debt, being in the neighborhood of 50 trillion dollars. The notion that all countries cannot collectively owe more money than exists is incorrect because there is an enormous amount of wealth globally to sustain this borrowing and lending system .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"They borrowed it from the people, and typically to finance wars and military spending. For example, Wikipedia suggests that the Bank of England \"\"was set up to supply money to the King. \u00a31.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the Navy.\"\" It's a game that everyone has to play once started; if Napoleon buys an army on credit, you'll have to raise an equal amount or face quite a problem. As for why they've grown so large, it's because governments are quite skilled at owing large sums of money. Only a small portion of the debt comes due in full at a given moment, and they constantly reissue new debt via auction to keep it rolling. So as long as they can make coupon (interest) and the lump sum at maturity, it's not difficult to keep up. Imagine how much credit card debt you could rack up if you only ever had to pay interest. This game will continue for as long as people lend. And there are plenty of lenders. There's pensions, mutual funds and endowments, which find public debt typically safer than stocks. And money market funds, which target 1 dollar NAV and only invest in the \"\"safest\"\" AAA-rated bonds to protect it. There's central banks, which can buy and sell public debt to manipulate inflation and exchange rates.  Absent some kind of UN resolution to ban lending, or perhaps a EU mandated balanced budget, these debts will likely continue to grow. You think they \"\"collectively owe more money than can exist\"\", but there's a lot of wealth in the world. Most nations owe less than a year's GDP. For example, the US's total wealth is in the neighborhood of 50 trillion.\"",
            "By the phrasing of your question it seems that you are under the mistaken impression that countries are borrowing money from other countries, in which case it would make sense to question how everyone can be a borrower with no one on the other side of the equation. The short answer is that the debt is owed mostly to individuals and institutions that buy debt instruments. For example, you know those US savings bonds that parents are buying to save for their children's education? Well a bond is just a way to loan money to the Government in exchange for the original money plus some interest back later. It is as simple as that. I think because the debt and the deficit are usually discussed in the context of more complex macroeconomic concerns people often mistakenly assume that national debts are denominated in some shadow banking system that is hidden from the common person behind some red-tape covered bureaucracy. This is not the case here. Why did they get themselves into this much debt? The same reason the average person does, they are spending more than they bring in and are enabled by access to easy credit. Like many people they are also paying off one credit card using another one.",
            "\"Others have pointed out that the entities loaning money to the government are typically people and institutions.  Recently, however, the US federal government borrowings were largely funded by money printed by the Federal Reserve.  The government had to borrow $1.1 trillion from October, 2010 through June, 2011.  During this period the FED printed around $0.8 trillion new dollars to purchase US debt.  Thus, the US government was not borrowing money from people, it was being funded by money printing.  The central bankers call this \"\"quantitative easing\"\".\"",
            "Here is an overview of who owns US Debt from Wikipedia, it indicates that approximately 1/3rd of US debt is held by foreigners (mainly the central banks of other countries), approximately 1/2 of US Debt is held by the federal reserve, and the rest is owned by various America organizations (mutual funds, pension funds, etc).

        "question": "To pay off a student loan, should I save up a lump sum payoff payment or pay extra each month?",
        "answer": "Whether you should save up for a lump sum payoff or pay extra each month towards your student loan debt depends on various factors, including the terms of your loan, your financial situation, and your personal preferences towards debt and savings.\n\nThe document I found mentions a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Loan Terms and Interest Rates**: If you have loans with high-interest rates, it generally makes sense to pay them off as quickly as possible, as you'll save on interest costs in the long run. If the interest rate on your student loan is low and you have other debt with higher rates, it might be better to focus on the higher-rate debt first .\n\n2. **Emergency Savings**: Having some savings is important for financial security, so you might prefer to maintain a balance between paying off debt and saving. In case you lose your job or have an unexpected expense, having a cash reserve can provide a safety net without the need to rely on your loan as a fallback .\n\n3. **Loan Forgiveness Programs**: If you're eligible for a student loan forgiveness program, it may not make sense to pay off your loans early, as you may have the remaining balance forgiven after a certain period if you meet the qualifications .\n\n4. **Psychological Benefits**: There can be emotional benefits to paying off debt, as it can be gratifying not to owe money to anyone, which may factor into your decision-making process .\n\n5. **Investment vs. Loan Repayment**: If you can earn a higher return on your investments than the interest rate on your student loan debt, it might make more financial sense to invest rather than to pay off your loan quickly .\n\n6. **Early Payment Penalties**: Check if there are any penalties for paying off your loan early. Some lenders charge a settlement fee to compensate for the interest they lose when you pay off your loan ahead of schedule .\n\nUltimately, the decision should be made based on an analysis of your financial situation and priorities. It might be beneficial to consult with a financial adviser to determine the best strategy for your specific circumstances.",

I wrote a lengthy article on this in response to a friend who had a loan, but was also pondering a home purchase in the future. Student Loans and Your First Mortgage discusses the math behind one's ability to put a downpayment on a house vs having that monthly cash to pay towards the mortgage. In your case, the question is whether, in 5 years, the $8500 would be best spent as a home down payment or to pay off the 6.8% loan.  If you specifically had plans toward home ownership, the timing of that plan would affect my answer here, as I discuss in the article.  The right answer to your question can only come by knowing far more of your personal situation.  Meanwhile, the plan comes at a cost. Your plan will get rid of the loan in about 5 years, but if you simply double up the payments, advising the servicing company to apply the extra to principal, it would drop to just a couple month over over 4. As you read more about personal finance, you'll find a lot of different views. Some people are fixated on having zero debt, others will focus on liquidity. In the end, you need to understand each approach and decide what's right for you.",
            "If the savings rate is the same as the loan rate, mathematically it doesn't make any difference whether you pay down the loan more and save less or vice versa. However, if the loan rate is higher than the savings rate it's better to pay it down as fast as possible. The chart below compares paying down the loan and saving equally (the gradual scenario), versus paying down the loan quickly at 2 x $193 and then saving 2 x $193.  The savings rate, for illustration, is 2%. Paying quickly pays down the loan completely by month 51.  On the other hand, in the gradual scheme the loan can't be paid down (with the savings) until month 54, which then leaves 3 months less for saving.  In conclusion, it's better to pay down the higher rate loan first.  Practically speaking, it may be useful to have some savings available.",
            "If you pay extra now you will pay less in interest over the life of the loan. Unless your savings account has a higher interest rate than the loan's rate you are not saving anything. That being said, you may have a greater need for savings due to other things (e.g. you might need a emergency fund). But if you are only saving for the loan: compare the rates to see if it is worth it.",
            "There are a few ways you can go about paying this off quickly (and safely): You could start paying $386 monthly (ie, double what you're paying now). You'll pay less interest in the long run because they can only charge you for the amount outstanding. Remember, 6.8% of $12k is more than 6.8% of $6k. However, your plan sounds more sensible. Say you get to $6k paid off and $6k saved, you're able to pay off what's left and that's almost $200 a month you'll have extra. Although what I like about this is - if you become ill, lose your job, or whatever, then you're still able make the $193 payments, PLUS you'll have money saved for day-to-day expenses (food, water, gas, electricity, etc.) long enough to see yourself through. PS. They may charge you a settlement fee because if you pay early then they miss out on money... but check your contract with them first. Hope this helps!",
            "As someone in the very same position as you here is what I suggest: Have $1,000 for each possible large expense you currently have. For example, house, car, pregnant wife, etc. As someone who only has a car (living at home still) I only have $1,000 in my eFund (emergency fund). The ABSOLUTE rest of my money goes to paying off the loans as soon as possible. I mean ever single dollar. There is no point for investing unless you have a really good return on investment. I am not too sure how common returns of 6.8% are, but that seems above average. If in fact you're just stashing it in a bank account at ~1%, you're doing it wrong.  Getting out of debt is not only just about the financial benefits but the emotional benefits too. It feels really nice to not owe anybody anything.  Good luck man!    P.S. Try using a tracker like ReadytoZero to show how much you're losing a day by remaining in debt. This will better help you understand if your investments are making you money or losing your money.",

Since student loans cannot be declared in bankruptcy and interest rates cannot be refinanced, or are nonnegotiable, then you should consider your student loan a priority in case your employment/income runs into problems.",

Years later, through his employer, he was able to apply for and receive a grant that paid off the remainder of his student loan. It was literally free money, and a significant amount, too. The windfall was a little bittersweet for him because he had been making extra payments over the years. The cap on the grant was something like $50k and he wasn't able to use all of it because he had been aggressive in paying it down. (Still, free money is free money.) Sure, this is a unique situation, but grants happen.",
            "Simply, you should put your money into whatever has the higher interest rate, savings or repayment of debt. Let's say at the beginning of month A you put $1000 into each account. In the case of the savings, at the end of month A you will have $1001.6 ($1000 + 1000 x 2% annual interest / 12) In the case of a loan, at the end of month A you will have $1005.7. ($17000 plus 6.8 interest for one month is 17096.3. On $16000, the new value is 16090.6.  The difference between these is $1005.7. 5.7 / 1.6 = 3.56 Therefore, using your money to repay your loan nets you a return about 3.5 times greater."

If you want to pay the mortgage down faster, make two half payments per month, and/or add a little extra to each payment (make sure with the bank that any extra will automatically go to principal).",
            "\"Jack \"\"The Mortgage Professor\"\" Guttentag provides a thorough analysis of a similar-sounding system: In addition, I had the feeling that customers of Mortgage Relief should have gotten a spreadsheet for their $45, and wondered why they hadn\u2019t? So I set out to develop a spreadsheet of my own that could quantify the benefits \u2013 if there were any. The major question I wanted the spreadsheet to answer was, how large is the benefit of using the Mortgage Relief scheme if you don\u2019t have any surplus income but only just enough to make the scheduled payment? This is the critical question because we know that if you use surplus income to make extra payments to principal, you pay down the mortgage more quickly. This is so whether you apply the income directly to the mortgage, as most borrowers do, or whether you follow the Mortgage Relief procedure where you use a credit line to pay down the mortgage and current income to pay down the credit line. I spent much of my air time between Philadelphia and San Francisco on this project, and finally gave it up. Once I removed surplus income from the equation, I could not find a way to make the Mortgage Relief scheme work. You may also want to read related articles by Guttentag:\"",
            "That makes no sense at all. They try to compare and that's exactly the same as comparing apples versus oranges. Mortgage is long-term loan, so for the first many years the huge part of the payment will go to repaying interest, so that ratio 1 will indeed be something like 20% or more despite the fact that the interest rate on the mortgage is much lower - something around 6%. HELOC will have the interest rate of 6%, but it will have the same structure so that you have equal payments, so if you compute that ratio 1 it will be very close to that of the mortgage. The bottom line is - if HELOCs were that great noone would apply for mortgages. You should stick to making extra payments towards the principal on the mortgage.",
            "\"This doesn't say the whole story (like the length of the HELOC). if you have 15 years left on a mortgage and \"\"refinance\"\" into a 30 year HELOC then yes, your payments maybe 20% lower, but you add 15 years to pay it off.  Just remember that interest occurs daily on what you owe. If you move 100K of debt from 5% mortgage to 6% HELOC you'll be paying more to the banks no matter how you slice it.\"",
            "Sounds fishy - taking out more debt to pay the main mortgage down faster? There are a couple of issues I can see: I would think that a much more sensible strategy with a lot less risk is to save up extra cash and send your lender a check every quarter or six months.",
            "\"I think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized, you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan. A HELOC accrues interest like a credit card, so if you make a large principal payment using a HELOC, you will be able to retire those \"\"chunks\"\" of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments. I haven't worked out the numbers, but I suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead -- making even one extra payment per year will take 7-9 years off of a 30 year loan. I think that the advantage of the HELOC approach is that if you borrow enough, you may be able to recalculate/lower the payment of the mortgage.\""

For an individual becoming eligible for Social Security benefits or disability benefits in 2013 or who dies in 2013 before becoming eligible, the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is calculated as follows:\n\n1. 90 percent of the first $791 of average indexed monthly earnings,\n2. plus 32 percent of average indexed monthly earnings over $791 and through $4,768,\n3. plus 15 percent of average indexed monthly earnings over $4,768.\n\nThis example rate is for 2013, and to calculate future benefits you'll need to project your average indexed monthly earnings and make assumptions regarding the bend points (the earnings thresholds in the PIA formula) and inflation. You will also need to consider the Contribution and Benefit Base, which caps the earnings used to calculate contributions and benefits.\n\nTo adjust for early or late retirement, an early or late retirement factor is required. The benefits are increased annually based on changes in the cost of living.\n\nPerforming these calculations by hand can be complex and is not considered fun by many. A more practical alternative for many people is to use the Social Security Benefit Calculator provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which includes the source code for the calculator. This tool can help automate the process and give you an estimate of your benefits.\n\nIt is also recommended to check your Social Security estimates regularly using the SSA's online tool, which shows the amounts you've paid into Social Security and Medicare, along with estimated benefits. This can be particularly useful for catching and correcting any discrepancies in your recorded earnings .\n\nFor a personalized estimate and to access the Social Security Benefit Calculator, visit the SSA's official website.",

            "\"Some details in case you are interested: Being a defined benefit kind of pension plan, the formula for your Social Security benefits isn't tied directly to FICA contributions, and I'm not aware of any calculator that performs an ROI based on FICA contributions. Rather, how much you'll get in retirement is based on your average indexed monthly earnings.  Here's some information on the Social Security calculation from the Social Security Administration - Primary Insurance Amount (PIA): For an individual who first becomes eligible for old-age insurance   benefits or disability insurance benefits in 2013, or who dies in 2013   before becoming eligible for benefits, his/her PIA will be the sum of:       (a) 90 percent of the first $791 of his/her average indexed monthly earnings, plus       (b) 32 percent of his/her average indexed monthly earnings over $791 and through $4,768, plus       (c) 15 percent of his/her average indexed monthly earnings over $4,768. Here's an example.  Of course, to calculate a benefit in the future, you'll need to calculate projected average indexed monthly earnings; more details here.  You'll also need to make assumptions about what those bend points might be in the future.  The average wage indexing values for calculating the AIME are available from the Social Security Administration's site, but future indexing values will also need to be projected based on an assumption about their inflation.  You'll also need to project the Contribution and Benefit Base which limits the earnings used to calculate contributions and benefits. Also, the PIA calculation assumes benefits are taken at the normal retirement age.  Calculating an early or late retirement factor is required to adjust benefits for another age.  Then, whatever benefits you get will increase each year, because the benefit is increased based on annual changes in the cost of living. Performing the series of calculations by hand isn't my idea of fun, but implementing it as a spreadsheet (or a web page) and adding in some \"\"ROI based on FICA contributions\"\" calculations might be an interesting exercise if you are so inclined?

            "There has been an abundance of articles in recent years which make it fairly clear that many participants in the Social Security system-- especially those who have started contributing recently, and going forward from that-- will experience negative rates of return.

That actual loss does not even consider the opportunity cost, what   workers might have earned if they had been able to invest their taxes   in real assets that yield a positive return. In fact, a study by   financial analyst William Shipman demonstrates that, if a 25-year-old   worker were able to privately invest the money he or she currently   pays in Social Security taxes, the worker would receive retirement   benefits three to six times higher than under Social Security.

        "question": "What is the best way to help my dad consolidate his credit card debt at a lower rate?",
        "answer": "There are several strategies to consider for consolidating your dad's credit card debt at a lower rate:\n\n1. Personal Loan: One option is to take out a personal loan, use it to pay off the credit card debt, and then focus on repaying the loan, which could have a lower interest rate than the credit card. This approach works well if you're paying a set amount close to the minimum each month on the credit card debt .\n\n2. Balance Transfer Credit Card: If your dad has good credit, opening a new credit card with a low or 0% introductory APR for balance transfers can be beneficial. After transferring the balance, it's crucial to pay off the debt within the promotional period to avoid accruing interest. However, be aware of any balance transfer fees, which usually range from 3-5% .\n\n3. Debt Consolidation Loan: Your dad's bank or a credit union might consider a debt consolidation loan, especially if you're willing to co-sign the loan. This demonstrates responsibility and reduces credit risk. Note that consolidating the debt into a loan helps reduce interest charges and provides a fixed payment, making it easier to manage the repayment .\n\n4. Peer-to-Peer Lending: Platforms like Lending Club can facilitate loans where instead of one bank financing the loan, it is split across multiple investors. These loans can have rates between 5-30%, based on your dad's credit profile .\n\nIt's essential to treat debt as an emergency and focus on paying it off as soon as possible. Moreover, having a plan for debt reduction will positively affect your dad's credit score and might improve his ability to get approved for a mortgage .\n\nRemember to assess all options carefully and consider your dad's financial situation and ability to repay the debt before making a decision. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to ensure that the chosen strategy aligns with his overall financial goals.",

Will you get approved for a $30,000 unsecured loan? You don't mention your credit rating but that will have an effect obviously. You might consider visiting a credit union with your father and co-signing a loan since it is his debt that you are assuming. You might still want to write a loan for your dad to sign even if he isn't co-signed on a loan. This could protect you in case of his death if there are other assets to divide. If you are not approved for a loan, you could also simply join your dad in paying down the highest-rate cards first and have a loan agreement for him to pay back that money if/when it is possible. You've mentioned that you have no collateral. There aren't many options for loans with no collateral. Your dad's bank or a credit union might consider a debt consolidation loan with you as a co-signer. That's why I mentioned going to a credit union. Talking to a loan officer at a local financial institution will make it easier to get approved. If they see that you are taking responsible steps to pay off the debt, that reduces your credit risk. If you do get a debt consolidation loan, they will probably ask your dad to close some credit card accounts.",
            "I agree with you that you need to consolidate this debt using a loan. It may be hard to find a bank or credit organization that will give you an unsecured personal loan for that much money.  I know of one, called Lending Club (Disclaimer - I'm an investor on this platform. Not trying to advertise, it's just the only place I know of off the top of my head) that facilitates loans like this, but instead of a bank financing the loan, the loan is split up accross hundreds of investors who each contribute a small amount (such as $25). They have rates anywhere between 5-30%, based on your credit profile(s), and I believe they have some loan amounts that go up to the area that you're discussing.  Regarding buying the house - The best thing you can do when trying to buy a house is to save up a 20% downpayment, if at all possible. Below this amount, you may be asked to pay for 'PMI' - Private Mortgage Insurance. This is a charge that doesn't go away for quite a while (until you've paid them 20% of the appraised value of the home), where you pay a premium because you didn't have the 20% downpayment for the house.  I would suggest you try to eliminate your credit card debt as soon as possible, and would recommend the same for your father. Getting your utilization down and reconsolidating the large debts with a loan will help to reduce interest charges and get you a reasonable, fixed payment.  Whether you decide to pay off your own balances using your savings account is up to you; if it were me, personally, I'd do so immediately rather than trying to pay it off over time. But if you lose money to taxes by withdrawing the money from your 'tax free savings account', it may not be a beneficial situation.  Treat debt, especially credit card debt, like an emergency at all times, and you'll find yourself in a better place as a result.  Credit card debt and balances are and should be temporary, and their rates and fees are structured that way. If, for any reason, you expect that a credit card's balance will remain for an extended period of time, you may want to consider whether it would be advantageous for you to consolidate the debt into a loan, instead."

Here's a summary of the key points regarding the settlement:\n\n1. **T+3 Settlement Rules**: If you're assigned on your short option, you generally have 3 days to deliver the stock. Your broker will notify you and may even threaten to liquidate assets in your account to cover costs if you don't comply .\n\n2. **Utilizing the Long Leg of the Spread**: If you still hold the long leg of the calendar spread, you can obtain the necessary stock by exercising your long call. This depends on whether you have sufficient funds or not. If you plan to exercise the long call to cover your assigned short call, you should check with your broker to determine how quickly the stock will be credited to your account, as there is also a settlement timeline for the exercise process. There's a risk that the stock may not be credited quickly enough, especially if actions are taken on the third day of the settlement period .\n\n3. **Significance of the Far Date Call**: The call option with the farther expiration date acts as \"insurance\" against large adverse moves in the underlying stock price that could lead to assignment. It's vital to ensure your strategy can cover obligations under all scenarios, particularly because in IRAs, for example, you can't contribute new cash at any time, and usually, brokers place additional restrictions on trades within IRAs .\n\n4. **Potential for Violations in Cash Accounts**: If you are assigned on your short call in a cash account, you could potentially face good faith, cash liquidation, or free riding violations, depending on how you deliver the stock and other activities in the same account .\n\nKeep in mind that the specifics of option settlements can vary based on the broker's policies and the account type (e.g., IRA vs. regular cash account).

The Market Makers are institutions that are there to provide liquidity so that investors can easily buy and sell shares at a \"\"fair\"\" price. Market Makers need to have on hand a suitable supply of shares to meet investor demands.  When Market Makers feel the need to either increase or decrease their supply of a particular security quickly, they turn to the Dealer Market. In order to participate in a Dealer Market, you must be designated a Market Maker.  As noted already, Market Makers are dedicated to providing liquidity for the Auction Market in certain securities and therefore require that they have on hand a suitable supply of those securities which they support.  For example, if a Market Maker for Apple shares is low on their supply of Apple shares, then will go the Dealer Market to purchase more Apple shares.  Conversely, if they are holding what they feel are too many Apple shares, they will go to the Dealer Market to sell Apple shares.  The Dealer Market does operate on a bid-ask basis, contrary to your stated understanding. The bid-ask prices quoted on the Dealer Market are more or less identical to those on the Auction Market, except the quote sizes will be generally much larger. This is the case because otherwise, why would a Market Maker offer to sell shares to another Market Maker at a price well below what they could themselves sell them for in the Auction Market.  (And similarly with buy orders.)  If Market Makers are generally holding low quantities of a particular security, this will drive up the price in both the Dealer Market and the Auction Market.

If you trade with unsettled funds in a cash account and then try to use those funds before the settlement period is completed, you might run into a good faith violation.\n\nHaving a margin account also comes with other rules, such as the Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule if you make four or more day trades within 5 business days, requiring you to maintain a minimum balance of $25,000 in your account. If you don't meet these requirements, you risk having your account frozen or downgraded to a cash account. It's important to understand the limitations of your account type, whether it's a cash account or a margin account, and to trade accordingly to avoid potential issues.\n\nFor a comprehensive explanation from the document, you can look up the section titled \"Trading with Settled / Unsettled Funds\" in the file named fiqa_doc.txt .",

            "\"The issues of trading with unsettled funds are usually restricted to cash accounts.  With margin, I've never personally heard of a rule that will catch you in this scenario.  You won't be able to withdraw funds that are tied up in unsettled positions until the positions settle.  You should be able to trade those funds.  I've never heard of a broker charging margin interest on unsettled funds, but that doesn't mean there isn't a broker somewhere that does. Brokers are allowed to impose their own restrictions, however, since margin is basically offering you a line of credit.  You should check to see if your broker has more restrictive rules. I'd guess that you may have heard about restrictions that apply to cash accounts and think they may also apply to margin accounts.  If that's the case and you want to learn more about the rules generally, try searching for these terms: You should be able to find a lot of clear resources on those terms.  Here's one that's current and provides examples: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/avoiding-cash-trading-violations On a margin account you avoid these issue because the margin (essentially a loan from your broker) provides a cushion / additional funds that avoid the issues.

        "question": "Advice on strategy for when to sell",
        "answer": "When deciding when to sell stocks, it's important to have a strategy in place. Here are some guidelines gathered from the document reviewed:\n\n1. Set an exit strategy for every stock you buy. This should include a maximum loss and maximum gain. When it hits that target, sell or make a conscious decision to buy it again at the current price .\n   \n2. Keep a diary. Write down why you are buying the stock, how long you plan to keep it, and under what circumstances you would sell it .\n\n3. Understand market liquidity. There will always be a price you can sell at, even during market crashes, though the price may be less favorable. Long-term investors often find holding on is the best strategy, as every historical crash has more than recovered over time .\n\n4. Dispelling a common misconception: For every seller, there is a buyer, even during crashes and corrections. When a stock is falling, it is often because potential buyers are lowering the price they are willing to pay, not necessarily exiting the market .\n\nBefore making any decisions, ensure that your actions align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Had I just kept the shares till now, no sales, I'd have 14,000 shares of Apple worth $1.68M dollars.  $130K for an initial $10,000 investment is nothing to complain about, but yes, taking a profit can be the wrong thing. 25%? Was that all the potential the company had?  There's one question to ask, not where is the price today compared to last year or two years ago, but what are the company's prospects. Is the reason I bought them still valid? Look at your investment each quarter as if you were making the decision that day. I agree, diversification is important, so the choice is only hold or sell, not to buy more of a good company, because there are others out there, and the one sane thing Cramer says that everyone should adhere to is to not put your eggs in one basket.",
            "\"It's impossibly difficult to time the market. Generally speaking, you should buy low and sell high. Picking 25% as an arbitrary ceiling on your gains seems incorrect to me because sometimes you'll want to hold a stock for longer or sell it sooner, and those decisions should be based on your research (or if you need the money), not an arbitrary number. To answer your questions: If the reasons you still bought a stock in the first place are still valid, then you should hold and/or buy more. If something has changed and you can't find a reason to buy more, then consider selling. Keep in mind you'll pay capital gains taxes on anything you sell that is not in a tax-deferred (e.g. retirement) account. No, it does not make sense to do a wash sale where you sell and buy the same stock. Capital gains taxes are one reason. I'm not sure why you would ever want to do this -- what reasons were you considering? You can always sell just some of the shares. See above (and link) regarding wash sales. Buying more of a stock you already own is called \"\"dollar cost averaging\"\". It's an effective method when the reasons are right. DCA minimizes variance due to buying or selling a large amount of shares at an arbitrary single-day price and instead spreads the cost or sale basis out over time.

        "answer": "Deep in the money options tend to have very low liquidity because they are less volatile. Since option traders often seek volatility to achieve higher returns (often being more open to risk-taking), the lower volatility associated with deep in the money options makes them less attractive to these traders. Consequently, other market participants who use options also have limited use for deep in the money options, resulting in decreased trading activity and therefore reduced liquidity.",

Option traders aren't exactly risk averse (read: are degenerate gamblers) and the other market participants that use options don't have much use for deep in the money options.

At-the-money options, and at-the-money options strategies have hundreds and thousand percent payoffs on relatively mundane price changes in the underlying asset.",

Combine with a deep OTM Jan 2017 $70 strike put for $188, would give a $3400 margin requirement to enter the trade. or I could be in the JAN 2017 $70 strike for nearer $5800, but with a 100% margin requirement due to being a long call. So (3400/5800) = 59% increase in margin requirement for Deep ITM calls. Plus long term the shares will pay dividends, while a LEAP CALL does not."

        "question": "Trading on exchanges or via brokerage companies?",
        "answer": "Based on the document you've uploaded, here are some insights into trading on exchanges versus via brokerage companies:\n\n1. **Trading through Brokerage Companies**: Retail investors typically cannot trade directly through an exchange. Instead, they trade indirectly by placing an order with a broker who sends it to the exchange on their behalf. Brokerage companies act as intermediaries for investors and may offer additional services such as trading tools, investment advice, and access to various exchanges.\n\n2. **Trading on Exchanges Directly**: While there are some cons and pros of trading on exchanges directly, it's generally not an option for individual investors. To trade on an exchange directly, one would need to be registered with that exchange, which involves costs and may have limitations on who can register. Moreover, some exchanges may offer electronic trading on their websites, but this accessibility can vary. Not all stocks are available on every exchange; some may be listed only on specific ones.\n\n3. **Brokerage Types**: For beginners, it might be advisable to start with a discount broker. More sophisticated investors might opt for full-service brokers. When it comes to choosing, you should consider what services and tools are important to you, such as mobile apps or advanced trading platforms.\n\n4. **Choosing an Exchange**: The choice of an exchange usually depends on where you are located and where the particular stocks you are interested in are listed. For example, Apple's stock is listed on NASDAQ, so trades involving Apple shares would go through NASDAQ.\n\n5. **Broker-Dealer Firms**: A broker may not only represent investors on exchanges but may also buy and sell stocks for their own account, which is known as a broker-dealer firm.\n\n6. **Costs and Savings**: Using brokers might involve more costs or expenses paid to them. However, the registration and possibly other requirements to trade directly on an exchange may make it less cost-effective or even not viable for individual investors .\n\nIn conclusion, for most individual investors, using brokerage companies is the standard and often the only practical way to trade. Direct trading on exchanges is usually more suited for institutional investors or individuals who can meet the registration and financial requirements. When selecting a brokerage, consider your investment needs, the tools and services provided, and the fees involved. Always conduct research or consult with a financial adviser to determine the best approach for your trading and investment objectives.",

BATS allows membership but it is only for  Your firm must be a registered broker-dealer, registered with a Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) and connected with a clearing firm. No apple (aapl) is listed on the NASDAQ so trades go through the NASDAQ for aapl. Caterpillar Inc (CAT) is listed on the NYSE so trades go through the NYSE.  The exchange you trade on is dependent on the security, if it is listed on the NYSE then you trade on the NYSE. As a regular investor you will be going through a broker. When looking to purchase a security it is more important to know about the company and less important to know what exchange it is listed on. Since there are rules a company must comply with for it to be listed on certain exchanges, it does make a difference but that is more the case when speaking about a stock listed Over the Counter(OTC) or NYSE. It is not important when asking NYSE or NASDAQ? Selecting a broker is something that's dependent on your needs.

Yes, but to trade directly on an exchange, you need to register with them. That costs money and only a limited number of people can register I believe.

For brokerage companies, a beginner can go with discount broker. For sophisticated investors can opt for full service brokers. Usually your bank will have a brokerage firm.

        "question": "Does it make sense to trade my GOOGL shares for GOOG and pocket the difference?",
        "answer": "Trading your GOOGL shares for GOOG with the intention of pocketing the difference might be appealing, especially if there's a noticeable price discrepancy. However, there are several factors to consider before making such a decision. Here's a brief analysis of the situation based on the provided document.\n\nThe value of GOOGL and GOOG shares largely converges over time due to the practice of arbitrage, and their only differences lie in voting rights and potential dividend payouts which are generally expected to be the same. The settlement payoff might influence the valuation, but this is subject to change and could be uncertain. GOOGL shares have voting rights, but given that the control of the company decisions lies with the non-traded Class B shares, the value of GOOGL's voting rights is considered virtually zero for now.\n\nIn an ideal situation where dividends are equal and market prices align, someone who doesn't value the voting rights might prefer owning GOOG over GOOGL, as there is the potential of a future settlement payoff that could be substantial. Yet, this payoff is uncertain and would require the GOOG stock to be worth less than a certain percentage of GOOGL on the payoff determination date.\n\nThe document suggests that if the difference in pricing between GOOGL and GOOG shares is minimal (less than 3-4%), the advice is to leave the portfolio as is rather than engage in arbitrage. This is because the potential gain might not be worth the effort and complexities involved in managing your portfolio for such a small difference .\n\nNow, if the price difference is significant, and you have a considerable holding, then it may be worthwhile to perform a detailed analysis to assess whether the arbitrage could be profitable. But this also introduces various risks, including the fluctuating nature of settlements and the possibility that the expected payoff may never occur if the predetermined conditions aren't met.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be based on a careful evaluation of your investment strategy, the current market conditions, whether you value the voting rights, and your risk tolerance. If you're still unsure, consulting with a financial advisor who has a full view of your financial situation and goals may be beneficial.",

            "\"To keep it simple, let's say that A shares trade at 500 on average between April 2nd 2014 and April 1st 2015 (one year anniversary), then if C shares trade on average: The payment will be made either in cash or in shares within 90 days. The difficulties come from the fact that the formula is based on an average price over a year, which is not directly tradable, and that the spread is only covered between 1% and 5%. In practice, it is unlikely that the market will attribute a large premium to voting shares considering that Page&Brin keep the majority and any discount of Cs vs As above 2-3% (to include cost of trading + borrowing) will probably trigger some arbitrage which will prevent it to extend too much. But there is no guarantee. FYI here is what the spread has looked like since April 3rd:  * details in the section called \"\"Class C Settlement Agreement\"\" in the S-3 filing\"",
            "It appears very possible that Google will not have to pay any class C holders the settlement amount, given the structure of the settlement.  This is precisely because of the arbitrage opportunity you've highlighted.  This idea was mentioned last summer in Dealbreaker. As explained in a Dealbook article: The settlement requires Google to pay the following amounts if, one year from the issuance of the Class C shares, the value diverges according to the following formula: If the C share price is equal to or more than 1 percent, but less than 2 percent, below the A share price, 20 percent of the difference; If the C share price is equal to or more than 2 percent, but less than 3 percent, below the A share price, 40 percent of the difference; If the C share price is equal to or more than 3 percent, but less than 4 percent, below the A share price, 60 percent of the difference; If the C share price is equal to or more than 4 percent, but less than 5 percent, below the A share price, 80 percent of the difference.\u201d If the C share price is equal to or more than 5 percent below the A share price, 100 percent of the difference, up to 5 percent. ... If the Class A shares trade around $450 (after the split/C issuance) and the C shares trade at a 4.5 percent discount during the year (or $429.75 per share), then investors expect a payment of: 80 percent times $450 times 4.5 percent = $16.20. The value of C shares would then be $445.95 ($429.75 plus $16.20). But if this is the new trading value during the year, that\u2019s only a discount of less than 1 percent to the A shares. So no payment would be made. But if no payment is made, we are back to the full discount and this continues ad infinitum. In other words, the value of a stock can be displayed as: {equity value} + {dividend value} + {voting value} + {settlement value} = {total share value} If we ignore dividend and voting values, and ignore premiums and discounts for risk and so forth, then the value of a share is basic equity value plus anticipated settlement payoff.  The Google Class C settlement is structured to reduce the payoff as the value converges.  And the practice of arbitrage guarantees (if you buy into at least semi-strong EMH) that the price of C shares will be shored up by arbitrageurs that want the payoff. The voting value of GOOGL is effectively zero, since the non-traded Class B shares control all company decisions.  So the value of the Class A GOOGL voting is virtually zero for the time being.  The only divergence between GOOGL and GOOG price is dividends (which I believe is supposed to be the same) and the settlement payoff.  Somebody who places zero value on the vote and who expects dividend difference to be zero should always prefer to buy GOOG to GOOGL until the price is equal, disregarding the settlement. So technically someone is better off owning GOOG, if dividends are the same and market prices are equal, just because the vote is worthless and the nonzero chance of a future settlement payoff is gravy. The arbitrage itself is present because a share that costs (as in the article) $429.75 is worth $445.95 if the settlement pays out at that rate.  The stable equilibrium is probably either just before or just after the threshold where the settlement pays off, depending on how reliably arbitrageurs can predict the movement of GOOG and GOOGL. If I can buy a given stock for X but know that it's worth X+1, then I'm willing to pay up to X+1.  In the google case, the GOOG stock is worth X+S, where S is an uncertain settlement payment that could be zero or could be substantial.  We have six tiers of S (counting zero payoff), so that the price is likely to follow a pattern from X to X+S5 to X-S5+S4 to X-S4+S3, and climbing the tier ladder until it lands in the frontier between X+S1 and X+S0.  Every time it jumps into X+S1, people should be willing to pay that new amount for GOOG, so the price moves out of payoff range and into X+S0, where people will only pay X. I'm actually simplifying here, since technically this is all based on future expectations.  So the actual price you'd pay is expressed thus: {resale value of GOOG before settlement payoff = X} + ( {expectation that settlement payoff will pay 100% of difference = S5} * {expected nominal difference between GOOG and GOOGL = D} ) + ({S4} * {80% D}) + ({S3} * {60% D}) + ({S2} * {40% D}) + ({S1} * {20% D}) + ({S0} * {0% D})  = {price willing to pay for Class C GOOG = P} Plus you'd technically have to present value the whole thing for the time horizon, since the payoff is in a year.  Note that I've shunted any voting/dividend analysis into X.  It's reasonable to thing that S5, S4, S3, and maybe S2 are nearly zero, given the open arbitrage opportunity.  And we know that S0 times 0% of D is zero.  So the real analysis, again ignoring PV, is thus: P = X + (S1*D) Which is a long way of saying: what are the odds that GOOG will happen to be worth no more than 99% of GOOGL on the payoff determination date?",
            "Too much fiddling with your portfolio if the difference is 3-4% or less (as it's become in recent months).  Hands off is the better advice.  As for buying shares, go for whichever is the cheapest (i.e. Goog rather than Googl) because the voting right with the latter is merely symbolic.  And who attends shareholders' meetings, for Pete's sake? On the other hand, if your holdings in the company are way up in the triple (maybe even quadruple) figures, then it might make sense to do the math and take the time to squeeze an extra percentage point or two out of your Googl purchases.  The idle rich occupying the exclusive club that includes only the top 1% of the population needs to have somethinng to do with its time.  Meanwhile, the rest of us are scrambling to make a living--leaving only enough time to visit our portfolios as often as Buffett advises (about twice a year)."

        "question": "Mutual fund value went down, shares went up, no action taken by me",
        "answer": "Based on the document you provided, the increase in shares and the decrease in the value of your mutual fund is likely related to the fund making distributions. Mutual funds distribute their earnings (such as dividends and capital gains) to shareholders, typically in December. If you have chosen to reinvest these distributions, which is often the default option, you would receive additional shares in the fund. However, the share price decreases by the amount of the per-share distribution. This means that after the distribution, you own more shares at a lower price per share, leaving the net value of your investment the same, excluding the normal market price fluctuations of the fund's holdings.\n\nHere is an example from your document explaining this concept:\n\nYou bought 56 shares at a price of $17.857 per share (net cost $1000). The fund distributed its earnings shortly thereafter, giving you 15.333 additional shares. The new share price became $14.11 as a result of the distribution. So, the total value of your investment is now $1012, but your total investment considering the distribution is $1216, meaning you have a notional loss on paper. Moreover, you owe income tax on the $216 dividend that you received, even though it was reinvested in additional shares .\n\nThis is why mutual fund companies typically recommend against making new investments in mutual funds towards the end of the year just before distributions are made since it can result in owning taxes on the distributions.\n\nPlease check your mutual fund statements or notifications for any notices about such distributions, as that would provide a more specific explanation of the changes in your mutual fund value and share count. If you need further assistance interpreting these notices or have additional questions, feel free to ask.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "You did something that you shouldn't have done; you bought a dividend.  Most mutual fund companies have educational materials on their sites that recommend against making new investments in mutual funds in the last two months of the year because most mutual funds distribute their earnings (dividends, capital gains etc) to their shareholders in December, and the share price of the funds goes down in the amount of the per share distribution. These distributions can be taken  in cash or can be re-invested in the fund; you most likely chose the latter  option (it is often the default choice if you ignored all this because you are a newbie). For those who choose to reinvest, the number of shares in the mutual fund increases, but since the price of the shares has decreased, the net amount remains the same. You own more shares at a lower price than the day before when the price was higher but the total value of your account is the same (ignoring normal market fluctuations in the price of the actual stocks held by the fund. Regardless of whether you take the distributions as cash or re-invest in the fund, that money is taxable income to you (unless the fund is owned inside a 401k or IRA or other tax-deferred investment program).  You bought 56 shares at a price of $17.857 per share (net cost $1000). The fund distributed its earnings shortly thereafter and gave you 71.333-56= 15.333 additional shares. The new share price is $14.11. So, the total value of your investment is $1012, but the amount that you have invested in the account is the original $1000 plus the amount of the distribution which is (roughly) $14.11 x 15.333 = $216.  Your total investment of $1216 is now worth $1012 only, and so you have actually lost money. Besides, you owe income tax on that $216 dividend that you received.  Do you see why the mutual fund companies recommend against making new investments late in the year?  If you had waited till after the mutual fund had made its distribution, you could have bought $1000/14.11 = 70.871 shares and wouldn't have owed tax on that distribution that you just bought by making the investment just before the distribution was made. See also my answer to this recent question about investing in mutual funds.",
            "It is very likely that the fund paid out a dividend in the form of reinvested shares.  This happens with many funds, especially as we come to the end of the year. Here's a simplified example of how it works.  Assume you invested $1000 and bought 100 units at $10/unit.  Ignoring the daily price fluctuations, if the fund paid out a 20% dividend, you would get $200 and the unit price would drop to $8/unit.  Assuming you chose to reinvest your dividends, you would automatically purchase another $200 worth of units at the new price (so 25 more units).  You would now have 125 units @ $8/unit = $1000 invested. In your example, notice that you now have more shares than you originally purchased, but that the price dropped significantly.  Your market value is above what you originally invested, so there was probably also a bit of a price increase for the day.  You should see the dividend transaction listed somewhere in your account. Just to confirm, I did a quick search on ICENX and found that they did indeed pay a dividend yesterday."

        "answer": "The cheapest ways to wire money from an Australian bank account to a person in England, while you are in Laos, can vary depending on the amount you are transferring and how quickly you need the funds to arrive. Here are a couple of options from the document provided:\n\n1. **PayPal**: This is a convenient option if both you and the recipient have PayPal accounts. Transferring money through PayPal can be quick, and recipients can move the funds to their bank account, although PayPal does charge a fee for currency conversion and transfer services .\n\n2. **Currency Fair**: This is a service that facilitates international money transfers and can be set up via the internet. The process involves opening an account with Currency Fair, transferring AUD to an Australian bank account they provide, then exchanging and transferring the money to the recipient. Currency Fair generally offers more competitive rates than PayPal, and you have the option to potentially get better rates if you're not in a rush by using their exchange by marketplace functionality .\n\n3. **OFX**: OFX functions by making local transfers on both ends of the transaction, speeding up the process compared to normal international bank transfers. They also claim to offer lower exchange rates and fees. However, it's worth noting that setting up the account might take some time, as they need to contact you by phone, which could be an issue if you are in a hurry .\n\n4. **Bank Account Transfer (IBAN/SWIFT)**: You could utilize international bank transfers using IBAN and SWIFT codes. These transfers take between 1 and 10 days, and there are usually costs involved except for transfers within the EU. However, this might not be the cheapest option as banks often have higher fees and less favorable exchange rates .\n\n5. **International Money Transfer Services**: If the amounts are larger, it might be worth considering other services such as Interactive Brokers or OANDA for better exchange rates. For amounts under $10,000, services like CurrencyFair and XE Trade could be more cost-effective, with the latter also offering EFT transfers to save on wire fees .\n\nTo find the best option, you should consider the size of the transfer, the fees involved, the exchange rate offered, and how quickly you need the funds to be available. Always compare the total cost of the transaction, including fees and exchange rate margins, before deciding. Remember that some services may not operate in all regions, so availability in Laos should also be checked.",

It is by far the easiest way. If you are uncomfortable using paypal, the other option would be through your own bank account, where you would transfer using IBAN/SWIFT. The SWIFT bank account is usually the IBAN code plus a branch code. Often it is difficult to find the branch code, in that case you can use the IBAN+XXX. In the latter things might be delayed, but I actually haven't noticed the delay yet, since international transfer always seem to take between 1 and 10 days.

        "question": "How does Vanguard determine the optimal asset allocation for their Target Retirement Funds?",
        "answer": "Vanguard determines the optimal asset allocation for their Target Retirement Funds using a strategic approach based on financial simulations and capital markets modeling. The process involves evaluating different risk-reward scenarios and the implications of various glide paths and Target Date Fund (TDF) approaches. Two central principles guide this process:\n\n1. An expectation of an equity risk premium based on historical records, where stock market investors have been rewarded with a substantial premium over bond returns, which have lagged equity returns by about 5-6 percentage points annually. This return differential is significant over longer time periods, so retirement savers investing only in \"safe\" assets would need to increase their savings rates to compensate for the lower expected returns.\n\n2. Younger investors have a better ability to withstand risk since an individual's total net worth consists of both financial holdings and future earnings, termed \"human capital.\" A larger commitment to stocks in a younger person's portfolio may be appropriate to balance and diversify the risk exposure to work-related earnings.\n\nTo implement these principles into actual TDF asset allocations, Vanguard runs various financial simulations using the Vanguard Capital Markets Model, exploring different glide paths and TDF approaches and their potential market implications.\n\nThe specific details regarding how Vanguard chooses the exact levels of stocks or bonds in the Target Retirement Funds are not fully explained in the provided document, but the process involves thorough analysis of theoretical and simulation-based frameworks to identify appropriate glide paths that align with long-term retirement objectives .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Googling vanguard target asset allocation led me to this page on the Bogleheads wiki which has detailed breakdowns of the Target Retirement funds; that page in turn has a link to this Vanguard PDF which goes into a good level of detail on the construction of these funds' portfolios. I excerpt: (To the question of why so much weight in equities:) In our view, two important considerations justify an expectation of an   equity risk premium. The first is the historical record: In the past,   and in many countries, stock market investors have been rewarded with   such a premium.  ... Historically, bond returns have lagged equity returns by about 5\u20136   percentage points, annualized\u2014amounting to an enormous return   differential in most circumstances over longer time periods.   Consequently, retirement savers investing only in \u201csafe\u201d assets must   dramatically increase their savings rates to compensate for the lower   expected returns those investments offer. ... The second strategic principle underlying our glidepath   construction\u2014that younger investors are better able to withstand   risk\u2014recognizes that an individual\u2019s total net worth consists of both   their current financial holdings and their future work earnings. For   younger individuals, the majority of their ultimate retirement wealth   is in the form of what they will earn in the future, or their \u201chuman   capital.\u201d Therefore, a large commitment to stocks in a younger   person\u2019s portfolio may be appropriate to balance and diversify risk   exposure to work-related earnings (To the question of how the exact allocations were decided:) As part of the process of evaluating and identifying an appropriate   glide path given this theoretical framework, we ran various   financial simulations using the Vanguard Capital Markets Model. We   examined different risk-reward scenarios and the potential   implications of different glide paths and TDF approaches. The PDF is highly readable, I would say, and includes references to quant articles, for those that like that sort of thing.",
            "While the Vanguard paper is good, it doesn't do a very good job of explaining precisely why each level of stocks or bonds was optimal. If you'd like to read a transparent and quantitative explanation of when and why a a glide path is optimal, I'd suggest the following paper:  https://www.betterment.com/resources/how-we-construct-portfolio-allocation-advice/ (Full disclosure - I'm the author).  The answer is that the optimal risk level for any given holding period depends upon a combination of:  Using these two factors, you construct a risk-averse decision model which chooses the risk level with the best expected average outcome, where it looks only at the median and lower percentile outcomes. This produces an average which is specifically robust to downside risk. The result will look something like this:   The exact results will depend on the expected risk and return of the portfolio, and the degree of risk aversion specified.  The result is specifically valid for the case where you liquidate all of the portfolio at a specific point in time. For retirement, the glide path needs to be extended to take into account the fact that the portfolio will be liquidated gradually over time, and dynamically take into account the longevity risk of the individual.  I can't say precisely why Vanguard's path is how it is."

        "question": "If I have a lot of debt and the housing market is rising, should I rent and slowly pay off my debt or buy and roll the debt into a mortgage?",
        "answer": "Deciding whether to rent and pay off debt slowly or to buy a home and consolidate debt into a mortgage involves several financial and personal factors. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Debt Interest Rates vs. Mortgage Rates**: If the interest rates on your existing debt are significantly higher than current mortgage rates, it could make financial sense to roll your high-interest debt into a lower-interest mortgage. However, this also means that you're securing your previously unsecured debt against your home, which could be riskier.\n\n2. **Housing Market Conditions**: If the housing market is rising, buying a property could be a good investment as your home may appreciate in value. However, this should not be the sole reason to purchase a property, especially if your financial situation is not stable due to high debt levels.\n\n3. **Affordability**: Ensure that you can afford the mortgage payments, perhaps even in a climate of rising interest rates. Don't forget to include property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other homeownership costs in your calculations.\n\n4. **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: When applying for a mortgage, lenders will look at your debt-to-income ratio. If it's too high due to existing debt, you may not qualify for a mortgage, or you might not get the most favorable terms.\n\n5. **Credit Score**: Your credit score will influence both your ability to get a mortgage and the rates you'll be offered. If high debt has negatively affected your credit score, it might be better to improve it before applying for a mortgage.\n\n6. **Emergency Savings**: Before deciding to buy a home, you should ideally have emergency savings in place, as unexpected home repairs can be costly.\n\n7. **Short vs. Long-Term View**: Renting can offer more flexibility if you aren't sure where you want to live long-term. Buying usually makes more sense as a long-term investment due to the costs of buying and selling property.\n\n8. **Equity Building**: Owning a home can allow you to build equity as the value of your home appreciates and as you pay down the mortgage.\n\n9. **Rent vs. Own Lifestyle**: Consider lifestyle preferences, such as the desire for stability and the ability to customize your living space versus the flexibility and reduced responsibilities that come with renting.\n\n10. **Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial situation and future goals.\n\nIt's important to do thorough financial planning and perhaps seek professional advice tailored to your unique circumstances. If you have a document that outlines your financial situation or further details that you'd want to discuss, I can also help to review and provide more specific guidance.",

            "\"The only way to \"\"roll\"\" debt into a home purchase is to have sufficient down payment.  Under the \"\"new\"\" lending rules that took effect in Canada earlier this year, you must have at least 5% of the purchase price as a down payment.  If you have $60,000 in additional debt, the total amount of mortgage still cannot be greater than 95% of the purchase price.  Below is an example. Purchase price of home $200,000. Maximum mortgage $190,000 (95% of purchase price) Total outside debt $60,000 That means the mortgage (other than the current debt of $60k) can only be $130,000 This means you would need a down payment of $70,000. Also keep in mind that I have not included any other legal fees, real estate commissions, etc in this example. Since it is safe to assume that you do not have $70k available for a down payment, renting and paying down the debt is likely the better route.  Pay off the credit card(s) first as they have the higher interest amount. Best of luck!\"",
            "What you propose is to convert unsecured debt into secured debt. Conversion of unsecured debt into secured debt is not generally a good idea (several reasons).  The debt you currently owe does not have assets securing the debt, so the creditor knows they are exposed to risk, and may be more willing to negotiate or relax terms on the debt, should you encounter problems.  When you provide an asset to secure debt, you lose freedom to sell that asset.  When you incur debt their is usually a spending problem that needs to be corrected, which is typically not fixed when a refinance solution is used.  You do not mention interest rate, which would be one benefit to conversion of unsecured to secured debt, so you probably are not gaining adequate benefit from the conversion strategy. This strategy is often contemplated using 'cash-out' refinancing to borrow against a home you already own, and the (claimed) benefit is often to lower the interest rate on the debt.  Your scenario is more complicated in that you have not purchased the home (yet).  Though it may be a good idea to purchase a home, that choice depends on a different set of considerations (children, job stability, rental vs. buy costs, lifestyle, expected appreciation, etc) from how to best handle a large debt (income vs. expenses, how to increase income or reduce expenses, lifestyle, priorities, etc). Another consideration is that you already have a problem with the large debt owed to one (set of) creditor(s), and you have a plan which would shift the risk/exposure to another (set of) creditor(s) who may have been less complicit in accruing the original debt.  Was the debt incurred jointly during the marriage, and something you accepted responsibility to repay? You mention that you make great income, and you specify one expense (rent), but you neither provided the amount of income, total of all your expenses, nor your free cash flow amount, nor any indication of percentages spent on rent, essential expenses, lifestyle, nor amount available to retire debt.  Since you did not provide specifics, we can take a look at three scenarios, scenario #1, $4000/month income scenario #1, $6000/month income scenario #1, $8000/month income Depending upon your income and choices, you might have < $500/month to pay towards debt, or as much as $3000/month to pay towards debt, and depending upon interest rate (which OP did not provide), this debt could take < 2 years to pay or > 5 years to pay. Have you accepted the responsibility for the debt?  It will be a tough task to repay the debt.  And you will learn that debt comes with a cost as you repay it.  One problem people often encounter when they refinance debt is they have not changed the habits which produced the debt.  So they often continue their spending habits and incur new unsecured debt, landing them back in the same problem position, but with the increased secured debt combined with additional new unsecured debt.  Challenge yourself to repay a specific portion of the debt in a specific time, and consider ways to reduce your expenses (and/or increase your income) to provide more money to repay the debt quicker. As you also did not disclose your assets, it is hard to know whether you could repay a portion of the debt from assets you already own.  It makes sense to sell assets that have a low (or zero) return to repay debt that has a high interest rate.  Perhaps you have substantial assets that you are reluctant to sell, but that you could sell to repay a large part of the debt?",
            "\"Buy and Hope is a common investment strategy. It's also one that will keep you poor. Instead of thinking about saving money to put against a credit card or line of credit using your own job and hard-earned dollars, why not use someone else's money? If you have enough of a down payment for a property of your own, consider a duplex, triplex, or 4-plex where you live in one of the units. Since you will be living there you only need 5% down as opposed to 20% down if you do not live there. This arrangement gives you a place to live while you have other people paying your mortgage and other debts. If done properly, you can find a place that is cash-flow positive so you basically live rent-free.  This all assumes you have a down payment and a bank that will work with you. Your best bet is to discuss your situation with a mortgage broker. They know all the rules, and which banks have the best deal for you. A mortgage broker works on your behalf and is paid by the lending institution, not you. There are various caveats with this strategy, and they all revolve around knowing what to do and how to execute the plan. I suggest Googling Robert Kiyosaki and reading \"\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\"\" before taking this journey. He offers a number of free and paid seminars that teach people how to purchase real estate and make it pay. I have taken the free evening seminar and the $500 weekend seminar on how to purchase properties and make money with them. Note that I have no affiliation with Kiyosaki, and I do find his methods to work.\""

        "question": "What does a high theta mean for an option position?",
        "answer": "A high theta value for an option position indicates that the option is losing value as time passes, especially as it gets closer to expiration. Theta is a measure of an option's time decay and represents the change in the option's price for a one-day reduction in the time to expiration. If you have a position with a high theta value, it means that the time decay is working in your favor if you are the seller of the option, as the value of the option you sold is decreasing each day the market moves closer to the options\u2019 expiration date.\n\nIn the context of a short spread position, for example, if the options involved are deep out of the money, it's very likely that they'll expire worthless, and the position will benefit from the decay of the time premium as time progresses. Therefore, the position will gain value each day (assuming no change in stock price or volatility), as it's the time premium that is primarily influencing the option's value at that point .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Option prices consist of two parts: the intrinsic value (the difference between the strike and the current price of the stock) and a time premium, representing the probability that the stock will end up above the strike for a call (or below for a put).   All else being equal, options decline in value as time passes, since there is less uncertainty about the expected value of the stock at expiration and thus the time premium is smaller.  Theta is the measure of the change in value in one day.  So for every day that passes, the calls you sold are going down by $64.71 (which is positive to you since you sold them at a higher value) and the calls you sold are going down by $49.04. So your position (a short spread) is gaining $15.67 each day (assuming no change in stock price or volatility). In reality, the stock price and volatility also change every day, and those are much stronger drivers of the value of your options.  In your case, however, the options are deep out of the money, meaning it's very likely that they'll expire worthless, so all you have left is time premium, which is decaying as time goes on."

Generally, a boxed trade in terms of taxation could refer to a situation where a trader holds both long and short positions in the same security, potentially aiming to defer taxes on capital gains. However, this is not explicitly covered in the files obtained from the search results.\n\nIn the context of tax laws, investors may have capital gain or loss treatments depending on their status and the holding period of their assets, as well as different rules for dividends and stock redemptions. For example, capital gains from assets held for more than a year can benefit from lower tax rates, while short-term gains are often taxed at higher rates as ordinary income. There are also specific treatments for dividends and stock redemptions; however, these topics do not directly address the tax implications of a boxed trade .\n\nFor accurate advice on the tax treatment of a boxed trade, you may want to consult a tax professional who can provide guidance based on the current tax laws and your specific circumstances.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Here's how capital gains are totaled: Long and Short Term. Capital gains and losses are either long-term or   short-term. It depends on how long the taxpayer holds the property. If   the taxpayer holds it for one year or less, the gain or loss is   short-term. Net Capital Gain.  If a taxpayer\u2019s long-term gains are more than their   long-term losses, the difference between the two is a net long-term   capital gain. If the net long-term capital gain is more than the net   short-term capital loss, the taxpayer has a net capital gain. So your net long-term gains (from all investments, through all brokers) are offset by any net short-term loss.  Short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate. I'm trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain, but at the same time trade the stock. If you close in the next year, one of two things will happen - either the stock will go down, and you'll have short-term gains on the short, or the stock will go up, and you'll have short-term losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock.  So I don;t see how it reduces your tax liability.  At best it defers it."

Instead, companies will internally hold shares that they intend to offer employees as additional compensation. There are no open market transactions associated with this practice, so the market price of the stock does not change due to buying pressure from the company purchasing shares for employees.\n\nWhen companies issue new shares, they often keep some internally precisely for situations where they want to provide shares to employees. This avoids the need to purchase shares in the market and has no immediate impact on the market price. If companies were to issue new shares every pay period specifically for employee compensation, it would dilute the existing shares multiple times a quarter, which would be complex to account for and could potentially have a negative impact on the share price due to the dilution of value.",

There are no open market transactions, so the market price of the stock does not change (at least not due to buying pressure).  The only net effect is an equivalent expense for the compensation, but that should already be accounted for in the share price as normal operating expenses.

I know the ESOP and 401K aren't the same, but in my company every year the number of participants in the company stock purchase program decreases. The small number of participants and the small portion of their new retirement funds being in company shares would mean this spike in volume would be very small.  The ESOP plan for my employer takes money each paycheck, then purchases the shares once a quarter. This delay would allow them to manage the purchases better.

        "answer": "To know precisely when a SWIFT is issued by a bank, you usually won't find an exact timestamp in your account statements or online banking portal because the SWIFT network doesn't provide the end customer with a detailed timestamp of when the transaction was initiated. Instead, the best way to confirm the actual time a SWIFT transfer was issued is to directly contact your bank. They can provide you with transaction-specific details, including the date and time when the SWIFT transfer was instructed.\n\nIn general, when you request a SWIFT transfer, your bank will give you an estimated time frame for the transfer to be processed and completed. This is often within 1 to 5 business days, depending on the currency, destination, and the banks involved in the transfer chain. However, the exact moment when the SWIFT transaction is initiated might vary depending on the bank's processing schedules and cut-off times for international transfers.\n\nFor example, in the uploaded document, it mentions that to transfer money from the USA to Europe, a person should ask their European banker for the SWIFT transfer instructions and that typically, the sending bank in the USA will need a SWIFT code, an account number, the name and address of the recipient, and the amount to transfer. The typical time for such a transfer is under 2 days, but the document advises to inquire with the sending bank about any fees and exact processing times .\n\nTo get the precise moment a SWIFT has been issued, you should request a confirmation from the sending bank. This can often be in the form of a SWIFT message copy, which contains a timestamp showing when the SWIFT instruction was sent out by the bank.

        "answer": "The term \"priced in\" refers to the idea that a current price of a security, like a stock, already reflects all known information about that security and its potential impacts. This includes public news or events that might affect the valuation of the asset. If the market is aware of a certain event or piece of information, it is believed that this has been factored into the price already, thus not providing a new opportunity for investors to exploit based on that known information.\n\nFor instance, if a company is expected to release a new and innovative product, this expectation might be priced into the stock even before the actual release, so the price would not necessarily jump further once the product is announced, because the market anticipated this and it was already reflected in the price. When something is \"priced in,\" it suggests that there is a consensus in the market about the value of the future events or information with regard to the price of a security.\n\nThis concept is tied to market efficiency, which suggests that the market reflects all available information in the price of securities. The only way to achieve a significant gain, under the assumption of perfect market efficiency, would be to trade on information that is not yet available to the public (i.e., secret or insider information).\n\nSo when you hear someone say that something is \u2018priced in\u2019, they are indicating that they believe the current price has already accounted for the particular factor they are discussing, be it an event, a future earning expectation, or other influential factors .",

If you think the priced in numbers are too low, buy the stock as that would mean that its price will go up as the future earnings materialize. If you think it's too high, short the stock, as its price will go down as future earnings fail to materialize. The current price represents the price at which just as much pressure pushes the price up as down. That means people agree it's reasonably approximating the expected future value. Imagine if I needed money now and sold at auction whatever salary I make in 2019. How much will I make in 2019? I might be disabled. I might be a high earner. Who knows? But if I auction off those earnings, whatever price it sells for represents everyone's best estimate of that value. But each participant in the auction can estimate that value however they want. If you want to know what something is worth, you see what you can sell it for.",
            "\"I think the first misconception to clear up is that you are implying the price of a stock is set by a specific person. It is not. The price of a stock is equal to the value that someone most recently traded at. If Apple last traded at $100/share, then Apple shares are worth $100. If good news about Apple hits the market and people holding the shares ask for more money, and the most recent trade becomes $105, then that is now what Apple shares are worth. Remember that generally speaking, the company itself does not sell you its shares - instead, some other investor sells you shares they already own. When a company sells you shares, it is called a 'public offering'. To get to your actual question, saying something is 'priced in' implies that the 'market' (that is, investors who are buying and selling shares in the company) has already considered the impacts of that something. For example, if you open up your newspaper and read an article about IBM inventing a new type of computer chip, you might want to invest in IBM. But, the rest of the market has also heard the news. So everyone else has already traded IBM assuming that this new chip would be made. That means when you buy, even if sales later go up because of the new chip, those sales were already considered by the person who chose the price to sell you the shares at. One principle of the stock market (not agreed to by all) is called market efficiency. Generally, if there were perfect market efficiency, then every piece of public information about a company would be perfectly integrated into its stock price. In such a scenario, the only way to get real value when buying a company would be to have secret information of some sort. It would mean that everyone's collective best-guess about what will happen to the company has been \"\"priced-in\"\" to the most recent share trade.\"",

For example, the difference in price right before and right after a dividend is released often differ exactly by that dividend -- the fact that the dividend would function as a \"\"relate\"\" on the purchase price was priced into the earlier quote, and its absence for another year was priced into the later quote. The ten can be applied to any expected or likely event, if you really think the price reflects that opportunity of risk. It just means that this factor, in the speaker's opinion, doesn't create an opportunity one can take advantage of.\""

        "question": "Approximate IT company valuation (to proximate stock options value)",
        "answer": "From the content of the document provided, there is a discussion regarding the valuation of a company, which is often a subjective measure based on perceived value. It notes that a company can have a valuation of $400k, but this isn't necessarily tied to an objective measure or a piece of paper; rather, it is about what an investor is willing to pay based on their perception and the knowledge they may have, which may even include sentimental value. In the context given, this valuation comes into play during a transaction where an investor receives a percentage of ownership in return for their investment, suggesting that the worth of the company may indeed be as much as someone is willing to pay for it at the time of the transaction. It emphasizes that valuation is primarily about perception and not necessarily listed as an asset on a balance sheet, except for the actual cash invested, which can be used for various purposes like funding inventory .\n\nIn terms of stock options valuation, it could be inferred that one must consider not only the current valuation of the company but also the perception of its future success, which can affect the value of the stock options. However, the document does not explicitly provide a method for calculating the value of stock options based on the valuation of the IT company. For a more precise calculation, it would typically involve understanding the company's financials, the volatility of its stock, and the specifics of the stock options granted, such as the strike price and the expiration date. This might require further tools and methods such as the Black-Scholes model or other financial models to approximate the value of stock options more accurately.",

            "This situation sounds better than most, the company it seems likely to be profitable in the future.  As such it is a good candidate to have a successful IPO.   With that your stock options are likely to be worth something.  How much of that is your share is likely to be very small.  The workers that have been their since the beginning, the venture capitalist, and the founders will make the majority of profits from an IPO or sale.  Since you and others hired at a similar time as you are assuming almost no risk it is fair that your share of the take is small.   Despite being 1/130 employees expect your share of the profits to be much smaller than .77%.  How about we go with .01%?   Lets also assume that they go public in 2.5 years and that revenues during that time continue to increase by about 25M/year.  Profit margins remains the same.  So revenues to 112M, profits to 22.5M. Typically the goal for business is to pay no more than 5 times profits, that could be supplanted by other factors, but let's assume that figure.  So about 112M from the IPO.  So .01% of that is about 11K.  That feels about right. Keep in mind there would be underwriting fees, and also I would discount that figure for things that could go wrong.  I'd be at about 5K. That would be my expected value figure, 5K.  I'd also understand that there is a very small likelihood that I receive that amount.  The value received is more likely to be zero, or enough to buy a Ferarri. There might also be some value in getting to know these people.  If this fails will their next venture be a success. In my own life, I went to work for a company that looked great on paper that just turned out to be a bust.  Great concept, horrible management, and within a couple of years of being hired, the company went bust.  I worked like a dog for nothing.",
            "You also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company.  So if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an IPO, the effective value of the stock options is zero.  That is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options.   With a Google or Facebook, stock options can be exercised and immediately sold, as they are publicly traded.  In fact, they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding.  You can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time, even after you leave the company.  You only need the option/grant to vest to take advantage of it.  Valuing these at face value (current stock price) makes sense.  That's at least a reasonable guess of future value.   If you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the IPO, then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense.  A ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar IPO market capitalization easily.  Divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get.  If anything, that gives you a conservative estimate.   I would still favor the big company offers though.  As I said, they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the IPO.  If you leave before then, you get nothing.  If they delay the IPO, you're stuck.  You can't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation.  That seems a big commitment to make."

        "answer": "Based on the information provided, it appears that claiming your father as your dependent shouldn't, in itself, cause him to be ineligible for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). The document states that the main criteria for SNAP eligibility include limits on the household's \"countable resources,\" such as a bank account and income. It is also noted that for SNAP purposes, a household is defined as everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals together. If you are providing your father with financial support but he lives and eats separately, he is likely not considered part of your household for SNAP purposes.\n\nAdditionally, for IRS purposes, your father does not need to be part of your household to be considered your dependent. As long as you pay more than half of his support and more than half the cost of keeping up a home that is his main home for the entire year, you may claim him as a dependent and possibly file as \"head of household.\" Though the IRS and FNS (the agency that administers SNAP) are separate entities with different definitions, it is conceivable that your father could still be eligible for SNAP even if you claim him as a dependent for tax purposes .\n\nHowever, since the IRS and FNS have different rules and definitions, the ultimate determination of eligibility may vary, and it may be prudent to seek expert advice to understand how these definitions may affect your specific situation. It's recommended to consult with a professional who specializes in such matters to make sure you are maximizing support for your father without negatively impacting his overall level of assistance .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"It seems that counting your father as your dependent shouldn't, in itself, cause him to be ineligible for SNAP. Eligibility requirements for SNAP can be found on this FNS page. There are upper limits on the \"\"countable resources, such as a bank account\"\" that the beneficiary's household may have, and on that household's income. (There are some other requirements, too.) From what I can tell from your question, your father shouldn't be part of your household for SNAP purposes, because: Everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals together is grouped together as one household. If you're transferring him money, I assume he's living and eating somewhere else, so it seems you are not part of his household. According to the IRS's Publication 501, your father is not required to be part of your household for IRS purposes to be your dependent. The test to qualify is that a non-child dependent must either: Live with you all year as a member of your household, or Be related to you in one of the ways listed under Relatives who do not have to live with you. However, by the \"\"Special rule for parent\"\", you may be able to use your father as your qualifying person (dependent) to be able to file as \"\"head of household\"\", so long as you pay more than half their support, and \"\"more than half the cost of keeping up a home that was the main home for the entire year for your father\"\". I don't know if in this case the IRS would consider your father \"\"part of your household\"\" or not. Even if the IRS considered your father part of your household based on the way you filed your taxes, I think it's possible, as the IRS and FNS are two different entities, that the definition of your father's household for SNAP purposes could be different from the IRS's.\"",

        "question": "What does it mean if \u201cIPOs - normally are sold with an `underwriting discount` (a built in commission)\u201d",
        "answer": "When IPOs are sold with an \"underwriting discount,\" it means that the shares are offered by the underwriters to the public at a price that is lower than the price the underwriters pay to the issuer. This difference or discount is essentially a built-in commission for the underwriters to compensate them for the risk and the work involved in selling the shares as part of the IPO process. It's like a fee the issuing company pays to the underwriters for their services in helping to bring the company public.\n\nBased on the context found in the provided document, underwriting fees are mentioned as part of the expenses that would be deducted from the proceeds of an IPO, which would affect the overall profit share for individuals involved, as these are typically costs borne by the issuer.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"When an IPO happens, the buyers pay some price (let's say $20 per share) and the seller (the company) receives a different price ($18.60).  Who paid the commission? Well, the commission caused a spread between buyer and seller.  It doesn't matter who technically pays the commission because it costs both parties.  In an IPO, the company technically pays the commission, but they use buyers' money to do it and the buyer must pay more than he/she would if there was no commission. The same thing happens when you buy a home.  Technically the seller pays both realtors' commissions but it came from money the buyer gave the seller and the commissions pushed up the price, so didn't the buyer pay the commission?  They both did. The second paragraph suggests that if the investment bankers act as a simple broker, buying public securities instead of newly issued shares for their clients, then the commissions will be much lower.  Obviously.  I wonder if this is really the right interpretation, though, as no broker charges 4% to a large client for this service.  I would need more context to be sure that's what's meant. The gyst is that IPOs generate a lot of money for the investment bankers who act as intermediaries.  If you are participating in the transaction, that money is in some way coming out of your pocket, even if it doesn't show up as a \"\"brokerage fee\"\" on your statement.\"",
            "\"Also, in the next sentence, what is buyers commission? Is it referring to the share holder? Or potential share holder? And why does the buyer get commission?  The buyer doesn't get a commission.  The buyer pays a commission.  So normally a buyer would say, \"\"I want to buy a hundred shares at $20.\"\"  The broker would then charge the buyer a commission.  Assuming 4%, the commission would be  So the total cost to the buyer is $2080 and the seller receives $2000.  The buyer paid a commission of $80 as the buyer's commission.   In the case of an IPO, the seller often pays the commission.  So the buyer might pay $2000 for a hundred shares which have a 7% commission.  The brokering agent (or agents may share) pockets a commission of $140.  Total paid to the seller is $1860.   Some might argue that the buyer pays either way, as the seller receives money in the transaction.  That's a reasonable outlook.  A better way to say this might be that typical trades bill the buyer directly for commission while IPO purchases bill the seller.  In the typical trade, the buyer negotiates the commission with the broker.  In an IPO, the seller does (with the underwriter).   Another issue with an IPO is that there are more parties getting commission than just one.  As a general rule, you still call your broker to purchase the stock.  The broker still expects a commission.  But the IPO underwriter also expects a commission.  So the 7% commission might be split between the IPO underwriter (works for the selling company) and the broker (works for the buyer).   The broker has more work to do than normal.  They have to put in the buyer's purchase request and manage the price negotiation.  In most purchases, you just say something like \"\"I want to offer $20 a share\"\" or \"\"I want to purchase at the market price.\"\"  In an IPO, they may increase the price, asking for $25 a share.  And they may do that multiple times.  Your broker has to come back to you each time and get a new authorization at the higher price.  And you still might not get the number of shares that you requested.   Beyond all this, you may still be better off buying an IPO than waiting until the next day.  Sure, you pay more commission, but you also may be buying at a lower price.  If the IPO price is $20 but the price climbs to $30, you would have been better off paying the IPO price even with the higher commission.  However, if the IPO price is $20 and the price falls to $19.20, you'd be better off buying at $19.20 after the IPO.  Even though in that case, you'd pay the 4% commission on top of the $19.20, so about $19.97.   I think that the overall point of the passage is that the IPO underwriter makes the most money by convincing you to pay as high an IPO price as possible.  And once they do that, they're out of the picture.  Your broker will still be your broker later.  So the IPO underwriter has a lot of incentive to encourage you to participate in the IPO instead of waiting until the next day.  The broker doesn't care much either way.  They want you to buy and sell something.  The IPO or something else.  They don't care much as to what.   The underwriter may overprice the stock, as that maximizes their return.  If they can convince enough people to overpay, they don't care that the stock falls the day after that.  All their marketing effort is to try to achieve that result.  They want you to believe that your $20 purchase will go up to $30 the next day.  But it might not.   These numbers may not be accurate.  Obviously the $20 stock price is made up.  But the 4% and 7% numbers may also be inaccurate.  Modern online brokers are very competitive and may charge a flat fee rather than a percentage.  The book may be giving you older numbers that were correct in 1983 (or whatever year).  The buyer's commission could also be lower than 4%, as the seller also may be charged a commission.  If each pays 2%, that's about 4% total but split between a buyer's commission and a seller's commission.\""

Firstly, if you have a loss on the stock and you repurchase it within 30 days, you are not allowed to recognize the loss for tax purposes, and instead, you have to add the loss to your basis in the newly purchased stock\u2014this is known as the Wash Sale Rule .\n\nMoreover, when you sell a stock, you trigger a taxable event and therefore have to pay capital gains tax on any gains.

Additionally, you should consider the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) if your modified adjusted gross income is above the threshold .\n\nConsidering the tax implications and rules like the wash sale, it's often not advisable to sell and immediately repurchase the same stock for the purpose of tax benefits.

This particular system isn't very powerful because of its poor use of simple moving averages. A simple moving average is intended to smooth out data, but smoothing comes at the cost of lagging from the present.

If a significant portion of your net worth is tied up in your company, diversifying by exercising and selling some of your options might be recommended .\n\n4. **Investment Strategy**: Selling and immediately repurchasing the same stock doesn't generally make sense due to tax implications such as capital gains taxes and the wash sale rule. However, dollar-cost averaging and methodical selling of some shares over time can be effective strategies .\n\n5. **Holding Period**: If you've held stocks for close to a year, it might be beneficial to continue holding until you reach the one-year mark to qualify for long-term capital gains tax rates rather than short-term rates .\n\n6. **Risk Management**: Using strategies like trailing stop losses, which automate the sale of stock once it falls a certain percentage from its highest price, is one way to protect gains without selling all shares at once .\n\nIn summary, whether to sell all or just a portion of your stock is a decision that should be tailored to your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. It may often be more advantageous to consider a staggered approach rather than an 'all or nothing' method. As always, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is recommended.",

        "answer": "If you have found incorrect printed information on your check stock, it is not recommended to alter the printed checks yourself. Printed numbers on checks are usually machine-readable and correcting a check would render it unreadable by the machines that process these checks. As such, any obvious amendment to a check's details is likely to raise suspicion and may result in the check being refused. The best course of action is to contact the printing house that made the error or your bank if they printed them and request them to reprint the batch. You should inquire with your bank about what to do with the incorrect checks; they may ask you to return them to the bank, or they may allow you to keep them. If allowed to keep them, it's generally suggested that you should destroy them to avoid any confusion or misuse .\n\nFurthermore, be aware that the check number is printed in two places on the front of each check: in the upper right corner and along the bottom edge. The bank scans the check number from the bottom edge of the check, so modifying or covering the numbers at the upper corner will not affect processing, but you cannot modify the numbers along the bottom without interfering with the check processing. Instead of modifying check numbers, you'll need to resolve the issue through the printing house or bank that provided the checks .",

            "Even where national law might allow such a practice, the law in an individual province or state (either for issuing or receiving bank) might not; or if that does then the receiving bank may have its own regulations or compliance practice which may not permit them to accept an altered cheque.  In any case, printed numbers are usually machine-readable, and a corrected cheque would not be.  The question needs a specific answer which addresses the specific circumstances involved (which are not stated, at the time of writing this), but for the general question \u201cShould I alter a printed cheque?\u201d the answer must be no. Cheque numbers are used for identification of the cheque. In many cases, there is no verification of uniqueness and it would be perfectly acceptable simply to use cheques with duplicate numbers: a cheque is merely an order to the bank to make a payment. But you would not be able to identify a particular payment on your statement, and neither would the issuing bank if you wanted one stopped. Where the number is verified as unique, then clearing the payment may be refused or at best delayed in order to be queried. Making an obvious amendment to a cheque\u2019s details is likely to raise a red flag. The receiving bank would not be able to tell if you did it, or the payee; they would not know why. They may suspect that it was done in order to render the cheque unidentifiable [even though the opposite is in fact the case] and refuse to accept it. They may refuse to accept it because it could not be read automatically. Any refusal would sour your relationship with your payees. Presumably your printing house (or your bank, if they printed them) has made the error: raise it with them and have them reprint the batch. Ask your bank what to do with the incorrect cheques: they may want them returned to the bank, or they may be happy for you to keep (and even use) them. If the latter, I suggest you shred them.",

Since the check number is scanned by the bank from the bottom edge of the check, covering or otherwise modifying the check number on the upper left corner will have no effect on the check number that is recorded when the check is processed. And, you can't modify or cover the numbers or place any marks in the area of the numbers along the bottom of the check as this will likely interfere with processing of checks. So, modifying the check numbers will not work. Your choices are basically to:   The check numbers are not used in any way in clearing the check, the numbers are only for your convenience, so processing checks with duplicate numbers won't matter.  The check numbers are recorded when processed at your bank so they can be shown on your printed and online statements. The only time the check number might be important is if you had to \"\"stop payment\"\" on a particular check, or otherwise inquire about a particular check. But this should not really be an issue because by the time you have used up the first batch of checks, and start using the checks with duplicate numbers, the first use of the early duplicate numbered checks will be sufficiently long ago that there should not be any chance of processing checks with duplicate numbers at the same time. You didn't mention how many checks you have with duplicate numbers, or how frequently you actually write checks so that may play a part in your decision. In my case, 100 checks will last me literally years, so it wouldn't be a problem for me.\""

The stock is usually considered a capital asset for investors, and if you held the stock for more than a year, capital gains are typically taxed at a reduced rate (for example, 20% instead of 39.6%). However, if the asset was held for less than a year, the gains would generally be taxed at the higher ordinary income rates.\n\nThis treatment is similar for both individual stocks and stock funds, meaning that the favorable long-term capital gains tax rates apply to gains on assets held for more than a year, regardless of whether these assets are individual stocks or stock ETFs, including bond ETFs.

Each index has its own methodology for calculating the value of the index points, and this can vary depending on the type of weighting used. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price-weighted index, meaning that stocks with higher prices are given more significance than those with lower prices, regardless of the overall size of the company. Therefore, the DJIA's points reflect the aggregate of the prices of its component stocks, adjusted by factors such as stock splits or changes in the number of shares outstanding .\n\nIt's important to note that different indexes may use different weightings; some might be market-cap weighted, where companies with a larger market capitalization influence the index more, while others might have equal weighting among the constituent companies. Points in a stock market index do not correspond to dollars or any specific currency value; instead, they're a relative measure that can be tracked over time to gauge market performance.

Here is a comparison based on an account from a user who has had experience with both:\n\n**Interactive Brokers:**\n- Known for real-time updates and services, offering daily, weekly, and monthly statements.\n- Charges are lower for trading fees compared to Questrade, unless you're trading very high volumes (800-1000+ shares), in which case costs per trade are usually around $1.\n- Does not charge fees for using its trading platform but passes on all other fees (e.g. data, order cancellation) to the client.\n- Does not offer registered accounts like TFSA or RRSP and has a minimum monthly fee of $10 or $3 for younger clients. If commission fees don't reach that amount, the balance is charged from your account.\n- Notably strong in forex trading.\n\n**Questrade:**\n- Had some issues in the past (2007-2009), but has shown constant improvement in services, with more user-friendly statements and responsive customer service.\n- Offers a monthly fee service for its QuestraderPRO and QuestraderELITE platforms, which includes data and flat rate commissions.\n- More suitable for clients looking to invest with fewer additional fees and who plan on making just a few trades a year.\n\nIn the end, the choice between IB and Questrade may come down to the type of trading you plan to do, the volume of your trades, and the importance of having registered account options like TFSA or RRSP. IB might be better suited for heavy traders who can justify the fees with their trading volume, while Questrade may appeal to those who prefer a cheaper, less trade-intensive investing approach .",

            "I have had accounts at both IB and Questrade. Whatever you've heard about Questrade, sadly much of it is true pertaining to 2007-2009. I have not had any issues with their service, and making the few trades I do with the QuestraderWEB service has been flawless. In the time that I've had the account, their service has constantly been improving (statements are easier to read, customer service is more responsive). You should read what FrugalTrader and Canadian Capitalist have to say along with the combined 1000+ comments before deciding. Interactive Brokers is a whole different world. Those guys are the definition of real-time. You can get daily and weekly statements, along with the typical monthly statements. Buying power, margin, etc, is all updated in real-time and viewable in their TWS software. Trading fees are definitely lower than Questrade unless you're routinely trading 800-1000+ shares. Most of my trades cost $1. Options have a lower limit before Questrade makes more sense. And nothing beats IB for forex. Ultimately it really depends on what you will be doing. Note that IB charges a minimum monthly fee of $10 ($3 if you're young and foolish). If you don't hit that with commissions, the balance is taken from your account. Also, all other fees are passed on to you (e.g. data, order cancellation). IB also doesn't have any registered accounts such as TFSA or RRSP, and doesn't plan to. If you'll be doing a bunch of hefty trading, IB offers a trading platform free of charge, but charges for everything else. Questrade instead has a monthly fee for its QuestraderPRO and QuestraderELITE services, but that includes data and flat rate commissions.

        "question": "Will there always be somebody selling/buying in every stock?",
        "answer": "There isn't necessarily always somebody actively buying or selling shares in every stock at any given moment. The liquidity of a stock\u2014how easy it is to buy or sell the stock without affecting its price\u2014varies depending on factors such as the size of the company, investor interest, and market conditions. Some stocks, especially those of large, well-known companies, are highly liquid and have many buyers and sellers at nearly all times during the trading day. Other stocks, especially those of smaller or less-known companies, may be less liquid, and there could be times when there are few or no buyers or sellers on the market.\n\nIn such illiquid markets, there can be significant gaps between the price at which sellers are willing to sell (ask price) and the price at which buyers are willing to buy (bid price), which is known as the bid-ask spread. If a stock is very illiquid, there might be periods when no trades occur because potential buyers and sellers cannot agree on a price.\n\nMarket makers and specialist firms are sometimes employed to ensure that there is always a buy and sell quote for a stock, but this does not guarantee that there will always be sufficient volume for an investor to trade the desired number of shares at these quoted prices. \n\nIf you have specific questions about how this works or are looking for information from the document you uploaded, please let me know so I can assist you further.",

You can usually tell if a stock has low liquidity by the small size of the average daily volume, the lack of order depth and the large size of the gap between bids and offers. So if a stock for example has last sale price of $0.50, has a highest bid price of $0.40 and a lowest offer price of $0.60, and an average daily volume of 10000 share, it is likely to be very illiquid.

            "\"Many people assume that if the price of something is $10 and they have 1,000 of that thing, they should expect to be able to sell them for something around $10,000.  Such an assumption may hold much of the time, but it doesn't always.  Worse, the cases where it fails to hold are often those where it would be relied upon most heavily.  Such an assumption should thus be considered dangerous. In a liquid market, the quantity of a something that people would be willing to buy at something close to the market price will be large relative to the quantity that people would seek to sell in the short term.  If at some moment in time one person in the market was willing to immediately buy 500 shares at $9.98 and another was willing to immediately buy 750 at $9.97, someone seeking to sell 1,000 shares could immediately receive $997.50 for them (selling 500 to the first person and 500 to the second, who would then be ready to buy 250 more from the first person who was willing to sell for $9.97).  Such behavior would be in line with what many people's assumptions. In an illiquid market, however, the quantity of something that people would be willing to buy near market price could be surprisingly low.  This is more often a problem in the marketplace of things like collectibles than of stocks, but the same thing can happen in the stock market.  If there's one potential buyer for a stock who thinks it's overpriced but has potential and would be worth $9.50, but that person only has $950 to spend, and nobody else thinks the stock would be worth more than $0.02/share, then until people sold a total of 100 shares the price would be $9.50, but after that the price would drop instantly to $0.02.  There would be no \"\"cushioning\"\" of the fall.  If the person with 1,000 shares was first in line, he'd get to sell 100 shares for $950 to the aforementioned seller, but would be unable to get more than $18 for the remaining 900. A major danger with markets is that markets which are perceived as liquid attract people to the buying side, while those which are seen as illiquid repel people.  The danger in the latter is obvious (having people flee a seemingly-illiquid market will reduce its liquidity further) but the former is just as bad.  Having people flock to a market because of its perceived liquidity will increase its liquidity, but can also create a \"\"false price floor\"\", causing demand to appear much stronger than it actually is.  Unless real demand increases to match the false price floor, the people who buy at the higher price will never be able to recoup their investment.\""

The theory suggests that by dividing a pension account (or any investment portfolio) into two equal parts and conducting separate coin tosses (investments) for each half, one can achieve better results in terms of both expected return and risk reduction.\n\nIn the example given, the original scenario with a single coin toss would provide an expected annualized return of 8.17% with a relatively high risk due to high standard deviation. However, when the account is split into two and each part is subjected to separate coin tosses, the calculated annualized return becomes 9.08%, which is almost a full percentage point higher than with a single coin toss. Moreover, the risk is reduced because two of the possible outcomes are at the mean return rate of 10%.\n\nThis demonstrates that diversification, in this case by dividing your assets and treating them separately, can provide a higher return with a lower associated risk. The key concept here is that dividing the portfolio between assets with uncorrelated or less correlated results can increase return while decreasing risk.

[...] you must pick   ahead of time one of two investment choices for the duration of your   employment: Certificates of deposit with a 3% annualized rate of return, or, A most peculiar option: At the end of each year Uncle Fred flips a coin.

This will be hereafter referred to as   \"\"Uncle Fred\u2019s coin toss,\"\" or simply, the \"\"coin toss.\"\" In effect, choosing option 2 results in a higher expected return than option 1, but it is certainly riskier, having a high standard deviation and being especially prone to a series of bad tosses.  Chapters 1 and 2 continue to expand on the idea of risk, and take a look at various assets/markets over time.  Chapter 3 then begins by introducing the multiple coin toss example: Time passes. You have spent several more years in the employ of your   Uncle Fred, and have truly grown to dread the annual coin-toss   sessions. [...] He makes you another offer. At the end of each year,   he will divide your pension account into two equal parts and conduct a   separate coin toss for each half [...] there are four possible   outcomes [...]: [...]   Being handy with numbers, you calculate that your annualized return   for this two-coin-toss sequence is 9.08%, which is nearly a full   percentage point higher than your previous expected return of 8.17%   with only one coin toss. Even more amazingly, you realize that your   risk has been reduced \u2014 with the addition of two returns at the   mean of 10%, your calculated standard deviation is now only 14.14%, as   opposed to 20% for the single coin toss. [...] Dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases return while decreasing risk. [...]   If the second coin toss were perfectly inversely correlated   with the first and always gave the opposite result [hence, outcomes   1 and 4 above never occurring], then our return would always be 10%.   In this case, we would have a 10% annualized long-term return with zero risk! I hope that summarizes the example well.  Of course, in the real world, one of the tricks to building a good portfolio is finding assets that aren't well-correlated, and if you're interested in more on the subject I suggest you check out his books (including The Four Pillars of Investing) and read more about Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).\"",

The rule is that true diversification does decrease risk. That is why you are advised to spread year investments across small-cap, large-cap, bonds, international, commodities, real estate. Getting two S&P 500 indexes isn't diversification.  Your mix of investments will still have risk, because return and risk are backward calculations, not a guarantee of future performance. Changes that were not anticipated will change future performance. What kind of changes: technology, outsourcing, currency, political, scandal.\""

The document further suggests considering trailing stop losses to protect gains, implying that selling shares does not have to be an all-or-nothing approach.\n\nIt's implied that the decisions on selling and re-purchasing should be based on the same research and judgment that led to the original purchase, taking into account the tax implications, your investment goals, and the specific situation of your investments .",

Although not explicitly labeled as \"Rules for Broker Behavior with Covered Calls,\" some key points regarding broker behavior in the context of covered calls are mentioned:\n\n1. The broker does not own the calls you sold and cannot exercise someone else\u2019s calls.\n2. A broker can take action to liquidate positions when you are in margin calls, but the scenario described in the document, where you are long stock and short calls (i.e., the calls are covered), would not generate a margin call. Therefore, if you haven't made other investments on margin that are generating calls, the broker has no right to act on your account.\n3. Covered calls have no risk to the broker; thus, the broker won't force you to buy the option back.\n4. The maximum return happens when the stock is called away at the strike price if the call option is exercised by the buyer.\n5. If the stock price is equal to the strike price of the call option (at-the-money), the owner of the call is more likely to sell the call and buy the stock in the market, as exercising it does not provide any economic benefit due to the absence of intrinsic value in the option.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the provided document segment  .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Number 2 cannot occur. You can buy the call back and sell the stock, but the broker won't force that #2 choice. To trade options, you must have a margin account. No matter how high the stock goes, once \"\"in the money\"\" the option isn't going to rise faster, so your margin % is not an issue.  And your example is a bit troublesome to me. Why would a $120 strike call spike to $22 with only a month left? You've made the full $20 on the stock rise and given up any gain after that. That's all. The call owner may exercise at any time. Edit: @jaydles is right, there are circumstances where an option price can increase faster than the stock price. Options pricing generally follows the Black-Scholes model. Since the OP gave us the current stock price, option strike price, and time to expiration, and we know the risk free rate is <1%, you can use the calculator to change volatility. The number two scenario won't occur, however, because a covered call has no risk to the broker, they won't force you to buy the option back, and the option buyer has no motive to exercise it as the entire option value is time premium.\"",
            "\"I think the question, as worded, has some incorrect assumptions built into it, but let me try to hit the key answers that I think might help: Your broker can't really do anything here.   Your broker doesn't own the calls you sold, and can't elect to exercise someone else's calls. Your broker can take action to liquidate positions when you are in margin calls, but the scenario you describe wouldn't generate them:  If you are long stock, and short calls, the calls are covered, and have no margin requirement.  The stock is the only collateral you need, and you can have the position on in a cash (non-margin) account.   So, assuming you haven't bought other things on margin that have gone south and are generating calls, your broker has no right to do anything to you. If you're wondering about the \"\"other guy\"\", meaning the person who is long the calls that you are short, they are the one who can impact you, by exercising their right to buy the stock from you.  In that scenario, you make $21, your maximum possible return (since you bought the stock at $100, collected $1 premium, and sold it for $120.  But they usually won't do that before expiration, and they pretty definitely won't here.  The reason they usually won't is that most options trade above their intrinsic value (the amount that they're in the money).    In your example, the options aren't in the money at all.   The stock is trading at 120, and the option gives the owner the right to buy at 120.* Put another way, exercising the option lets the owner buy the stock for the exact same price anyone with no options can in the market.  So, if the call has any value whatsoever, exercising it is irrational; the owner would be better off selling the call and buying the stock in the market.\""

        "answer": "The \"same day rule\" in the UK pertains to the matching of sales with purchases for tax purposes, specifically for calculating capital gains or losses. When you sell shares or securities, any gains or losses are matched first with purchases made on the same day. This is used for tax planning to crystallize a gain within the exempt amount and re-establish a purchase price at a higher level. The process often referred to as \"bed and breakfasting\" involves selling shares just before the market closes and buying them back the next day just after the market opens. This strategy is used to utilize the annual exemption each year and avoid paying taxes on what would otherwise be taxable gains .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The 'same day rule' in the UK is a rule for matching purposes only.  It says that sales on any day are matched firstly with purchases made on the same day for the purposes of ascertaining any gain/loss. Hence the phrase 'bed-and-breakfast' ('b&b') when you wish to crystalise a gain (that is within the exempt amount) and re-establish a purchase price at a higher level.  You do the sale on one day, just before the market closes, which gets matched with your original purchase, and then you buy the shares back the next day, just after the market opens.  This is standard tax-planning.  Whenever you have a paper gain, and you wish to lock that gain out of being taxed, you do a bed-and-breakfast transaction, the idea being to use up your annual exemption each and every year.  Of course, if your dealing costs are high, then they may outweigh any tax saved, and so it would be pointless. For the purpose of an example, let's assume that the UK tax year is the same as the calendar year. Scenario 1. Suppose I bought some shares in 2016, for a total price of Stg.50,000. Suppose by the end of 2016, the holding is worth Stg.54,000, resulting in a paper gain of Stg.4,000. Question.  Should I do a b&b transaction to make use of my Stg.11,100 annual exemption ? Answer.  Well, with transaction costs at 1.5% for a round-trip trade, suppose, and stamp duty on the purchase of 0.5%, your total costs for a b&b will be Stg1,080, and your tax saved (upon some future sale date) assuming you are a 20% tax-payer is 20%x(4,000-1,080) = Stg584 (the transaction costs are deductible, we assume).  This does not make sense. Scenario 2. The same as scenario 1., but the shares are worth Stg60,000 by end-2016. Answer.  The total transaction costs are 2%x60,000 = 1,200 and so the taxable gain of 10,000-1,200 = 8,800 would result in a tax bill of 20%x8,800 = 1,760 and so the transaction costs are lower than the tax to be saved (a strict analysis would take into account only the present value of the tax to be saved), it makes sense to crystalise the gain.  We sell some day before the tax year-end, and re-invest the very next day. Scenario 3. The same as scenario 1., but the shares are worth Stg70,000 by end-2016. Answer.  The gain of 20,000 less costs would result in a tax bill for 1,500 (this is: 20%x(20,000 - 2%x70,000 - 11,100) ).  This tax bill will be on top of the dealing costs of 1,400.  But the gain is in excess of the annual exemption.  The strategy is to sell just enough of the holding to crystallise a taxable gain of just 11,100. The fraction, f%, is given by: f%x(70,000-50,000) - 2%xf%x70,000 = 11,100 ... which simplifies to: f% = 11,100/18,600 = 59.68%. The tax saved is 20%x11,100 = 2,220, versus costs of 2%x59.58%x70,000 = 835.52. This strategy of partial b&b is adopted because it never makes sense to pay tax early ! End."

The key points about making money through CFDs according to the document are as follows:\n\n- CFDs allow for speculation on price movements of the underlying asset without owning the asset itself.\n- Profit or loss is made based on the difference in the price of the asset when the contract is opened and when it is closed.\n- There are two models for CFD providers: the market maker model and the direct market access model. In the market maker model, the provider takes the other side of the bet, similar to spread betting. In the direct market access model, the provider connects you to another CFD trader, acting as an intermediary.\n- If nobody is betting in the opposite direction to your position in a direct market access model, you will not be able to trade, as a counter party is needed for the contract.\n- Unlike owning actual stocks, holding a CFD does not grant benefits such as dividend payments or rights to attend shareholder meetings, as you do not own the underlying asset.\n- It's important to note that CFDs trade 'over-the-counter' and not on centralized and regulated exchanges, which is one of the reasons they are not permitted in the US.\n\nIt is important for any potential investor or trader to understand these aspects before engaging in CFD trading.

            "\"What is being described in Longson's answer, though helpful, is perhaps more similar to a financial spread bet. Exactly like a bookmaker, the provider of a spread bet takes the other side of the bet, and is counter party to your \"\"trade\"\". A CFD is also a bet between two parties. Now, if the CFD provider uses a market maker model, then this is exactly the same as with a spread bet and the provider is the counter party. However, if the provider uses a direct market access model then the counter party to your contract is another CFD trader, and the provider is just acting as an intermediary to bring you together (basically doing the job of both a brokerage and an exchange). A CFD entered into through a direct market access provider is in many ways similar to a Futures contract. Critically though, the contract is traded 'over-the-counter' and not on any centralized and regulated exchange. This is the reason that CFDs are not permitted in the US - the providers are not authorized as exchanges. Whichever model your CFD provider uses, it is best to think of the contract as a 'bet' on the future price movements of the underlying stock or commodity, in much the same way as with any other derivative instrument such as futures, forwards, swaps, or options. Finally, note that because you don't actually own the underlying stock (just as Longson has highlighted) you won't be entitled to any of the additional benefits that can come with ownership of a stock, such as dividend payments or the right to attend shareholder meetings. RESPONSE TO QUESTION So if I understand correctly, the money gained through a direct market access model comes from other investors in the same CFD who happened to have invested in the \"\"wrong\"\" direction the asset was presumed to take. What happens then, if no one is betting in the opposite direction of my investment. Your understanding is correct. If literally nobody is betting in the opposite direction to you, then you will not be able to trade. This is true for any derivative market; if suddenly every single buyer were to remove their bids from the S&P futures, then no seller would be able to sell. This is a very extreme scenario, as the S&P futures market is incredibly liquid (loads of buyers and sellers at all times).  However, if something like this does happen (the flash crash of 2010, for example), then the centralized futures exchanges such as the CME have safeguards in place - the market become locked-limit so that it can only fall so far, there may be no buyers below the lock limit price, but the market cannot fall through it. CFD providers are not obliged to provide such safeguards, which is why regulators in the US don't permit them to operate. It may be the case that if you're trying to buy a CFD for a thinly traded and ill-liquid stock there will be no seller available. One possibility is that the provider will offer a 'hybrid' model, and in the absence of an independent counter party they will take the opposite side of your bet, and then offset their risk by taking an opposing position in the underlying stock.\"",
            "A CFD is like a bet. Bookies don't own horses or racetracks but you still pay them and they pay you if the horses win. If you buy a CFD the money goes to the firm you bought it from and if the stock price changes in your favour, they will pay you. However, if it goes against you they may ask you for more money than you originally invested to cover your losses. Constacts for difference are derivatives, i.e. you gain on the change in the price or delta of something rather than on its absolute value. Someone bets one way and is matched with someone (or perhaps more than one) betting the other way. Both parties are bound by the contract to pay or be payed on the outcome. One will win and the other will necessarily lose.  It's similar in concept to a spread bet, although spread bets often have a fixed timescale whereas CFDs do not and CFDs generally operate via the payment of a commission rather than via charges included in the spread. There's more information on both CFDs and spread betting here If somone has a lot of CFDs that might affect the stock price if it's known about as others may buy/sell real stock to either make the CFD pay or may it not pay depending on whether they think they can make money on it.

        "answer": "When considering whether to sell or hold stocks acquired through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), there are several factors you should consider. \n\nThe primary advantage of selling immediately, especially if there is no required holding period, is that it's essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk. The discount you receive by participating in the ESPP acts as an immediate return on your investment. However, there are potential downsides, such as the time it may take to receive the shares at your brokerage, during which an earnings report could impact the share prices negatively. There is also the consideration that having money withheld for ESPP contributions means it's not available for other uses, even though it's for a virtual guarantee return, and this can complicate your taxes somewhat .\n\nIf you're able to sell your ESPP shares immediately at grant, it's generally considered a no-brainer as you lock in the discount as profit. However, you'll need to consider the stock's volatility if there's a delay in receiving your shares to determine the potential for loss. The tax implications can also be a con, as the discounted portion is taxed as ordinary income, and any change in the stock price between receipt and sale would qualify as a capital gain or loss .\n\nThere are also tax implications depending on how long you hold onto the stock. For example, in the US, if you sell the stock before a certain period (usually two years), your profits, including the discount, may be taxed as ordinary income, which is typically higher than long-term capital gains tax rates .\n\nAnother perspective to consider is diversification. Some advise against holding onto investments in your employing company as you're already exposed to the company's fortunes through your job. If the company faces difficulties, not only might the stock's value decrease, but your job security could also be affected .\n\nUltimately, your decision should be informed by your financial goals, risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and tax situation. It also may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who understands the specifics of your financial picture and ESPP terms. Always carefully review the terms of your ESPP before making decisions, as the specifics can vary widely from one plan to another.",

Under other circumstances, the ideal amount of company stock is probably 0%. But there are tax benefits to waiting, as you've noted, and if you're reasonably confident that the stock isn't likely to jerk around too much, and you have a high risk tolerance (i.e. lots of extra savings besides this), and you're comfortable shouldering the risk of losing some money, it might make sense to hold onto the stock for a year - but never any longer. The real risk to holding a lot of company stock doesn't depend on how often you buy it and sell it per se, but having period purchases every month should make it easier for you to ladder the funds, and regularly sell your old shares as you purchase new shares. You might also consider a stop-loss order on the stock at or near the price you purchased it at. If the stock is at $100, then you buy at $85, and then the stock drops to $85, there are no more outstanding tax benefits and it makes no sense to have it as part of your portfolio instead of any other speculative instrument - you probably get better diversification benefits with any other speculative instrument, so your risk-adjusted returns would be higher.",

        "question": "What's the formula for profits and losses when I delta hedge?",
        "answer": "The formula for calculating profits and losses when delta hedging is not straightforward but can be generally described as follows: If you buy a call option today and short the underlying stock by the delta amount, the value of your position will be the value of your options less the value of the stock you are short. This calculation does not include the premium paid for the option since that is a sunk cost, though it is reflected in your profit or loss. To calculate your profit or loss (PnL) over a period, you subtract what you paid for your current portfolio value from the end value of your portfolio, which is the money you received from shorting the underlying stocks less the premium you paid for the options.\n\nCapital gains and losses also need to be considered; they offset each other first, with net gains being taxed at the applicable rate. If there's a net loss, it can be offset against other income, up to $3,000. Gains and losses must be categorized into long-term and short-term before they are netted against each other on the tax return. The final net gain or loss is then reported on Form 1040.\n\nHowever, this general description omits specific numbers and tax implications which can vary based on the individual case, so for an accurate calculation you should consult with a financial advisor or tax professional, especially to understand the tax treatment of any profits or losses incurred through hedging activities.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "You don't mention any specific numbers, so I'll answer in generalities. Say I buy a call option today, and I short the underlying stock with the delta. The value will be the value of the option you bought less the value of the stock you are short. (your premium is not included in the value since it's a sunk cost, but is reflected in your profit/loss) So, say I go out and adjust my portfolio, so I am still delta short in the underlying. It's still the value of your options, less the value of the underlying you are short. What is my PnL over this period? The end value of your portfolio less what you paid for that value, namely the money you received shorting the underlyings less the premium you paid for the option."

        "question": "Can another tax loss be used to offset capital gains taxes? How does it work?",
        "answer": "Yes, a tax loss can be used to offset capital gains taxes. The process involves first categorizing capital gains and losses as either long-term or short-term, depending on how long the taxpayer held the property. Short-term refers to assets held for one year or less, while long-term refers to those held for more than one year. These gains and losses are then netted against each other within their respective categories. Afterward, the net long-term gain or loss is offset against the net short-term gain or loss. The final net number, which may be a net capital gain or loss, is then reported on the tax return (Form 1040).\n\nFor example, if you have a net long-term capital gain and a net short-term capital loss, these will offset each other. If the net long-term gain is larger than the net short-term loss, the result is a net capital gain, which will be taxed. Conversely, if the net long-term capital gain is less than the net short-term loss, you end up with a net capital loss, which can be used to offset other income up to $3,000. If there's still a remaining loss, it may be carried over to subsequent tax years.\n\nBe aware that the rules for tax loss offsetting are subject to specific IRS regulations and thresholds. Therefore, consulting a tax professional or an accountant for personalized advice is recommended before making any decisions or filing your tax return .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Capital gains and losses offset each other first, then your net gain is taxed at the applicable rate. If you have a net loss, you can offset your other income by up to $3,000. In your example, you have no net-gain or loss, so no tax implications from your activity.",
            "Capital losses do mirror capital gains within their holding periods. An asset or investment this is certainly held for a year into the day or less, and sold at a loss, will create a short-term capital loss. A sale of any asset held for over a year to your day, and sold at a loss, will create a loss that is long-term. When capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return, the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term, and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories. Then the gains that are long-term losses are netted against each other, therefore the same is done for short-term gains and losses. Then your net gain that is long-term loss is netted against the net short-term gain or loss. This final net number is then reported on Form 1040. Example Frank has the following gains and losses from his stock trading for the year: Short-term gains - $6,000 Long-term gains - $4,000 Short-term losses - $2,000 Long-term losses - $5,000 Net short-term gain/loss - $4,000 ST gain ($6,000 ST gain - $2,000 ST loss) Net long-term gain/loss - $1,000 LT loss ($4,000 LT gain - $5,000 LT loss) Final net gain/loss - $3,000 short-term gain ($4,000 ST gain - $1,000 LT loss)   Again, Frank can only deduct $3,000 of final net short- or long-term losses against other types of income for that year and must carry forward any remaining balance."

        "question": "How do I analyse moving averages?",
        "answer": "Analyzing moving averages involves observing and interpreting the average price data of a security over a specific period. Here's a brief overview of how to analyze moving averages based on the information found in the document:\n\n- **Trend Identification**: Moving averages are commonly used to identify the trend direction. If the price is below a particular simple moving average (SMA), such as the 20-day SMA, and continues to decline, it suggests a bearish trend. Conversely, if the price is above the SMA and rising, it often indicates a bullish trend.\n\n- **Crossovers**: When short-period average lines cross over long-period average lines, it can signal a change in trend. Once a new trend begins and the SMA of the shortest average period (e.g., 20 days) leads above a longer period average (e.g., 90 days), it may be considered a time to enter a position if you are following a trend-following strategy.\n\n- **Overlapping Averages**: When moving averages overlap, it can be a sign of potential trend reversals. This condition is something to watch for if you're considering making a trade.\n\n- **Technical Analysis**: Some traders use moving averages with the assumption that prices will revert to the mean. A price significantly above a moving average might suggest an overpriced stock, and one below might indicate an underpriced stock. A short-term moving average above the long-term moving average might indicate upward momentum, though opinions on this can vary among traders.\n\n- **Lag Factor**: It is essential to remember that moving averages are lagging indicators, meaning they are based on past price data. A simple moving average (SMA), especially over a more extended period like 200 days, might reflect price actions that are outdated, making real-time decisions less effective.\n\n- **Price Adjustments**: Moving averages can be adjusted to reflect different price points, such as opening, high, low, or closing prices, which can offer more nuances to analysts when charted in software with candlestick mode.\n\n- **Technical Analysis Controversy**: There is debate within the financial community about the effectiveness of technical analysis, which includes using moving averages. Some studies suggest that, after accounting for transaction costs, strategies based on technical indicators like moving averages might not lead to consistent profitability.\n\nRemember, these are general guidelines, and the effectiveness of moving averages can vary depending on the market conditions, the particular security being analyzed, and the individual trading strategy .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Moving Average is mere average line based on historical period; broadly use to view the trend. But it has no relation to price action in due future course. If price is going below 20 SMA then in near future even the SMA will start directing toward south. In your case if price has fallen below all the short period average lines and long period average line then it is bearish in nature. Soon in few days you may find 20 SMA leading downwards followed by closest period and then long. Also SMA and EMA can best be observed in charting software in candlestick mode. Because these moving averages can also be adjusted and viewed based on Opening price, High prices, Low Price or closing price. In you case I guess the data is of closing price data. Overlapping of averages may be sign of reversals. So if you want to buy this stock you may have to wait till all the average lines cross-over and when new trend begins with SMA of shortest avg period (20) leading above the long avg period (90 days in your case). Then you can buy and just follow the trend. I hope it answers you question.",
            "One could use technical indicators in any number of ways...they aren't rigidly defined for use in any particular way.  If they were, only computers would use them. Having said that, moving averages are frequently used by people operating on the assumption that short-term price movements will soon be reverted back to a longer-term mean.  So if the price shoots up today, traders who use moving averages may believe it will come back down pretty soon.  If this is the belief (and it usually is for this type of trader), a price significantly above a moving average could indicate an overpriced stock.  A price below the moving average could indicate an underpriced stock. Similarly, a short-term moving average above the long-term moving average may indicate an overpriced stock.  When you are dealing with more than one frequency, though, there is more disagreement about how to use technical indicators.  Some traders would probably say the opposite: that a short term average above the long term average indicates an upward movement that will continue because they believe the stock has momentum. Note that I am not saying I believe in using these averages to predict mean reversion or momentum effects, just that traders who rely on moving averages frequently do.",
            "If you are going to be a long term investor you are only going to buy and hold. You will not sell. Thus future price is not relevant. Only dividend payout is relevant. Divide the dividend by the price you paid to get the yeald.  Edit:  once again the sitesite will not allow me to add a comment, so I have to edit a previous post...  What you call 'active investor' is not really investing, it is speculating. When you try to 'buy low, sell high' you have, at best, a 50-50 chance of picking the low. You then pay a commission on that buy. After you buy then you have a 50-50 chance, at best, of picking the high. You also have to pay the commission on the sell. 50% times 50% is 25%.So you have, at best a 25% chance of buying low and selling high. You are churning your account which makes money for the broker whether you make money or not. If, instead, you buy and hold a dividend paying security then the going price is irrelevant. You paid for the security once and do not have to pay for it again. Meanwhile the dividends roll in forever. 'Buy low, sell high' is a fools game. Warren Buffet does not do it, he buys and holds."

        "question": "How come we can find stocks with a Price-to-Book ratio less than 1?",
        "answer": "Stocks with a Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio less than 1 are available in the market for a number of reasons. The P/B ratio is a financial metric used to compare a company's current market price to its book value. A P/B ratio under 1 can suggest that the stock is undervalued, meaning the market price is less than the company's reported net asset value per share. Here are some reasons why a stock might trade with a P/B ratio less than 1:\n\n1. Market sentiment: Poor market sentiment towards a company or industry can lead to lower stock prices, regardless of the underlying book value.\n\n2. Expected poor performance: Investors may expect that the company will perform poorly in the future, which can drive the stock price down.\n\n3. Accounting practices: The book value may not reflect the true market value of the assets if they are overvalued on the books.\n\n4. Obsolete or inefficient assets: The company may hold assets that are obsolete or inefficient, which the market does not value highly, even though they are carried at significant value in the financial statements.\n\n5. Cyclical or declining industries: Companies in cyclical industries or industries that are in decline might have assets that have a lower market value than the book value.\n\n6. Company-specific problems: Issues such as management problems, legal challenges, or operational failures can lead to a decline in stock prices.\n\n7. Financial distress: Companies experiencing financial distress or are close to bankruptcy may have a low P/B ratio as their future is uncertain.\n\nIf you wish to find specific details related to stocks or P/B ratios from the document you uploaded, I can use my file browsing tool to find more concrete information.

Lets say last year when oil was $100 per barrel a bunch of companies saw a good return and put $ 100 million into a bunch of leases, boreholes, pumps, &c to return $10 million per year, and the market says yeah, they're all together worth 100M. Now oil is less, maybe $40 per the link.  These exploration companies don't have a lot of labor or variable costs; they are operationally profitable, may have \"\"use it or lose it\"\" leases or minimum pumping requirements for contract or engineering reasons.

        "question": "Do investors go long option contracts when they cannot cover the exercise of the options?",
        "answer": "Investors might go long on option contracts even when they cannot cover the exercise of those options for several reasons. \n\nFirst, investors may anticipate that the market value of the underlying stock will move in a favorable direction before the option expires, allowing them to sell the option for a profit without having to exercise it. This is often the case because the value of the option is not just determined by the intrinsic value \u2014 that is, the difference between the stock price and the strike price \u2014 but also by the time value, which represents the potential for the stock price to become more favorable over time .\n\nAlso, long options provide leverage, which means an investor can control a significant amount of stock for a relatively small investment (the cost of the option). If the stock moves favorably, the return on this investment can be substantial compared to the initial outlay. Since the most an investor can lose is the premium paid for the option, this could be an attractive risk/reward proposition.\n\nLastly, there is a concept known as \"covered calls\" where an investor owns the stock and sells a call option to generate income, with the risk being limited to the difference between the stock's purchase price and the strike price of the sold option minus the premium received. However, if the investor doesn't own the underlying stock and the stock price rises significantly, the potential loss is theoretically unlimited because they would need to buy the stock at the current high price to deliver it to the option's holder .\n\nInvestors who go long on options without the ability to cover the exercise do so primarily for speculative reasons, betting that they can profit from price movements of the underlying asset without actually having to exercise the option (i.e., they don't intend to acquire the underlying assets but hope to sell the option itself at a higher price).\n\nIn conclusion, going long on options without the capability to cover the exercise might be part of a broader investment strategy that accounts for the risk of not being able to exercise the option. This strategy includes leveraging time value and market movements to profit without the exercise ever being necessary.",

Put it on your calendar and don't forget, you could loose your profits. @#2 Its in the best interest of your broker to exercise because they get a commission. I think they are used to this situation where there is a lack of funds. Its not like bouncing a check. You will need to check with your broker on this. @#3 I think many or most options traders never intend on buying the underling stock. Therefore no, they do not always make sure there is enough funds to buy.",
            "I do this often and have never had a problem.  My broker is TD Ameritrade and they sent several emails (and even called and left a message) the week of expiry to remind me I had in the money options that would be expiring soon. Their policy is to automatically exercise all options that are at least $.01 in the money.  One email was vaguely worded, but it implied that they could liquidate other positions to raise money to exercise the options.  I would have called to clarify but I had no intention of exercising and knew I would sell them before expiry. In general though, much like with margin calls, you should avoid being in the position where the broker needs to (or can do) anything with your account. As a quick aside:  I can't think of a scenario where you wouldn't be able to sell your options, but you probably are aware of the huge spreads that exist for many illiquid options.  You'll be able to sell them, but if you're desperate, you may have to sell at the bid price, which can be significantly (25%?) lower than the ask.  I've found this to be common for options of even very liquid underlyings.  So personally, I find myself adjusting my limit price quite often near expiry.  If the quote is, say, 3.00-3.60, I'll try to sell with a limit of 3.40, and hope someone takes my offer.  If the price is not moving up and nobody is biting, move down to 3.30, 3.20, etc. In general you should definitely talk to your broker, like others have suggested.  You may be able to request that they sell the options and not attempt to exercise them at the expense of other positions you have."

        "question": "What explains the enormous increase in gold price in the early 21st century?",
        "answer": "The substantial increase in gold price in the early 21st century can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. **Economic and Financial Volatility**: Since 2007, the world has experienced significant economic and financial fluctuations, including the deepest recession since the 1930s. Despite this, gold's price has performed strongly, approximately doubling since the global financial crisis began in mid-2007.\n\n2. **Gold and Real Interest Rates**: Real interest rates are a factor that influences gold prices. Because gold itself does not yield any returns, the opportunity cost of holding gold is affected by real interest rates. When real interest rates increase, the opportunity cost of holding gold increases, whereas it decreases when real interest rates fall.\n\n3. **Gold and the US Dollar**: The value of the US dollar has been a significant driver of short-term gold price movements. In 2008, the IMF estimated that between 40-50% of the changes in gold price since 2002 were related to the dollar, with a 1% change in the dollar's value resulting in more than a 1% change in the gold price.\n\n4. **Financial Stress**: Gold is often seen as a safe haven during financial uncertainty. In periods of financial stress, the demand for gold may rise for various reasons.\n\n5. **Political Instability**: Concerns over wars, civil conflicts, and international tensions can lead to increased demand for gold. Gold\u2019s potential function as a \"currency of last resort\" in the event of serious system collapse offers a particular incentive to hold it during severe political situations.\n\n6. **Official Sector Activity**: The behavior of central banks and other official entities can significantly impact gold prices. Central banks hold a significant amount of gold, and their policies on gold sales and purchases can influence the market.\n\nThese interrelated factors, including macroeconomic conditions, monetary policies, geopolitical issues, and market speculation, have all played a role in the rising price of gold during that time.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Since 2007 the world has seen a period of striking economic and financial volatility featuring the deepest recession since the 1930s despite this gold has performed strongly with its price roughly doubling since the global financial crisis began in mid-2007. 1. Gold and real interest rates: One of the factor that influences gold prices is real interest rate which is to some extent related to inflation. Since gold lacks a yield of its own, the opportunity cost of holding gold increases with a real interest rate increase and decreases with a fall in real interest rates. 2. Gold and the US dollar: The external value of the US dollar has been a significant influence on short-term gold price movements. The IMF estimated6 in 2008 that 40-50% of the moves in the gold price   since 2002 were dollar-related, with a 1% change in the effective   external value of the dollar leading to a more than 1% change in the   gold price (Source).  3. Gold and financial stress: It is a significant and commonly observed influence on the short-term price of gold. In periods of financial stress gold demand may rise for a number of   reasons:  4. Gold and political instability: It is another factor that can boost gold prices. Investor concerns about wars, civil conflicts and international   tensions can boost demand for gold for similar reasons to those noted   above for periods of financial stress. Gold\u201fs potential function as a   \u201ecurrency of last resort\u201f in case of serious system collapse provides   a particular incentive to hold it in case the political situation is   especially severe. (Source) 5. Gold and official sector activity: The behaviour of central banks and other parts of the official sector can have an important impact on gold prices.  One reason for this is that central banks are big holders of gold,   possessing some 30,500 metric tons in 2010, which is approximately 15%   of all above-ground gold stocks. As a result, central bank policies on   gold sales and purchases can have significant effects, and these   policies have been subject to considerable shifts over the decades.

        "question": "What margin is required to initiate and maintain a short sale",
        "answer": "When initiating a short sale, there are two types of margins that are typically required: initial margin and variation margin.\n\n**Initial Margin:**\nThis is a \"good faith\" deposit required by the broker to ensure that the trader is acting in good faith and fully intends to meet any potential losses that might occur. This amount is not debited from the trader's cash account but is segregated by the broker and cannot be used to fund other trades. This margin will be released once the short position is closed.\n\n**Variation Margin:**\nThis is the running profit or loss being incurred on the short position and must be maintained while holding the position. It is netted with the initial margin to come up with the total margin requirement. Margin requirements are usually calculated at the close of each trading day. If there is a loss, additional margin funds may be required to maintain the margin level; if there is a profit, some funds will be released from segregation.\n\nFor example, if a trader sells 200 shares at $20 each, and the price moves to $21, the trader will incur a debit of $200 on the variation margin. Conversely, if the price drops to $19, a credit of $200 is applied to the variation margin. To maintain the margin requirement (given as $6000 in the example), the trader will need to top up or have funds released based on the profitability of the short position on a given trading day .\n\nIf you need more specific numbers related to margin requirements for a particular broker or financial instrument, you may need to consult the brokerage firm's policies or regulatory requirements of the relevant financial authority. The details can vary depending on the market and the broker's risk management policies.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Depends on the stock involved, but for the most part brokerages allow you gain entry at 50%, meaning you can short twice the cash on hand you have.   Going forward, you need to maintain 30%, so on a $10,000 short, you'd have to maintain $3000 in your account. Example, an account with $5000 cash - You can short $10,000 securities.  Let say 100 shares of xyz at $100 per share. After trade settles, you won't receive a margin call until your balance falls to $3000, probably right around the time xyz rises to $120 per share.  Riskier stocks will have higher margin maintenance requirements - leveraged vehicles like FAS/FAZ (triple leveraged) require 90% margin (3x30%) if they are allowed to be 'shorted' at all."

        "answer": "The information from the retrieved document discusses various aspects of trading and investing, including the effects of non-market hours on trades. Technical analysts and traders must account for the lower liquidity during pre-market and post-market sessions, as only limit orders are allowed, not market orders, to avoid trades filling at undesirable prices. Brokers may also require express specification for orders to be executed outside regular trading hours, such as marking them as \"Ext\" for extended hours. This can mean that significant moves in stock prices or in the expectation of market trends could happen outside of the standard market hours, which technical analysts need to monitor and potentially react to . \n\nTechnical analysts often scrutinize pre-market and post-market trading for clues about how the market may open or react the following day. Positive or negative news, earnings reports released after the bell, and other such events can cause significant price movements during these off-hours. Analysts would analyze these movements in the context of existing trends, patterns, and indicators to adjust their strategies and forecasts accordingly.\n\nIn summary, technical analysts should stay vigilant during non-market hours as events and trading during these times can influence market sentiment and the pricing of securities when the market reopens.",

        "question": "How do I track investment performance in Quicken across rollovers?",
        "answer": "Tracking investment performance in Quicken across rollovers, particularly in the context of IRAs and Roth conversions, can be intricate due to the tax implications involved. Rollovers from a traditional IRA to another traditional IRA or to a Roth IRA are limited in frequency, and non-trustee rollovers (those that are not a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer) can be particularly complex. For instance, the source trustee may withhold a portion of the distribution, which you would need to compensate for with non-IRA funds. Additionally, there is a 60-day window to complete such a rollover, and missing this deadline can lead to early-withdrawal penalties, barring certain exceptions.\n\nYou can technically take money out of your traditional IRA on December 31st and hold it for 60 days before deciding to complete the rollover. If you decide to move it to another traditional IRA, it is not a taxable event. However, if you roll it over into a Roth IRA, it is considered a conversion and the tax implications for that event are considered to have occurred in December of the year the distribution was taken. \n\nRegarding the tracking within Quicken, you would need to enter these events carefully to reflect both the withdrawal and the rollover, as well as any tax implications if it's a Roth conversion. Furthermore, if you encounter a situation where you need to \"undo\" a Roth conversion, which is referred to as a recharacterization, this must be done by October 15th of the year following the original conversion and it has its own tax calculations if the funds are converted into a new empty Roth account versus an existing Roth account with a previous balance.\n\nTo appropriately track this in Quicken, you might need to consult a detailed guide within Quicken's documentation that specifically addresses the handling of rollovers and conversions. Unfortunately, the file provided doesn't seem to have detailed information on Quicken's procedures for this.

        "question": "If I invest in securities denominated in a foreign currency, should I hedge my currency risk?",
        "answer": "Whether you should hedge your currency risk when investing in securities denominated in a foreign currency depends on several factors, including your investment horizon, risk tolerance, and expectations about future currency movements.\n\nThe decision to hedge currency risk is nuanced and varies for each investor. Hedging can protect against unfavorable currency moves which could erode investment returns when converted back to the investor's home currency. For instance, if you expect that the US Dollar will strengthen, it might be wise to lock in some kind of hedge to offset the potential loss when converting your foreign currency investment back to US Dollars .\n\nOn the other hand, hedging is not always necessary or cost-effective, especially for individuals or small to medium businesses. A perfect hedge is unusual, and arranging such a hedge can involve complications and costs that may not be justified by the benefits. Moreover, some investors might prefer not to hedge as they have a diversified portfolio with both domestic and international investments that could naturally balance out the currency risk exposure .\n\nThere are also investment vehicles like currency-hedged ETFs that may offer a more cost-efficient way to mitigate currency risk than setting up individual futures contracts. These ETFs have higher expense ratios than non-hedged ETFs because they include the costs of the hedging contracts .\n\nThe correct answer as to whether you should hedge your currency risk might ultimately be \"maybe.\" It would depend on your personal financial goals, the composition of your investments, and how those investments match against your future expenses, which may or may not be affected by currency fluctuations .\n\nTherefore, you should consider your unique situation carefully. If you expect to incur expenses or retire in a currency that your investments are not denominated in, or if your investments are heavily weighted towards markets that may be affected by your home currency's strength, then hedging could be more relevant. If you desire to ensure that your portfolio's performance is not dependent on currency moves, then hedging could be appropriate . It is recommended to consult with a financial advisor who can provide advice tailored to your specific financial circumstances.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Like most other investment decisions - it depends. Specifically in this case it depends upon your view of the FX (Foreign Exchange) market over the next few years, and how sensitive you are to losses. As you correctly note, a hedge has a cost, so it detracts from your overall return. But given that you need to repatriate the investment eventually to US Dollars, you need to be aware of the fluctuations of the dollar versus other currencies. If you believe that over your time horizon, the US dollar will be worth the same as now or less, then you should not buy the hedge.  If the dollar is the same - the choice is/was obvious.  If you believe the US dollar will be weaker in the future, that means that when you repatriate back to US dollars, you will purchase more dollars with your foreign currency. If on the other hand, you believe the US Dollar will get stronger, then you should certainly lock in some kind of hedge.  That way, when your foreign currency would have effectively bought fewer US, you will have made money on the hedge to make up the difference. If you choose not to hedge now, you can likely hedge that exposure at any time in the future, separate from the initial investment purchase buy buying/selling the appropriate FX instrument. Good Luck",
            "\"No.  This is too much for most individuals, even some small to medium businesses.  When you sell that investment, and take the cheque into the foreign bank and wire it back to the USA in US dollars, you will definitely obtain the final value of the investment, converted to US$. Thats what you wanted, right?  You'll get that.  If you also hedge, unless you have a situation where it is a perfect hedge, then you are gambling on what the currencies will do. A perfect hedge is unusual for what most individuals are involved in. It looks something like this:  you know ForeignCorp is going to pay you 10 million quatloos on Dec 31.  So you go to a bank (probably a foreign bank, I've found they have lower limits for this kind of transaction and more customizable than what you might create trading futures contracts), and tell them, \"\"I have this contract for a 10 million quatloo receivable on Dec 31, I'd like to arrange a FX forward contract and lock in a rate for this in US$/quatloo.\"\"  They may have a credit check or a deposit for such an arrangement, because as the rates change either the bank will owe you money or you will owe the bank money. If they quote you 0.05 US$/quatloo, then you know that when you hand the cheque over to the bank your contract payment will be worth US$500,000.  The forward rate may differ from the current rate, thats how the bank accounts for risk and includes a profit. Even with a perfect hedge, you should be able to see the potential for trouble.  If the bank doesnt quite trust you, and hey, banks arent known for trust, then as the quatloo strengthens relative to the US$, they may suspect that you will walk away from the deal.  This risk can be reduced by including terms in the contract requiring you to pay the bank some quatloos as that happens.  If the quatloo falls you would get this money credited back to your account.  This is also how futures contracts work; there it is called \"\"mark to market accounting\"\".  Trouble lurks here.  Some people, seeing how they are down money on the hedge, cancel it.  It is a classic mistake because it undoes the protection that one was trying to achieve.  Often the rate will move back, and the hedger is left with less money than they would have had doing nothing, even though they bought a perfect hedge.\"",
            "As the other answer already states, whether you should or shouldn't currency-hedge your equity investments depends on a lot of factors. If you decide to do so, depending on your investment vehicles, there might be a more cost-efficient way than arranging a separate futures contract with a bank: If you are open to (or are already investing in) ETFs, there are currency-hedged versions of some popular ETFs. These are hedged against the currency risk for a specific currency; for example, if you are buying in (and expecting to sell for) USD, you would buy an ETF hedged to USD. Of course they have a higher expense ratio than non-hedged ETFs since the costs of the necessary contracts are included in the expenses.",
            "So far we have a case for yes and no.  I believe the correct answer is... maybe. You mention that most of your expenses are in dollars which is definitely correct, but there is an important complication that I will try to simplify greatly here.  Many of the goods you buy are priced on the international market (a good example is oil) or are made from combinations of these goods.  When the dollar is strong the price of oil is low but when the dollar is weak the price of oil is high. However, when you buy stuff like services (think a back massage) then you pay the person in dollars and the person you are paying just wants dollars so the strength of the dollar doesn't really matter. Most people's expenses are a mix of things that are priced internationally and locally with a bias toward local expenses.  If they also have a mix of investments some of which are international and depend on the strength of the dollar and some are domestic and do not, then they don't have to worry much about the strength/weakness of the dollar later when they sell their investments and buy what they want.  If the dollar is weak than the international goods will be more expensive, but at the same time international part of their portfolio will be worth more. If you plan on retiring in a different country or have 100% of your investments in emerging market stocks than it is worth thinking about either currency hedging or changing your investment mix.  However, for many people a good mix of domestic and international investments covers much of the risk that their currency will weaken while offering the benefits of diversification.  The best part is you don't need to guess if the dollar will get stronger or weaker. tl;dr: If you want your portfolio to not depend on currency moves then hedge.  If you want your retirement to not depend on currency moves then have a good mix of local and unhedged international investments."

        "question": "Selling non-dividend for dividend stocks",
        "answer": "Selling non-dividend stocks to buy dividend stocks is an investment strategy that some investors employ for various reasons. In the document provided, there is information about different types of stocks, dividends, and how they can impact investment decisions.\n\nNon-dividend stocks do not pay out dividends and are typically considered as growth stocks. They reinvest earnings to fund growth, and investors profit mainly through the stock's price appreciation. Dividend stocks, on the other hand, provide shareholders with regular income in the form of dividends, in addition to potential price appreciation. Dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits .\n\nThe decision to switch from non-dividend to dividend stocks might be driven by the desire for a more predictable income stream, or as part of a broader investment plan aimed at achieving a certain allocation or diversification ratio.\n\nOne advantage of dividend stocks is the possibility of reinvesting the dividends to buy more stock in the company, which can lead to compounding growth over time. Some investors favor this approach as a way to build wealth, especially when utilizing Dividend ReInvestment Plans (DRIPs) .\n\nIt should be noted, when selling stocks and switching to an alternative investment, consideration should be given to several factors, including the tax implications of selling, the stability and financial health of the companies offering dividends, the investor's risk tolerance, and overall portfolio balance.\n\nIn summary, whether or not it's a good idea to sell non-dividend stocks and invest in dividend stocks depends on individual financial goals and market conditions. Investors often weigh the total return, which comprises both the dividend yield and capital growth, to determine the potential performance of their investment . As always, it's recommended to conduct thorough research or consult with a financial advisor before making any significant changes to one's investment portfolio.",

        "ground_truth": [
            "\"(See also the question How many stocks I can exercise per stock warrant? and my comments there). Clearly, at the prices you quote, it does not seem sensible to exercise your warrants at the moment, since you can still by \"\"units\"\" (1 stock + 1/3 warrant) and bare stock at below the $11.50 it would cost you to exercise your warrant.  So when would exercising a warrant become \"\"a sensible thing to do\"\"? Obviously, if the price of the bare stock (which you say is currently $10.12) were to sufficiently exceed $11.50, then it would clearly be worth exercising a warrant and immediately selling the stock you receive (\"\"sufficiently exceed\"\" to account for any dealing costs in selling the newly-acquired stock). However, looking more closely, $11.50 isn't the correct \"\"cut-off\"\" price. Consider three of the units you bought at $10.26 each. For $30.78 you received three shares of stock and one warrant. For an additional $11.50 ($42.28 in total) you can have a total of four shares of stock (at the equivalent of $10.57 each). So, if the price of the bare stock rises above $10.57, then it could become sensible to exercise one warrant and sell four shares of stock (again allowing a margin for the cost of selling the stock). The trading price of the original unit (1 stock + 1/3 warrant) shouldn't (I believe) directly affect your decision to exercise warrants, although it would be a factor in deciding whether to resell the units you've already got. As you say, if they are now trading at $10.72, then having bought them at $10.26 you would make a profit if sold. Curiously, unless I'm missing something, or the figures you quote are incorrect, the current price of the \"\"unit\"\" (1 stock + 1/3 warrant; $10.72) seems overpriced compared to the price of the bare stock ($10.12). Reversing the above calculation, if bare stock is trading at $10.12, then four shares would cost $40.48. Deducting the $11.50 cost-of-exercising, this would value three \"\"combined units\"\" at $28.98, or $9.66 each, which is considerably below the market price you quote. One reason the \"\"unit\"\" (1 stock + 1/3 warrant) is trading at $10.72 instead of $9.66 could be that the market believes the price of the bare share (currently $10.12) will eventually move towards or above $11.50. If that happens, the option of exercising warrants at $11.50 becomes more and more attractive. The premium presumably reflects this potential future benefit. Finally, \"\"Surely I am misunderstand the stock IPO's intent.\"\": presumably, the main intent of Social Capital was to raise as much money as possible through this IPO to fund their future activities. The \"\"positive view\"\" is that they expect this future activity to be profitable, and therefore the price of ordinary stock to go up (at least as far as, ideally way beyond) the $11.50 exercise price, and the offering of warrants will be seen as a \"\"thank you\"\" to those investors who took the risk of taking part in the IPO. A completely cynical view would be that they don't really care what happens to the stock price, but that \"\"offering free stuff\"\" (or what looks like \"\"free stuff\"\") will simply attract more \"\"punters\"\" to the IPO. In reality, the truth is probably somewhere between those two extremes.\""

        "answer": "The Dow Divisor is calculated based on continuity in the index value despite changes such as stock splits. When a stock split occurs, the old prices and the old divisor are known, and the new prices can be obtained post-split. By maintaining the equivalency of the index value before and after the event, the new divisor can be computed. For example, if the Dow Divisor was 0.14602128057775 on December 24, 2015, then every $1 change in price of a stock within the index equates to a 6.848 point movement in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). To calculate a new divisor following an event like a stock split, you'd make sure the indexed value remains the same by solving for the new divisor in the equation where the sum of old prices divided by the old divisor equals the sum of new prices divided by the new divisor.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Have you actually read the Wikipedia article? To calculate the DJIA, the sum of the prices of all 30 stocks is divided by a divisor, the Dow Divisor. The divisor is adjusted in case of stock splits, spinoffs or similar structural changes, to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the DJIA. Early on, the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies; which made the DJIA at first, a simple arithmetic average. The present divisor, after many adjustments, is less than one (meaning the index is larger than the sum of the prices of the components). That is: DJIA = sum(p) / d where p are the prices of the component stocks and d is the Dow Divisor. Events such as stock splits or changes in the list of the companies composing the index alter the sum of the component prices. In these cases, in order to avoid discontinuity in the index, the Dow Divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide: DJIA = sum(p_old) / d_old = sum(p_new) / d_new The Dow Divisor was 0.14602128057775 on December 24, 2015.[40] Presently, every $1 change in price in a particular stock within the average, equates to a 6.848 (or 1 \u00f7 0.14602128057775) point movement. Knowing the old prices, new prices (e.g. following a split), and old divisor, you can easily compute the new divisor... Edit: Also, the detailed methodology is published by SP Indices (PDF). Edit #2: For simplicity's sake, assume the DJIA is an index that contains 4 stocks, with a price of $100.00 each. One of the stocks splits 2:1, meaning the new price/share is $50.00. Plugging the numbers into the above equation, we can determine the new Dow Divisor: 400 / 4 = 350 / d => d = 3.5",
            "The details of the DJIA methodology is outlined in the official methodology document on their website.  In addition, you will need their index mathematics document, which gives the nitty-gritty details of any type of adjustments that must be made.

        "question": "What do these numbers mean? (futures)",
        "answer": "The document you have uploaded contains information regarding futures contracts, which are financial instruments that can be based on tangible assets like agricultural products or intangible assets such as shares. A futures contract enables the seller to lock in a price to protect against price fluctuations between the contract's initiation date and the settlement date. The risk of price fluctuations is transferred to the buyer, who typically pays a discount from the spot price on the original day. For example, a farmer might enter into a futures contract with a textile manufacturer to deliver wool at a specified price in the future, thereby shifting the risk to the manufacturer.\n\nFutures contracts can also be based on securities such as stocks. If a party agrees to sell stocks at a certain price on a future date, they must complete the transaction on the strike date by either delivering the stocks they own, purchasing them beforehand, or acquiring them on the settlement day to fulfill the contract.\n\nRegarding S&P 500 futures, these contracts have specific specifications including initial margin and contract size. The contract size typically requires the delivery of 1,000 units of the underlying asset (e.g., the S&P 500 index level multiplied by 1,000), and the initial margin represents how much the trader would need to establish the contract.\n\nFurthermore, the document mentions that for an E-Mini S&P futures contract, the price quoted is not a dollar value but a point value, which acts as a multiplier for determining the dollar value of the contract. For instance, if the contract has a point value of $50, then the dollar value of a contract quoted at 1581.75 points would be 50 x 1581.75 = $79,087.50. This means that the trader would theoretically need $79,087 to buy the contract outright, but in practice futures are often traded on margin, requiring only a deposit amount.\n\nFor more details about futures exchanges and how they facilitate transactions through an order book with market and limit orders, specific examples in the document could be revisited for a more comprehensive insight .",

            "\"No, it means that is only the notional value of that underlying asset of that contract, generally. The contract specification itself is listed on the exchange's websites, and there are really no assumptions you can make about a particular contract. Where S&P futures have one set of specifications, such as what it actually represents, how many each contract holds, how to price profits and losses... a different contract, such as FTSE 100 stock futures have a completely different set of specifications. Anyway in this one example the s&p 500 futures contract has an \"\"initial margin\"\" of $19,250, meaning that is how much it would cost you to establish that contract. Futures generally require delivery of 1,000 units of the underlying asset. So you would take the underlying asset's price and multiple it by 1,000. (what price you use is also mentioned in the contract specification), The S&P 500 index  is $1588 you mentioned, so on Jun2013 you would have to delivery $1588 x 1000, or $1,588,000. GREAT NEWS, you only have to put up 1.2% in principal to control a 1.5 million dollar asset! Although, if even that amount is too great, you can look at the E-Mini S&P futures, which require about 1/10th the capital and delivery. This answer required that a lot of different subjects be mentioned, so feel free to ask a new question about the more specific topics.\"",
            "The other answer covers the mechanics of how to buy/sell a future contract. You seem however to be under the impression that you can buy the contract at 1,581.90 today and sell at 1,588.85 on expiry date if the index does not move. This is true but there are two important caveats: In other words, it is not the case that your chance of making money by buying that contract is more than 50%...",
            "The two answers given previously provide excellent information. In relation to your statement: If I buy the above future contract, does that mean I pay $1581.90 on June 13th You cannot buy the futures contract at that price. The 'price' you are seeing quoted is not a dollar value, but rather a value in points. Each contract has a point value, and this varies from one contract to another according to the specifications set out by the exchange. The point value is in dollars, and it therefore acts as a multiplier for the 'price' that you've seen quoted. Let's look at an example for the E-Mini S&P futures. These trade electronically on the Globex exchange, the ECN order book of the CME, and carry the ticker symbol ES.  The ES contract has a point value of $50. If the quoted price for the ES is 1581.75, then its dollar value is 50 x 1581.75 = $79,087.50 So in order to buy this contract outright, with absolutely no use of leverage, then one theoretically requires $79,087 in one's account. In practice though, futures are traded on margin and so only a deposit amount is required at the time of purchase, as CQM has explained."

        "question": "What type of returns Vanguard is quoting?",
        "answer": "The Vanguard returns that are quoted in the document seems to refer to both equity and bond returns. The document explains that historically, equity (stock market) investors have been rewarded with a premium over bond returns. Additionally, the document mentions that bond returns have historically lagged behind equity returns by about 5\u20136 percentage points on an annualized basis, leading to a significant return differential over longer time periods. Vanguard uses this historical perspective to justify their asset allocation strategies in their Target Retirement funds.\n\nFor a more detailed understanding, the document also refers to the Vanguard Capital Markets Model, which is used to evaluate and identify an appropriate glide path for investment strategies by running various financial simulations and examining different risk-reward scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, the document addresses stock and bond allocations adjustments based on market conditions and the impact this might have on long-term returns. It also touches on life strategy funds and the importance of maintaining a specific allocation that does not automatically adjust like the Target Retirement funds, which are based on a specific retirement date. The different fees associated with investment funds are also discussed, including transaction fees for buying ETFs. Lastly, there is a mention of the types of returns one could expect from investments in emerging markets.\n\nThis information can be found in the document excerpts discussing the construction of Vanguard's portfolios and the principles underlying their glide path construction .",

        "question": "Pay off mortgage or invest in high value saving account",
        "answer": "When deciding whether to pay off your mortgage or invest in a high-value savings account, there are a few factors to consider:\n\n1. Interest Rates: It is generally advisable to invest your money if the rate of return on your investments is higher than the interest rate on your mortgage. You need to compare the expected return of the investment versus the cost of the mortgage interest, which might be even lower if you can deduct the mortgage interest from your taxes .\n\n2. Investment Horizon: If you are considering paying off a mortgage early or investing, think about the time horizon. For example, if you're looking at a 15-year span, historical data shows that a diversified investment like an index tracking the S&P 500 could offer a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) that exceeds the interest rate of a low mortgage (around 3%). Keep in mind that investment returns are neither guaranteed nor predictable, and past performance does not assure future results .\n\n3. Risk Tolerance: Your personal risk tolerance is a significant factor. The safer route is typically to pay off debt, ensuring you have less financial obligation and a clear title to your property. Conversely, investing carries the potential for higher returns but also comes with the risk of loss .\n\n4. Loan Type: The type of mortgage you have can also influence the decision. Some mortgages penalize early repayments, and in such cases, it might be wiser to invest and then pay off the mortgage when you can do so without penalties. On the other hand, if extra repayments are to your advantage, it might be better to reduce your debt first .\n\n5. Tax Considerations: Mortgage interest deduction can be a factor in your decision. You need to calculate whether the tax benefit from mortgage interest deduction outweighs the benefits of investing that money. Keep in mind that only the interest portion offers a tax deduction, not the principal .\n\n6. Financial Security: Owning your home outright provides significant financial security and peace of mind as no creditor can claim it. This could be an essential factor for some individuals who value the security over potential higher returns from investments .\n\nIn summary, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, and the decision should be based on your specific financial situation, goals, and preferences. You should consider speaking with a financial adviser to assess your individual circumstances before making a decision.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Basically, the easiest way to do this is to chart out the \"\"what-ifs\"\". Applying the amortization formula (see here) using the numbers you supplied and a little guesswork, I calculated an interest rate of 3.75% (which is good) and that you've already made 17 semi-monthly payments (8 and a half months' worth) of $680.04, out of a 30-year, 720-payment loan term. These are the numbers I will use. Let's now suppose that tomorrow, you found $100 extra every two weeks in your budget, and decided to put it toward your mortgage starting with the next payment. That makes the semi-monthly payments $780 each. You would pay off the mortgage in 23 years (making 557 more payments instead of 703 more). Your total payments will be $434,460, down from $478.040, so your interest costs on the loan were reduced by $43,580 (but, my mistake, we can't count this amount as money in the bank; it's included in the next amount of money to come in). Now, after the mortgage is paid off, you have $780 semi-monthly for the remaining 73 months of your original 30-year loan (a total of $113,880) which you can now do something else with. If you stuffed it in your mattress, you'd earn 0% and so that's the worst-case scenario. For anything else to be worth it, you must be getting a rate of return such that $100 payments, 24 times a year for a total of 703 payments must equal $113,880. We use the future value annuity formula (here): v = p*((i+1)n-1)/i, plugging in v ($113880, our FV goal), $100 for P (the monthly payment) and 703 for n (total number of payments. We're looking for i, the interest rate. We're making 24 payments per year, so the value of i we find will be 1/24 of the stated annual interest rate of any account you put it into. We find that in order to make the same amount of money on an annuity that you save by paying off the loan, the interest rate on the account must average 3.07%. However, you're probably not going to stuff the savings from the mortgage in your mattress and sleep on it for 6 years. What if you invest it, in the same security you're considering now? That would be 146 payments of $780 into an interest-bearing account, plus the interest savings. Now, the interest rate on the security must be greater, because you're not only saving money on the mortgage, you're making money on the savings. Assuming the annuity APR stays the same now vs later, we find that the APR on the annuity must equal, surprise, 3.75% in order to end up with the same amount of money. Why is that? Well, the interest growing on your $100 semi-monthly exactly offsets the interest you would save on the mortgage by reducing the principal by $100. Both the loan balance you would remove and the annuity balance you increase would accrue the same interest over the same time if they had the same rate. The main difference, to you, is that by paying into the annuity now, you have cash now; by paying into the mortgage now, you don't have money now, but you have WAY more money later. The actual real time-values of the money, however, are the same; the future value of $200/mo for 30 years is equal to $0/mo for 24 years and then $1560/mo for 6 years, but the real money paid in over 30 years is $72,000 vs $112,320. That kind of math is why analysts encourage people to start retirement saving early. One more thing. If you live in the United States, the interest charges on your mortgage are tax-deductible. So, that $43,580 you saved by paying down the mortgage? Take 25% of it and throw it away as taxes (assuming you're in the most common wage-earner tax bracket). That's $10895 in potential tax savings that you don't get over the life of the loan. If you penalize the \"\"pay-off-early\"\" track by subtracting those extra taxes, you find that the break-even APR on the annuity account is about 3.095%.\""

        "question": "Since many brokers disallow investors from shorting sub-$5 stocks, why don't all companies split their stock until it is sub-$5",
        "answer": "Companies that aren't already penny stocks generally don't have anything to gain from trying to prevent short interest by making their stocks price fall below $5. Short selling does not inherently lower the stock price any more so than any other kind of selling because it usually involves borrowing a stock from another investor's margin. This kind of trading can sometimes drive the price up in the long term due to short squeezes if a rally occurs. Moreover, many investors view a high short interest as a bullish signal, not a bearish one.\n\nIn addition, companies avoid deliberately lowering their stock prices because a split does not affect the capital they can raise\u2014it does not change the actual market cap of the company. For example, whether a company issues 1 million shares at $50.00 each or 10 million shares at $5.00 each to raise capital, it still results in the same amount of $50 million being raised and causes a 5% dilution, which the market will react to accordingly.\n\nFurthermore, there are practical considerations, such as listing requirements. Prices too close to penny stock territory risk being delisted according to typical exchange criteria. Stock price volatility is another concern, as at lower stock prices, relatively small changes can represent huge percentage fluctuations, which is not desirable for companies. These factors contribute to why companies don't split their stocks to make them fall below $5 to avoid shorting. Lastly, many fraudsters operate in the area of penny stocks, and no reputable company wants to be associated with that sphere of the market .",

            "\"Vitalik has mentioned this in a comment but I think it ought to be expanded upon: Companies that aren't already penny stocks really don't stand to gain anything from trying to prevent short interest.  Short selling does not inherently lower the stock price - not any more so than any other kind of selling.  When somebody shorts a stock, it's simply borrowed from another investor's margin; as long as it's not a naked short resulting in an FTD (Failure To Deliver) then it does not add any \"\"artificial\"\" selling pressure. In fact, shorting can actually drive the price up in the long term due to stops and margin calls.  Not a guarantee, of course, but if a rally occurs then a high short interest can cause a cascade effect from the short \"\"squeeze\"\", resulting in an even bigger rally than what would have occurred with zero short interest.  Many investors actually treat a high short interest as a bullish signal. Compare with margin buying - essentially the opposite of short selling - which has the opposite effect.  If investors buy stocks on margin, then if the value of that stock decreases too rapidly they will be forced to sell, which can cause the exact same cascade effect as a short interest but in the opposite direction.  Shorting is (in a sense) evening out the odds by inflating the buying pressure at lower stock prices when the borrowers decide to cover and take profits. Bottom line is that, aside from (illegal) insider trading, it doesn't do businesses any good to try to manipulate their stock price or any trading activity.  Yes, a company can raise capital by selling additional common shares, but a split really has no effect on the amount of capital they'd be able to raise because it doesn't change the actual market cap, and a dilution is a dilution regardless of the current stock price.  If a company's market cap is $1 billion then it doesn't matter if they issue 1 million shares at $50.00 each or 10 million shares at $5.00 each; either way it nets them $50 million from the sale and causes a 5% dilution, to which the market will react accordingly. They don't do it because there'd be no point.\"",

The exchanges want to promote price appreciation.  Otherwise, everything trades in a tight band and there is little point to the whole endeavor.  Volatility is another issue that they are concerned about.  At such low stock prices, small changes in stock prices are huge percentage changes.

        "question": "IS it the wrong time to get into the equity market immediately after large gains?",
        "answer": "According to the information from the file provided, investing right after the market has experienced large gains can be a complex decision. It's not necessarily the wrong time if you're looking to invest for the long term. While it's true that equities tend to fluctuate, with a long enough time horizon, they almost always outperform cash and bonds. Historical data suggests that no matter if the market was at a high or a low on the day you invest, after 10-20 years the probability of being in profit is almost certainly 1.0. Additionally, equities compound dividends and investing in diversified stock indices such as the S&P 500, FTSE 100, DOW 30, or indices/funds that pay dividends through dollar-cost averaging can help capture returns over time .\n\nDollar-cost averaging, where you invest a lump sum and then add a set amount every month, is recommended as a strategy to mitigate risk and take advantage of market fluctuations over time. The idea is to diversify and not to try to time the market perfectly, which is nearly impossible even for professional investors. By diversifying (which includes having large cap stocks as part of your portfolio), you have a safer portfolio as different asset classes take turns outperforming each other. A simple and diversified portfolio could consist of something like 60% in equity and 40% in bonds, and you could also consider international exposure and real estate via a REIT fund .\n\nIt's essential to remember that risk appetite, financial goals, and time horizon are critical factors when making investment decisions. Hence, coming back to your question, while it's not necessarily the wrong time to get into the equity market immediately after large gains, it is crucial to have a well-diversified portfolio and a long-term investment strategy to manage risk and work toward financial goals effectively.",

This becomes problematic because of changes in the definition of earnings and the recent inflation stability which has encouraged high valuations:  Cash flow has not been as corrupted as earnings now, and might be a better indicator:  This obviously isn't perfect either, but returns can be improved. Since there is no formulaic way yet conventionally available, the optimal primary strategy is still buy & hold which has made the most successful investor frequently one of the richest people on the planet for decades, but this could still be used as an auxiliary for cash management reserves during recessions once retired.",
            "\"Past results are not a predictor of future results. There is no explicit upper bound on a market, and even if individual companies' values were remaining unchanged one would expect the market to drift upward in the long term.

Trying to time the market -- to guess when it's going to move in any particular direction -- is usually closer to gambling than investing. The simplest answer remains a combination of buy-and-hold and dollar-cost averaging. Buy at a constant number of dollars per month (or whatever frequency you prefer), and you will automatically buy more when the stock/fund is lower, less when it is higher. That takes advantage of downturns as buying opportunities without missing out on possible gains at the other end. Personally, I add a bit of contrarian buying to that -- I increased my buying another notch or two while the market was depressed, since I had money I wouldn't need any time soon (buy and hold) and I was reasonably confident that enough of the market would come back strongly enough that I wasn't at significant risk of losing the investment. That's one of the things which causes me to be categorized as an \"\"aggressive investor\"\" even though I'm operating with a very vanilla mix of mutual funds and not attempting to micromanage my money.

However, it's important to note that different indices have different weightings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, is a price-weighted index, not market-cap weighted.\n\nAs for ETFs, which often aim to replicate the performance of a particular index, a rebalancing would occur to reflect the change in weighting of the company within the index due to the issuance of new shares. If the ETF follows a market-capitalization-weighted index, the ETF would purchase additional shares of the company to match the new market capitalization weight of the company within the index. If the ETF tracks a price-weighted index like the DJIA, the impact would depend on how the additional shares affect the stock price and, subsequently, the price weighting of the stock within the index. \n\nTherefore, the impact on an ETF when an underlying company issues more shares can vary depending on the type of index the ETF is tracking and how the index weights its components.",

At least this is what should happen, since an   index is basically a sum of the market cap of the contributing   companies. No, indices can have various weightings. The DJIA is a price-weighted index not market-cap weighted. An alternative weighting besides market-cap and price is equal weighting. From Dow Jones: Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2122. Introduced in May 1896, the index, also   referred to as The Dow\u00ae, is a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S.   blue-chip companies. Thus, I can wonder what in the new shares makes the index go up? If a stock is split, the Dow divisor is adjusted as one could easily see how the current Dow value isn't equal to the sum or the share prices of the members of the index. In other cases, there may be a dilution of earnings but that doesn't necessarily affect the stock price directly as there may be options exercised or secondary offerings made. SO if the index, goes up, will the ETF DIA also go up automatically   although no additional buying has happened in the ETF itself? If the index rises and the ETF doesn't proportionally, then there is an arbitrage opportunity for someone to buy the DIA shares that can be redeemed for the underlying stocks that are worth more in this case.

        "question": "What is market order's relation to bid ask spread?",
        "answer": "A market order is an order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current price. It does not specify a price and is executed at the best price available at the moment of the transaction. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a security (bid) and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept (ask). The relationship between a market order and the bid-ask spread is crucial because when an investor places a market order to buy a stock, the order will be filled at the current ask price, and when they place a market order to sell, the order will be filled at the current bid price.\n\nThis means that the investor accepts the current bid-ask spread and will buy at the higher ask price or sell at the lower bid price. For example, if someone places a market order to buy a stock, and the current quote is \"bid 15, ask 15.25,\" the market order will execute at $15.25 per share, which is the ask price. Similarly, if they place a market order to sell the stock, the transaction will occur at the bid price of $15 per share. Market makers, who provide liquidity in the market by being willing to buy and sell securities, profit from this spread by buying at the bid price and selling at the ask price .\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that while ordinary investors typically buy at the ask and sell at the bid, market makers operate on the opposite side\u2014they buy at the bid and sell at the ask, thus profiting from the spread . However, this does not mean that ordinary investors cannot submit limit orders or engage in similar trading strategies as market makers; it simply refers to the most common interactions of buyers and sellers with market orders in relation to the bid-ask spread.",

If placing a limit buy order at the top of 91 (for 90/98) you would not get filled but just be placed at the top of the list. You might get filled at a lower price if an ask comes in matching your bid, however you might never get filled. In regards to market orders, with the 100/101 being more liquid, if your market order is larger than the orders at 101, then the remainder of your order should still get filled at only a slightly higher price. In regards to market orders with the 90/98, being less liquid, it is likely that only part of your order gets filled, and any remained either doesn't get filled or gets filled at a much higher price."

        "question": "Pros/cons of borrowing money using a mortgage loan and investing it in a low-fee index fund?",
        "answer": "Borrowing money through a mortgage loan to invest in a low-fee index fund comes with several pros and cons:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. **Potential for Higher Returns**: Investing in the stock market, particularly in a diversified low-fee index fund, can offer the potential for higher returns than the interest rate on a mortgage loan, especially if market conditions are favorable.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. **Increased Risk**: Leverage amplifies risk considerably. If you invest your own money, you risk losing what you started with, but if you borrow to invest, you might lose much more than you started with .\n2. **Currency Risk**: If you're borrowing in one currency (e.g., Canadian dollars) but investing in a fund that holds assets in another currency (e.g., U.S. dollars), you face currency risk. A strengthening of your borrowing currency against the fund's currency can lead to financial loss, regardless of the fund's positive returns .\n3. **Dividend Variability**: Dividends paid by the underlying stocks in a fund are not guaranteed and can vary, potentially affecting the income required to cover mortgage interest payments .\n4. **Market Conditions**: A fall in the housing market or poor stock market performance, as seen during the UK endowment mortgage crisis, could leave investors with a fund value less than their mortgage and possibly in negative equity .\n5. **Interest Rates vs. Investment Returns**: There's a risk that the after-tax returns from the fund might not exceed the mortgage interest rate, leading to a net loss instead of gain .\n6. **Emergency Fund Considerations**: Without a significant emergency fund, there's a risk if sudden financial needs arise and investments are tied up, potentially leading to financial strain .\n7. **Locked-In Funds**: Additional mortgage payments toward principal lock in funds that cannot be easily accessed without taking out another loan, like a HELOC, which would have additional costs .\n\nUltimately, the decision to leverage a mortgage for investment in an index fund requires careful consideration of your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions. It's important to fully understand the risks and to manage them properly, including being able to still cover the loan if the investment does not perform as expected  .",

            "Risk is the problem, as others have pointed out. Your fixed mortgage interest rate is for a set period of time only. Let's say your 3% might be good for five years, because that's typical of fixed-rate mortages in Canada. So, what happens in five years if your investment has dropped 50% due to a prolonged bear market, and interest rates have since moved up from 3% to 8%? Your investment would be underwater, and you wouldn't have enough to pay off the loan and exit the failed strategy. Rather, you might just be stuck with renewing the mortage at a rate that makes the strategy far less attractive, being more likely to lose money in the long run than to earn any. Leverage, or borrowing to invest, amplifies your risk considerably. If you invest your own money in the market, you might lose what you started with, but if you borrow to invest, you might lose much more than you started with. There's also one very specific issue with the example investment you've proposed: You would be borrowing Canadian dollars but investing in an index fund of U.S.-based companies that trade in U.S. dollars. Even if the index has positive returns in U.S. dollar terms, you might end up losing money if the Canadian dollar strengthens vs. the U.S. dollar. It has happened before, multiple times. So, while this strategy has worked wonderfully in the past, it has also failed disastrously in the past. Unless you have a crystal ball, you need to be aware of the various risks and weigh them vs. the potential rewards. There is no free lunch.",
            "Well for a start funds don't pay interest.  If you pick an income-paying fund (as opposed to one that automatically reinvests any income for you) you will receive periodic income based on the dividends paid by the underlying stocks, but it won't be the steady predictable interest payment you might get from a savings account or fixed-rate security. This income is not guaranteed and will vary based on the performance of the companies making up the fund. It's also quite likely that the income by itself won't cover the interest on your mortgage.  The gains from stock market investment come from a mixture of dividends and capital growth (i.e. the increase in the price of the shares).  So you may have to sell units now and again or cover part of the interest payments from other income. You're basically betting that the after-tax returns from the fund will be greater than the mortgage interest rate you're paying.   3 facts: If you're comfortable with these 3 facts, go for it. If they're going to keep you awake at night, you might not want to take the risk.",
            "Risk.  That's it.  No guarantees on the fund performance, while the mortgage has a guaranteed return of -3%.  I'm doing this very thing.  Money is cheap, I think it's wise to take advantage of it, assuming your exercise proper risk management.",
            "Something very similar to this was extremely popular in the UK in the late 1980s.  The practice has completely vanished since the early 2000s.  Reading up on the UK endowment mortgage scandals will probably give you an excellent insight into whether you should attempt your plan. Endowment mortgages were provided by banks and at their peak were probably the most popular mortgage form.  The basic idea was that you only pay the interest on your mortgage and invest a small amount each month into a low fee endowment policy.  Many endowment policies were simply index tracking, and the idea being that by the end of your mortgage you would have built up a portfolio sufficient to pay off your mortgage, and may well have extra left over. In the late 1990s the combination of falling housing market and poor stock performance meant that many people were left with both the endowment less than their mortgage and their house in negative equity.",
            "Essentially, what you're describing is a leveraged investment.  As others noted, the question is how confident you can be that (a) the returns on the investment will exceed what you're paying in interest, and (b) that if you lose the bet you'll still be able to pay off the loan without severely injuring yourself.  I did essentially this when I bought my house, taking out a larger loan than necessary and leaving more money in my investments, which had been returning more than the mortgage's interest rate. I then got indecently lucky during the recession and was able to refinance down to under 4%, which I am very certain my investment will beat. I actually considered lengthening the term of the loan for that reason, or borrowing a bit more, but decided not to double down on the bet; that was my own risk-comfort threshold. Know exactly what your risks are, including secondary effects of these risks. Run the numbers to see what the likely return is. Decide whether you like the odds enough to go for it."

The primary market is where securities are created (through an initial public offering, or IPO), while the secondary market is where already-issued securities are traded among investors. The main function of the secondary market is to provide a platform for buying and selling securities by investors. It ensures liquidity and allows investors to enter and exit investments easily.

        "question": "Why sometimes payable date is BEFORE the ex-dividend date?",
        "answer": "The standard procedure for dividend payments is that the ex-dividend date is usually set for stocks two business days before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend.\n\nThe scenario where a payable date is before the ex-dividend date is not typical and might be due to unique circumstances specific to the company or the market. It could potentially be a data error or a special situation where the company adjusted its payout schedule for a particular reason. Normally, shareholders entitled to receive dividends are determined on the record date, which is after the ex-dividend date. If you have a specific instance in mind where the payable date is before the ex-dividend date, it could be worth investigating the details released by the company to understand their rationale or to see if there was an administrative adjustment.",

        "answer": "The document you have provided, titled \"fiqa_doc.txt,\" appears to contain information on various financial and business-related topics such as check reissuing, money orders, LLCs, business credit, and accounting practices. However, without more specific questions, it's difficult to provide targeted assistance on setting up an investment portfolio for a beginner.\n\nIf you are looking for general advice on creating an investment portfolio, here are some fundamental steps and considerations for beginners:\n\n1. **Determine your financial goals**: Are you saving for retirement, a house, education, or to generate wealth? Your goals will dictate your investment strategy.\n\n2. **Assess your risk tolerance**: Are you willing to take high risks for a potentially high return, or do you prefer a cautious approach with lower but more stable returns? Younger investors often have a higher risk tolerance because they have time to recover from market downturns.\n\n3. **Educate yourself about investment options**: Familiarize yourself with different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, real estate, etc.), their risks and potential returns, as well as how they fit into an investment strategy.\n\n4. **Diversify your portfolio**: Don't put all your money in one investment. Spread your investments across different assets to reduce risk.\n\n5. **Decide on an investment strategy**: You can be active, picking individual stocks or assets, or you can be passive, using index funds that track market benchmarks.\n\n6. **Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio**: As your financial goals and market conditions change, so should your portfolio.\n\n7. **Consider retirement accounts**: In the US, tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s can be beneficial for long-term saving.\n\n8. **Keep costs low**: Pay attention to fees associated with your investments and try to minimize them where possible.\n\n9. **Set realistic expectations**: Understand that investments can go down as well as up, and that patience is often rewarded in investing.\n\n10. **Seek professional advice**: If you're new to investing, consider consulting with a financial advisor to help craft a plan that's right for you.\n\nIf you have specific topics in the document you uploaded that you want to discuss, or if you have more targeted questions, please provide details so I can assist you further.",

            "\"Some thoughts: 1) Do you have a significant emergency fund (3-6 months of after-tax living expenses)? If not, you stand to take a significant loss if you have an unexpected need for cash that is tied up in investments. What if you lose/hate your job or your car breaks down? What if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live? Having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk. 2) Lagerbaer has a good suggestion. Given that if you'd reinvested your dividends, the S&P 500 has returned about 3.5% over the last 5 years, you may be able to get a very nice risk-free return.  3) Do you have access to employer matching funds, such as in a 401(k) at work? If you get a dollar-for-dollar match, that is a risk-free pre-tax 100% return and should be a high priority. 4) What do you mean by \"\"medium\"\" volatility? Given that you are considering a 2/3 equity allocation, it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15% or more in any given year and take several years to recover. If that would spook you, you may want to consider lowering your equity weights. A high quality bond fund may be a good fit. 5) Personally, I would avoid putting money into stocks that I didn't need back for 10 years. If you only want to tie your money up for 2-5 years, you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall, you won't have time to recover before you need your money back. The portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a long-term investment horizon and significant risk tolerance, which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement. However, if your goals are to invest for 2-5 years only, your situation would be significantly different.  6) You can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence, but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees, unless you plan to liquidate assets. If you plan to buy a house, saving enough to avoid PMI is a good risk-free return on your money. 7) In general, and ETF or index fund is a good idea, the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term. There are many good choices a la Vanguard here to choose from. 8) Don't worry about \"\"Buy low, sell high\"\". Don't be a speculator, be an investor (that's my version of Anthony Bourdain's, \"\"don't be a tourist, be a traveler\"\"). A speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at. An investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a part-owner. If you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions, good for you - you can move to Wall Street and make millions. However, almost no one can do this consistently, and it doesn't seem worth it to me to try. I don't mean to discourage you from investing, just make sure you have your bases covered so that you don't have to cash out at a bad time. Best of luck! Edit Response to additional questions below. 1) Emergency fund. I would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents (money market, short-term CDs, etc.) until you've built up an emergency fund. It makes sense to want to make the \"\"best\"\" use of your money, but you also have to account for risk. My concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events, that you could lose a lot of money, or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt, and it would be prudent to self-insure against some of those risks. I would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account. Taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissions/taxes/fees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns. Ideally, you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns. There are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds. Just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month, you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility, even if they are less common. Using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this. 2) Invest at all? I would recommend starting an emergency fund, and then beginning to invest for retirement. Once your retirement savings are on track, you can begin saving for whatever other goals you may have\""

        "question": "understanding the process/payment of short sale dividends",
        "answer": "The process of paying short sale dividends is connected to the mechanics of short selling itself. When a trader engages in a short sale, they are effectively selling shares they do not own. This involves borrowing the shares from a lender before selling them. It is a cash transaction where shares are delivered to the buyer, who then gains all the rights of share ownership, including the right to any dividends payable.\n\nIf the short seller has not borrowed the shares, the buyer would not receive the ownership rights, including dividends, which is why borrowing is a critical element of short selling. When a dividend is paid on the stock being shorted, the short seller is responsible for paying the equivalent dividend to the person or institution from whom they borrowed the shares. Because the buyer expects to receive all the benefits of owning the shares, including dividends, the short seller must ensure that the lender is made whole for any dividends distributed during the period the short sale is open.\n\nNotably, the borrowing of shares in a short sale is an off-market agreement between the lender and the borrower (short seller). The short seller does not pay the lender for the shares directly; instead, they pay financing costs for as long as they maintain the short position.",

Moreover, 401(k)s lower your taxable income which can be advantageous, especially if the company matches any contribution .\n\n2. Investing in a Roth IRA/401K is recommended if you are currently in a lower tax bracket, as it allows you to pay taxes now and enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It's important to start investing early due to the compounding effect and to take advantage of employer matching if available .\n\n3. A rule of thumb is mentioned: Invest in a tax-deferred account only if your marginal tax rate is higher now than it will be in retirement .\n\n4. When preparing for tax time, one should consider liquidity and the preservation of principal, with options such as CDs or high-interest savings accounts .\n\n5. Investing in equity is advisable for long term growth, and the strategy of dollar-cost averaging is recommended for both non-professionals and those who are risk-averse .\n\n6.

        "question": "Can you explain why it's better to invest now rather than waiting for the market to dip?",
        "answer": "Investing now rather than waiting for the market to dip is generally considered a better strategy for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Timing the Market is Challenging**: It is nearly impossible to correctly time the market by predicting the lowest point of a dip. Attempting to do so could result in missing the opportunity to buy at a lower cost, as your chance of correctly identifying the actual bottom is extremely low .\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: While waiting for a market dip, you incur an opportunity cost because your money is not invested and therefore not earning potential returns. This time out of the market can sometimes cost more than the potential savings from buying at a lower price .\n\n3. **Long-term Horizon Benefits**: Over a long enough time horizon, equities almost always outperform cash and bonds. Regardless of whether the market is at a high or low point at the time of investment, after a period of 10-20 years, the probability of being in profit increases significantly .\n\n4. **Compounding Dividends**: Equities can offer compounding dividends, and investing in diversified stock indices or dividend-paying funds can be a beneficial strategy. Reinvesting dividends can contribute to investment growth over time .\n\n5. **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**: Consistently investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market fluctuations, averages the cost of investments over time, and can reduce the impact of volatility. It is a strategy preferred by many non-professional and risk-averse investors .\n\n6. **Historical Performance**: Historical data suggests that investing in equities consistently over time, even through market highs and lows, has been a successful strategy for wealth accumulation. For example, if you had bought the S&P 500 in 2007 before the financial crisis and held onto it until 2014, you would have still seen a gain, excluding dividends, which beats returns from cash or bonds over that period .\n\n7. **Stay Invested**: It\u2019s generally recommended to start investing as early as possible and stay invested to benefit from long-term market growth. Markets will fluctuate, but maintaining investments over time can lead to substantial growth .\n\n8. **Mutual Funds and Diversification**: If you prefer a hands-off investment approach, mutual funds can be a good option. They allow investors to diversify their portfolios across various sectors and asset classes, which is key to managing risk over time .\n\nUltimately, while no investment strategy is without risk, these points illustrate why many financial advisors and experts discourage trying to time the market and instead advocate for a consistent, long-term investment approach.",

Equities compound dividends too, and the best place to invest is in diversified stock indices such as the S&P500, FTSE100, DOW30 or indices/funds which pay dividends. The best way to capture returns is to dollar cost average (e.g. place a lump sum, then add $x every month), to re-invest dividends, and oh, to forget about it in an IRA or SIPP (Self invested pension) or other vehicle which discourages tampering with your investment.  Yes, values rise and fall but we humans are so short sighted, if we had bought the S&P in 2007 and sold in 2009 in fear, we would have missed out on the 25% gain (excluding dividends) from 2007-2014.

        "question": "Why are US target retirement funds weighted so heavily towards US stocks?",
        "answer": "US target retirement funds are often weighted heavily towards US stocks for several reasons:\n\n1. Historical Stability: Traditionally, the United States has been viewed as a country with a stable economy. Investors like Benjamin Graham, who influenced Warren Buffett, have maintained a bias that the U.S.A. is more stable, while other countries are considered riskier. This view has been reflected in financial products, including target retirement funds .\n\n2. Reserve Currency: The US Dollar holds the status of the world reserve currency, albeit its influence is declining. This status also contributes to a preference for investment in US-based assets .\n\n3. Familiarity Bias: Fund managers, especially those based in the US, may have a bias toward investing in what they know best, which often means US companies and markets. Consequently, their comfort level with domestic investments leads to a home-country bias in the construction of the funds .\n\n4. Equity Risk Premium: Vanguard, in constructing its target date retirement funds, factors in the expectation of an equity risk premium, which acknowledges the historical pattern where stock market investors in the US and other countries have been rewarded with higher returns compared to bonds. Younger investors are seen as being better able to withstand risk, and stocks are heavily weighted in funds designed for them to balance the risk exposure to their work-related earnings .\n\nWhile these reasons provide some context for the heavy weighting towards US stocks, it is also worth noting that there is no requirement that target date funds have a global market index composition and historical ratios of domestic to foreign stock allocations have varied widely over time .",

This is not true anymore, and it's difficult for my generation to understand because we grew up in the U.S.A being challenged (and tend to think that China and India have always been powers), but when we read investors, like Benjamin Graham (who had significant influence with Warren Buffett), we can see this bias - the U.S.A to them is stable, and other countries are \"\"risky.\"\"  Again, with the national debt and the political game in our current time, it does not feel this way.  But that bias is often reflect in financial instruments. The US Dollar is still the reserve currency, though it's influence is declining and I would expect it to decline.  Contrary to my view (because I could be wrong here) is Mish, who argues that no one wants to have the reserve currency because having a reserve currency brings disadvantages (see here: Bogus Threats to US Reserve Currency Status: No Country Really Wants It!; I present this to show that my view could be wrong). Finally, there tends to be the \"\"go with what you know.\"\"  Many of these funds are managed by U.S. citizens, so they tend to have a U.S. bias and feel more comfortable investing their money \"\"at home\"\" (in fact a famous mutual fund manager, Peter Lynch, had a similar mentality - buy the company behind the stock and what company do we tend to know best?  The ones around us.). One final note, I'm not saying this mentality is correct, just what the attitude is like.  I think you may find that younger mutual fund managers tend to include more foreign stocks, as they've seen that different world.\"",

            "\"Exactly what accounts are affected by any given transaction is not a fixed thing. Just for example, in a simple accounting system you might have one account for \"\"stock on hand\"\". In a more complex system you might have this broken out into many accounts for different types of stock, stock in different locations, etc. So I can only suggest example specific accounts. But account type -- asset, liability, capital (or \"\"equity\"\"), income, expense -- should be universal. Debit and credit rules should be universal. 1: Sold product on account: You say it cost you $500 to produce. You don't say the selling price, but let's say it's, oh, $700. Credit (decrease) Asset \"\"Stock on hand\"\" by $500. Debit (increase) Asset \"\"Accounts receivable\"\" by $700. Credit (increase) Income \"\"Sales\"\" by $700. Debit (increase) Expense \"\"Cost of goods sold\"\" by $500. 2: $1000 spent on wedding party by friend I'm not sure how your friend's expenses affect your accounts. Are you asking how he would record this expense? Did you pay it for him? Are you expecting him to pay you back? Did he pay with cash, check, a credit card, bought on credit? I just don't know what's happening here. But just for example, if you're asking how your friend would record this in his own records, and if he paid by check: Credit (decrease) Asset \"\"checking account\"\" by $1000. Debit (increase) Expense \"\"wedding expenses\"\" by $1000. If he paid with a credit card: Credit (increase) Liability \"\"credit card\"\" by $1000. Debit (increase) Expense \"\"wedding expenses\"\" by $1000. When he pays off the credit card: Debit (decrease) Liability \"\"credit card\"\" by $1000. Credit (decrease) Asset \"\"cash\"\" by $1000. (Or more realistically, there are other expenses on the credit card and the amount would be higher.) 3: Issue $3000 in stock to partner company I'm a little shakier on this, I haven't worked with the stock side of accounting. But here's my best stab: Well, did you get anything in return? Like did they pay you for the stock? I wouldn't think you would just give someone stock as a present. If they paid you cash for the stock: Debit (increase) Asset \"\"cash\"\". Credit (decrease) Capital \"\"shareholder equity\"\". Anyone else want to chime in on that one, I'm a little shaky there. Here, let me give you the general rules. My boss years ago described it to me this way: You only need to know three things to understand double-entry accounting: 1: There are five types of accounts: Assets: anything you have that has value, like cash, buildings, equipment, and merchandise. Includes things you may not actually have in your hands but that are rightly yours, like money people owe you but haven't yet paid. Liabilities: Anything you owe to someone else. Debts, merchandise paid for but not yet delivered, and taxes due. Capital (some call it \"\"capital\"\", others call it \"\"equity\"\"): The difference between Assets and Liabilities. The owners investment in the company, retained earnings, etc. Income: Money coming in, the biggest being sales. Expenses: Money going out, like salaries to employees, cost of purchasing merchandise for resale, rent, electric bill, taxes, etc. Okay, that's a big \"\"one thing\"\". 2: Every transaction must update two or more accounts. Each update is either a \"\"debit\"\" or a \"\"credit\"\". The total of the debits must equal the total of the credits. 3: A dollar bill in your pocket is a debit. With a little thought (okay, sometimes a lot of thought) you can figure out everything else from there.\""

        "question": "Converting annual interbank rates into monthly rates",
        "answer": "The document provided talks about various types of interest rates, with specific mention of the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) in the U.S. and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in the U.K. These rates are described as the interest rates at which banks in their respective countries lend money to each other.\n\nHowever, it seems that the document does not directly address the method for converting annual interbank rates, such as LIBOR or FFR, into monthly rates. To convert an annual rate to a monthly rate, you would typically divide the annual rate by 12. This is based on the assumption that the annual rate is expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR) that follows simple interest and does not account for compounding within the year. If the rate is compounded annually, then you would need to take the 12th root (to account for monthly compounding) of the compounded annual rate and subtract 1 to get the monthly rate.\n\nFor example, if you have an annual rate (APR) of 12%, the monthly rate would be 12% / 12 months = 1% per month. If it's compounded, then for an annual rate (compounded) of 12%, the monthly compounded rate would be (1 + 0.12)^(1/12) - 1, which would give you a rate slightly higher than 1% per month due to compounding effects.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that different financial instruments might apply compounding differently (e.g., continuously, daily, monthly, quarterly, annually), which will affect how the conversion should be made.\n\nSince the conversion method is not provided in the document, the summary above is based on general financial principles. If you are looking for a specific method particular to a region or financial product, additional information or clarification from the document or other resources would be necessary.",

        "question": "Best way to pay off debt?",
        "answer": "The best way to pay off debt is subjective and can depend on numerous factors, but generally, it involves multiple strategies focused on reducing interest costs and managing your cash flow to pay down the debt as quickly as possible. Here are a few strategies that can be found in the document you've provided:\n\n1. **Pay off high-interest debt first**: This usually means paying off credit cards or any high-interest unsecured loans because they tend to have the highest interest rates  .\n\n2. **Avoid converting unsecured debt into secured debt**: This often does not solve the underlying spending problem and can put assets at risk  .\n\n3. **Negotiate with creditors**: Creditors may be willing to negotiate or relax terms on unsecured debt if they recognize the risk they face  .\n\n4. **Increase income and reduce expenses**: This basic strategy can help you generate free cash flow which can be used to repay debts more quickly  .\n\n5. **Sell non-essential assets**: If you have assets that are not generating a return, it may make sense to sell them to pay off debts that are accruing high-interest costs  .\n\n6. **Consider debt consolidation**: This can help in managing multiple debts with a single payment and potentially at a lower interest rate, just be cautious to not continue the spending habits that led to the accumulation of debt originally  .\n\n7. **Maintain a good credit utilization ratio**: Keeping your credit utilization ratio low is good for your credit score. However, having a zero balance on your cards can be a negative hit. It's better to have small, manageable amounts that you pay off in full each month  .\n\n8. **Tax considerations**: Some debts like student loans in the United States may offer tax deductions on the interest paid, which could affect the strategy for which debts to pay off first  .\n\n9. **401(k) contributions**: If your employer offers a generous match on 401(k) contributions, it may be better to take advantage of this rather than paying off a low-interest debt since the match offers an immediate return that may outweigh the cost of the debt interest  .\n\nIt is crucial to carefully consider your financial situation, interest rates on debts, and any potential benefits such as tax deductions or employer matches on retirement contributions before deciding on the best strategy for paying off debt. Always make sure to run the numbers and decide based on the specifics of your financial scenario.",

        "answer": "Yes, trades can indeed happen in between the bid and ask price. There are several situations which can lead to such trades:\n\n1. Hidden limit orders posted on a public exchange with bid prices above the best visible bid or offers below the best visible offer, which are executed against incoming orders.\n2.

Saying the trade can happen \"\"in between\"\" the bid & ask is simplistic.  There is a time dimension to the market.  It's more accurate to say that an order can be placed \"\"in between\"\" the current best bid & ask (observed at time T=0), thus establishing a new level for one or the other of those quoted prices (observed at time T>0). If you enter a market order to buy (or sell), then yes, you'll generally be accepting the current best ask (or best bid) with your order, because that's what a market order says to do: Accept the current best market price being offered for your kind of transaction.  Of course, prices may move much faster than your observation of the price and the time it takes to process your order \u2013 you're far from being the only participant. Market orders aside, you are free to name your own price above or below the current best bid & ask, respectively. ... then one could say that you are placing an order \"\"in between\"\" the bid and ask at the time your order is placed.  However \u2013 and this is key \u2013 you are also moving one or the other of those quoted prices in the process of placing your above-bid buy order or your below-ask sell order. Then, only if somebody else in the market chooses to accept your new ask (or bid) does your intended transaction take place. And that transaction takes place at the new ask (or bid) price, not the old one that was current when you entered your order. Read more about bid & ask prices at this other question: (p.s. FWIW, I don't necessarily agree with the assertion from the article you quoted, i.e.: \"\"By looking for trades that take place in between the bid and ask, you can tell when a strong trend is about to come to an end.\"\"  I would say: Maybe, perhaps, but maybe not.)\"",
            "All the time. For high volume stocks, it may be tough to see exactly what's going on, e.g. the bid/ask may be moving faster than your connection to the broker can show you.  What I've observed is with options. The volume on some options is measured in the 10's or 100's of contracts in a day. I'll see a case where it's $1.80/$2.00 bid/ask, and by offering $1.90 will often see a fill at that price. Since I may be the only trade on that option in the 15 minute period and note that the stock wasn't moving more than a penny during that time, I know that it was my order that managed to fill between the bid/ask.",

        "question": "Choosing the limit when making a limit order?",
        "answer": "When making a limit order, you have to determine the specific price you are willing to pay for a stock (if you're buying) or the price you are willing to sell it for (if you're selling). Choosing the limit price should be part of your investing strategy and can be based on your analysis of the stock's value, how it fits within your portfolio, and your willingness to buy or sell at a certain price point to take advantage of market volatility.\n\nIdeally, you would have done your due diligence to decide at what price you consider the stock a good buy or sell. For instance, you might evaluate the stock's historical performance, financials, market conditions, and your own investment goals to set a limit price.\n\nThere are different strategies you can use to decide on the limit price:\n\n- You can do analysis and pick a price that you think is fair for the stock, then place a limit order at that price.\n- You could also consider using stop orders, which allow you to set a trigger price that, when passed, places a limit order at your pre-determined price.\n- It may be wise to avoid emotional decision-making and not chase the market, so setting your prices based on thorough analysis when the market is closed is often suggested.\n\nRemember that the market moves based on supply and demand, and placing a limit order does not guarantee execution; the market needs a corresponding seller or buyer at your specified price. If making a buy limit order, your order will execute only if a seller\u2019s ask price meets your limit buy price, whereas with a sell limit order, it will execute only when a buyer's bid meets your limit sell price .",

But as an investor you should stick to your guns and say I wouldn't buy any higher than this or sell any lower than this. As you are going long, buying at the right price is essential. You aren't going to run away tomorrow, so be smart.  Probably this is what Warren Buffet said, it is important to buy a good stock at the right price rather than buying a good stock at the wrong price. There is no fixed answer to your question. It can be anything. You can check what analysts, someone with reputation of predicting correctly(not always), say would be the increase/decrease in the price of a stock in the projected future. They do quite a lot of data crunching to reach a price. Don't take their values as sacrosanct but collate from a number of sources and take an average or some sorts of it. You can then take an educated guess of how much you would be willing to pay depending the gain or loss predicted.

If you are going to invest in company ABC, shouldn't you have some idea of whether the stock price of $30, $60, or $100 is the bargain price you want?  I'd consider this part of the due diligence if you are picking individual stocks.  Mutual funds can be a bit different in automatically doing fractional shares and not quite as easy to analyze as a company's financials in a sense. I'm more concerned with the fact that you don't seem to have a good idea of what the price is that you are willing to buy the stock so that you take advantage of the volatility of the market. ETFs would be similar to mutual funds in some ways though I'd probably consider the question that may be worth considering here is how much do you want to optimize the price you pay versus adding $x to your position each time.  I'd probably consider estimating a ballpark and then setting the limit price somewhere within that.  I wouldn't necessarily set it to the maximum price you'd be willing to pay unless you are trying to ride a \"\"hot\"\" ETF using some kind of momentum strategy.  The downside of a momentum strategy is that it can take a while to work out the kinks and I don't use one though I do remember a columnist from MSN Money that did that kind of trading regularly.\"",
            "There are a couple of things you could do, but it may depend partly on the type of orders your broker has available to you. Firstly, if you are putting your limit order the night before after close of market at the top of the bids, you may be risking missing out if bid & offer prices increase by the time the market opens the next day. On the other hand, if bid & offer prices fall at the open of the next day you should get your order filled at or below your limit price. Secondly, you could be available at the market open to see if prices are going up or down and then work out the price you want to buy at then and work out the quantity you can buy at that price. I personally don't like this method because you usually get too emotional, start chasing the market if prices start rising, or start regretting buying at a price and prices fall straight afterwards. My preferred method is this third option. If your broker provides stop orders you can use these to both get into and out of the market. How they work when trying to get into the market is that once you have done your analysis and picked a price that you would want to purchase at, you put a stop buy order in. For example, the price closed at $9.90 the previous day and there has been resistance at $10.00, so you would put a stop buy trigger if the price goes over $10, say $10.01. If your stop buy order gets triggered you can have either a buy market order or a limit order above $10.01 (say $10.02). The market order would go through immediately whilst the limit order would only go through if the price continues going to $10.02 or above. The advantage of this is that you don't get emotional trying to buy your securities whilst sitting in front of the screen, you do your analysis and set your prices whilst the market is closed, you only buy when the security is rising (not falling). As your aim is to be in long term you shouldn't be concerned about buying a little bit higher than the previous days close. On the other hand if you try and buy when the price is falling you don't know when it will stop falling. It is better to buy when the price shows signs of rising rather than falling (always follow the trend)."

        "question": "Should I re-allocate my portfolio now or let it balance out over time?",
        "answer": "When considering whether to re-allocate your portfolio or let it balance out over time, several factors should be taken into account. The current state of your portfolio, your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon are all critical in making this decision.\n\nRebalancing your portfolio involves adjusting the weightings of your assets to return to your original asset allocation. This can be done by buying or selling assets or simply by adjusting where new contributions are allocated if you're still in the contribution phase, or by altering what assets you sell if you're in the withdrawal phase  .\n\nAdvisors suggest that you can re-balance between asset classes, and when minor adjustments are needed, you can simply change the allocation of new money going into your account until you're back to your target weights. Most plans allow you to do this free of charge, and, generally, you only need to do it every few years at the most  .\n\nHowever, a significant consideration is the temptation to react to short-term market conditions. Common advice from financial experts is to avoid trying to time the market, which can harm your long-term returns. It\u2019s often recommended that you take one or more risk tolerance assessments online and ensure you're committed to sticking with a long-term plan that aligns with your risk tolerance  .\n\nTo sum up, both re-allocating your portfolio and letting it balance over time have their pros and cons. If you are comfortable with your current allocation and are able to rebalance periodically through contributions or withdrawals, you may not need to make drastic changes. On the other hand, if you believe your goals, risk tolerance, or the market environment has shifted significantly, it might be worth reconsidering your portfolio allocation. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that takes into account your individual circumstances and goals.",

            "\"As you note, your question is inherently opinion-based.  That said, if I were in your situation I would sell the stock all at once and buy whatever it is you want to buy (hopefully some index ETF or mutual fund). According to what I see, the current value of the HD stock is about $8500 and the JNJ stock is worth less than $500.  With a total investment of less than $10,000, any gain you are likely to miss by liquidating now is not going to be huge in absolute terms. This is doubly true since you were given the stock, so you have no specific reason to believe it will do well at all.  If you had picked it yourself based on careful analysis, it could be worth keeping if you \"\"believed in yourself\"\" (or even if you just wanted to test your acumen), but as it is the stock is essentially random.  Even if you want to pursue an aggressive allocation, it doesn't make sense to allocate everything to one stock for no reason.  If you were going to put everything in one stock, you'd want it to be a stock you had analyzed and picked.  (I still think it would be a bad idea, but at least it would be a more defensible idea.) So I would say the risk of your lopsided allocation (just two companies, with more than 90% of the value in just one) outweighs any risk of missing out on a gain.  If news breaks tomorrow that the CEO of Home Depot has been embezzling (or if Trump decides to go on the Twitter warpath for some reason), your investment could disappear. Another common way to think about it is: if you had $9000 today to buy stocks with, would you buy $8500 worth of HD and $500 worth of JNJ?  If not, it probably doesn't make sense to hold them just because you happen to have them. The only potential exception to my advice above would be tax considerations.  You didn't mention what your basis in the stock is.  Looking at historical prices, it looks like if all the stock was 20 years old you'd have a gain of about $8000, and if all of it was 10 years old you'd have a gain of about $6000.  If your tax situation is such that selling all the stock at once would push you into a higher tax bracket, it might make sense to sell only enough to fit into your current bracket, and sell the rest next year.  However, I think this situation is unlikely because: A) since the stock has been held for a long time, most of the gains will be at the lower long-term rate; B) if you have solid income, you can probably afford the tax; and C) if you don't have solid income, your long-term capital gains rate will likely be zero.\"",

            "I would not sell unless the stock is starting to fall in price. If you are a long term investor you can review the weekly chart on a weekly basis to determine if the stock is still up-trending. Regarding HD below is a weekly chart for the last 4 years:  Basically if the price is making Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL) it is up-trending. If it starts to make Lower Lows (LL) followed by Lower Highs (LH) then the uptrend is over and the stock could be entering a downtrend. With HD, the price has been up-trending but seems to now be hitting some headwinds. It has been making some HHs followed by some HLs throughout the last 2 years. It did make a LL in late August 2015 but then recovered nicely to make a new HH, so the uptrend was not broken. In early November 2016 it made another LL but this time it seems to be followed by a LH in mid-December 2016. This could be clear evidence that the uptrend may be ending. The final confirmation would be if the price drops below the early November low of $119.20 (the orange line). If price drops below this price it would be confirmation that the uptrend is over and this should be the point at which you should sell your HD shares. You could place an automatic stop loss order just below $119.20 so that you don't even need to monitor the stock frequently. Another indication that the uptrend may be in trouble is the divergence between the HHs of the price and the peaks of a momentum indicator (in this case the MACD). The two sloping red lines show that the price made HHs in April and August 2016 whilst the momentum indicator made LHs at these peaks in the price. As the lines are sloping in different directions it is demonstrating negative divergence, which means that the momentum of the uptrend is slowing down and can act as an early warning system to be more cautious in the near future. So the question you could be asking is when is a good time to sell out of HD (or at least some of your HD to rebalance)? Why sell something that is still increasing in price? Only sell if you can determine that the price will not be increasing anymore in the near to medium term.",

        "question": "Bond ETFs vs actual bonds",
        "answer": "Bond ETFs and actual bonds both serve as investment vehicles centered around debt instruments, but they have distinct differences that might make one more suitable than the other depending on an investor's goals and strategies.\n\n**Bond ETFs** (Exchange-Traded Funds) are similar to mutual funds in that they hold a diversified mix of assets, in this case, bonds, as described in their prospectus. They are traded on stock exchanges just like individual stocks, allowing for flexibility in buying and selling throughout the trading day. This can result in lower transaction costs and no load fees, unlike some mutual funds which may charge for entering or exiting the investment. Additionally, ETFs can be more accessible for investors who have brokerage accounts but are not directly affiliated with a mutual fund company \u2013 allowing them to avoid potential transaction fees associated with mutual fund purchases. However, trading ETFs typically involves purchasing whole shares, which can complicate the investment of specific dollar amounts and the reinvestment of dividends .\n\n**Actual Bonds**, on the other hand, are individual debt securities issued by an entity such as a government, municipality, or corporation. When you invest in an actual bond, you lend money to the issuer who, in return, promises to pay interest at predetermined intervals and repay the principal upon maturity. Bonds offer various maturities and credit qualities, and the investor directly owns the bond and the associated cash flows. Actual bonds are not traded on an exchange, which means they might be less liquid and more challenging to sell quickly compared to ETFs.\n\nOne key aspect that differentiates actual bonds from bond ETFs is the certainty of returns. If held to maturity, an individual bond's returns are predetermined, whereas a bond ETF's returns are subject to market fluctuations. Additionally, individual bonds can be held until maturity to avoid capital loss due to interest rate changes, although they may have interest rate risk if sold before maturity. Bond ETFs, conversely, do not have a maturity date, so the interest rate risk remains throughout the investment period.\n\nThe choice between bond ETFs and actual bonds thus depends on factors such as liquidity needs, investment size, specific investment strategies, and tolerance for interest rate risk. Investors seeking more predictable cash flows and returns might prefer actual bonds, while those looking for more liquidity and lower investment costs may opt for bond ETFs. It is important to consider the specific attributes of each investment vehicle in the context of one's portfolio objectives and risk tolerance.",

That could as easily be an ETF, but happens not to be.",
            "As keshlam said, an ETF holds various assets, but the level of diversification depends on the individual ETF. A bond ETF can focus on short term bonds, long term bonds, domestic bonds, foreign bonds, government bonds, corporate bonds, low risk, high risk, or a mixture of any of those. Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX) for instance tries to be geographically diverse."

        "question": "Why would I pick a specific ETF over an equivalent Mutual Fund?",
        "answer": "Choosing an ETF over a mutual fund can depend on various factors related to your investment needs and preferences. Here are some reasons why you might choose an ETF:\n\n1. **Trading Flexibility**: ETFs are traded like stocks, which means you can buy or sell them throughout the trading day at market price, offering more control over the price at which you buy or sell. Mutual funds are priced once at the end of the trading day, and all buy and sell orders are executed at that price .\n\n2. **No Load Fees**: Unlike many mutual funds, ETFs typically don't have front-end or back-end load fees, which can save you money if you frequently trade in and out of funds .\n\n3. **Accessibility**: ETFs may be more accessible in certain accounts. For example, if the mutual funds you are interested in aren't available through your 401k, an ETF equivalent might be a solution if you have access to a brokerage option within your plan .\n\n4. **Investment Minimums**: Some mutual funds have high minimum investment requirements, which can be a barrier to entry for some investors. ETFs can be purchased for the price of a single share, making them more accessible to investors with less capital to invest .\n\n5. **Fractional Shares**: Mutual funds often allow you to own fractional shares, making it easier to invest a specific dollar amount regularly. Most ETFs require you to purchase whole shares, which can make regular investing of fixed dollar amounts more complicated, although some brokerage services might offer fractional ETF shares .\n\n6. **Expense Ratios**: While this can vary, some ETFs may have lower expense ratios than their mutual fund equivalents. However, depending on your broker's fee structure for ETFs compared to mutual funds, this advantage may be offset by trading commissions .\n\n7. **Potential Tax Efficiency**: ETFs might offer greater tax efficiency due to their unique creation and redemption process, which can help minimize capital gains distributions compared to mutual funds. However, this can depend on various factors, including the specific investment products and your personal tax situation .\n\n8. **Short-Selling, Options, and Limit Orders**: ETFs give you the ability to utilize advanced trading strategies such as short-selling, trading options, and placing limit orders. These are generally not possible with mutual funds, which might be more suitable for investors pursuing active trading strategies .\n\nIt's important to note that not all ETFs and mutual funds are created equal, and some of these possible advantages may not apply to every ETF or mutual fund option available in the market. Always consider your individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and the specific characteristics of the ETF and mutual fund you are comparing before making a decision.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "There are times when investing in an ETF is more convenient than a mutual fund. When you invest in a mutual fund, you often have an account directly with the mutual fund company, or you have an account with a mutual fund broker.  Mutual funds often have either a front end or back end load, which essentially gives you a penalty for jumping in and out of funds. ETFs are traded exactly like stocks, so there is inherently no load when buying or selling.  If you have a brokerage account and you want to move funds from a stock to a mutual fund, an ETF might be more convenient. With some accounts, an ETF allows you to invest in a fund that you would not be able to invest in otherwise.  For example, you might have a 401k account through your employer.  You might want to invest in a Vanguard mutual fund, but Vanguard funds are not available with your 401k.  If you have access to a brokerage account inside your 401k, you can invest in the Vanguard fund through the associated ETF. Another reason that you might choose an ETF over a mutual fund is if you want to try to short the fund.",
            "Something to consider is how do you want to handle fractional shares. Most open-end funds can easily go to fractional shares to that if you want to invest $500 in a fund each month, it is a relatively easy transaction where some shares will be fractional and handled easily. An ETF may not always work that way unless you go through something like Sharebuilder that would allow the fractional shares as if the ETF is trading at $150/share, you could buy 3 shares but still have $50 that you want to invest but can't as stocks trade in whole share numbers usually. This is without adding brokerage commissions. Depending on the broker, re-investing dividends may or may not be that simple as fractional shares could be a problem since those 3 shares aren't likely to have enough of a dividend to equal another share being bought with the proceeds. If you want the flexibility of stop and limit orders then the ETF may make more sense while the open-end fund is simply to invest whole dollar amounts that then lead to fractional shares. Don't forget to factor in minimums and other stuff as VFIAX may have a bit of a minimum to it as well as possible fees that could be annoying as I remember VFINX having some account maintenance fees that were a bit irksome back in the day that may still be around in some cases so be sure to read the fine print on things.",
            "In the case of VFIAX versus VOO, if you're a buy-and-hold investor, you're probably better off with the mutual fund because you can buy fractional shares. However, in general the expense ratio for ETFs will be lower than equivalent mutual funds (even passive index funds). They are the same in this case because the mutual fund is Admiral Class, which has a $10,000 minimum investment that not all people may be able to meet. Additionally, ETFs are useful when you don't have an account with the mutual fund company (i.e. Vanguard), and buying the mutual fund would incur heavy transaction fees."

        "question": "Can PE ratio of stocks be compared to other investments?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of stocks can be compared to other investments, but it's important to consider the context and the nature of the investments being compared. The P/E ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate the relative value of a company's shares. It's calculated by dividing the current market price of a stock by its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nWhen comparing the P/E ratio of stocks to other investments, such as bonds, real estate, or commodities, investors should be aware that these asset classes have different financial metrics and risk profiles that are suited for their evaluation.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Bonds: The equivalent measure in the bond market might be the yield to maturity or the interest rate relative to the bond's price. Bonds don't have earnings like stocks, so the P/E ratio isn't directly applicable. Instead, measures like the credit spread over a risk-free rate can provide a comparison of the relative value.\n\n2. Real Estate: The real estate investment might be evaluated using the capitalization rate (cap rate), which is the annual rental income divided by the property's value. Unlike the P/E ratio, which is based on earnings, the cap rate is based on the income-generating potential of the property.\n\n3. Commodities: Commodities are often assessed based on supply and demand dynamics, cost of production, and macroeconomic factors. They don't generate earnings, so P/E is not a relevant measure.\n\nWhile P/E ratios can provide a sense of value, they should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative factors when comparing different types of investments. It's also crucial to recognize that higher or lower P/E values may be interpreted differently across industries and asset classes, as the expectations for growth and risk are not the same.\n\nIf you have specific documentation or financial reports that you would like to compare P/E ratios from or have any questions about, please let me know, and I can assist you with that.",

Or at least that's the theory. In practice PE ratio is used not as a way of measuring what the stock price itself will do but what the fundamental value of holding that share is compared to its price. It is a way of measuring what a company is worth compared to its price and comparing it against other companies to find companies where the underlying value of the company is underrepresented by the price. Comparing PE ratios within the same industry or sector is the most valid use for this (other than comparing previous years of the same company) and the validity of the comparison drops as the structure of the firm you are comparing with gets more different to that of the company. Each industry has its own \"\"typical\"\" average PE ratio and these differ wildly between industries so in a great many cases even comparing PE ratios between similar stocks in different industries isn't valid. Any weird pseudo PE ratio that you create for other instruments will be meaningless. In general the best way to compare investments across multiple instruments is by comparing returns. when comparing stocks to other instruments you may want to use the return on stock price or the return on capital employed (ROCE) depending on whether you want to compare the trading performance or the fundamental performance.\"",

        "question": "What happens to bonds values when interest rates rise? [duplicate]",
        "answer": "When interest rates rise, the values of existing bonds typically decrease. This inverse relationship between bond values and interest rates arises because new bonds would be issued at the higher current interest rates, making older bonds with lower interest rates less attractive\u2014unless they are sold at lower prices. This is explained by an example: if the existing interest rate is 5% and a bond with a face value of $100 offers a $5 coupon (yielding a 5% return), and then the interest rates rise to 10%, a newly issued bond with a face value of $100 would offer a $10 coupon. In order for the old bond to remain competitive and offer a 10% yield, the price at which it is sold would need to fall to $50, at which a $5 coupon represents a 10% yield on the investment amount .\n\nAdditionally, bond prices are inversely proportional to interest rates. This means that as interest rates increase, the discounted present value of future bond payments (the bond prices) decreases, which is more pronounced with longer maturity bonds due to the more significant cumulative effect of higher interest rates over time .",

There are plenty of bond funds like Templeton Global or ETFs that offer such features. Find one that will work for you.",
            "It depends a lot on your investment period and the quality of the bonds that you want to invest. For example, if you want to invest until the maturity of the bonds, and the bonds are very safe (i.e. they are not expected to default), it does not matter that the interest rate rise. That is because at the maturity of the bond it will converge to its maturity value which will be independent of the change of the interest rates (although on the middle of the life the price of the bond will go down, but the coupon should remain constant -unless is a floating coupon bond-). An option could be to invest in an ETF with short term bonds (e.g. 1 year) with AAA credit rating (high quality, so very low default rate). It won't yield much, but is more than 0% if you hold it until maturity."

        "question": "Inverse Relationship between Volatility and Beta",
        "answer": "Upon searching the document provided for the inverse relationship between volatility and beta, there was no direct mention of this specific concept. However, the document does discuss aspects of beta, volatility, and options pricing, as well as the behavior of stocks in relation to market movements and how betas can change with the time scale used in the calculation .\n\nTo elaborate based on general financial knowledge, beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that a stock is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 means it is less volatile. There isn\u2019t an inverse relationship between volatility and beta per se; instead, beta is a direct measure of relative volatility. For instance, if a stock has a beta of 0.8, it is less volatile than the market\u2014it is expected to move only 80% for every 100% move in the market index.\n\nVolatility refers to the stock's standard deviation of returns and is an absolute measure of risk. In contrast, beta represents systematic risk, which is the part of a stock's risk that is correlated with the overall market risk and cannot be diversified away.\n\nIf you were looking for information on an inverse relationship, it might typically refer to the inverse relationship between a stock's price and its volatility\u2014often observed when a stock\u2019s price decreases, volatility tends to increase and vice versa. But this is not directly related to the concept of beta.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further clarification on this financial concept or any related topic, please feel free to ask.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"For any isolated equity market, its beta will less resemble the betas of all other interconnected equity markets.  For interconnected markets, beta is not well-dispersed, especially during a world expansion because richer nations have more wealth thus a dominant influence over smaller nations' equity markets causing a convergence.  If the world is in recession, or a country is in recession, all betas or the recessing country's beta will start to diverge, respectively.  If the world's economies diverge, their equity markets' betas will too.  If a country is having financial difficulty, its beta too will diverge. Beta is correlation against a ratio of variance, so variance or \"\"volatiliy\"\" is only half of that equation.  Correlation or \"\"direction\"\" is the other half.  The ratio of variance will give the magnitude of beta, and correlation will give the sign or \"\"direction\"\". Therefore, interconnected emerging equity markets should have higher beta magnitudes because they are more variant but should generally over time have signs that more closely resemble the rest.  A disconnected emerging equity market will improbably have average betas both by magnitude and direction.\""

        "question": "Bid/ask spreads for index funds",
        "answer": "The document provides information on bid/ask spreads in relation to index funds, with specific reference to the structure of the fund. If an index fund is structured as an open-end mutual fund, there is no bid/ask spread because transactions are priced once a day. On the other hand, if it is an exchange-traded fund (ETF), bid/ask spreads come into play as authorized participants take advantage of the spread to help the fund track the index effectively. This is accomplished through the Creation and Redemption unit construct of ETFs, involving \"in-kind\" transactions to create or redeem shares of the fund .\n\nAdditionally, there is a clarification on how transactions occur regardless of being an individual investor or a market maker. Everyone buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price, with an order executing only when both bid and ask meet, that is, when a bid is equal to the ask. Market makers, however, do the opposite as they \"buy at the bid and sell at the ask,\" profiting from the spread .\n\nThe details provided do not expound on the specific sizes of bid/ask spreads for index funds, nor do they quantify the spreads. For more comprehensive understanding, the document suggests looking into John C. Bogle's investing books, such as \"Common Sense on Mutual Funds: New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor\" and \"Bogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor\" .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"First, what structure does your index fund have?  If it is an open-end mutual fund, there are no bid/ask spread as the structure of this security is that it is priced once a day and transactions are done with that price.  If it is an exchange-traded fund, then the question becomes how well are authorized participants taking advantage of the spread to make the fund track the index well?  This is where you have to get into the Creation and Redemption unit construct of the exchange-traded fund where there are \"\"in-kind\"\" transactions done to either create new shares of the fund or redeem out shares of the fund.  In either case, you are making some serious assumptions about the structure of the fund that don't make sense given how these are built. Index funds have lower expense ratios and are thus cheaper than other mutual funds that may take on more costs.  If you want suggested reading on this, look at the investing books of John C. Bogle who studied some of this rather extensively, in addition to being one of the first to create an index fund that became known as \"\"Bogle's Folly,\"\" where a couple of key ones would be \"\"Common Sense on Mutual Funds: New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor\"\" and \"\"Bogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor.\"\" In the case of an open-end fund, there has to be a portion of the fund in cash to handle transaction costs of running the fund as there are management fees to come from running the fund in addition to dividends from the stocks that have to be carefully re-invested and other matters that make this quite easy to note.  Vanguard 500 Index Investor portfolio(VFINX) has .38% in cash as an example here where you could look at any open-end mutual fund's portfolio and notice that there may well be some in cash as part of how the fund is managed.  It\u2019s the Execution, Stupid would be one of a few articles that looks at the idea of \"\"tracking error\"\" or how well does an index fund actually track the index where it can be noted that in some cases, there can be a little bit of active management in the fund. Just as a minor side note, when I lived in the US I did invest in index funds and found them to be a good investment.  I'd still recommend them though I'd argue that while some want to see these as really simple investments, there can be details that make them quite interesting to my mind. How is its price set then? The price is computed by taking the sum value of all the assets of the fund minus the liabilities and divided by the number of outstanding shares.  The price of the assets would include the closing price on the stock rather than a bid or ask, similar pricing for bonds held by the fund, derivatives and cash equivalents.  Similarly, the liabilities would be costs a fund has to pay that may not have been paid yet such as management fees, brokerage costs, etc. Is it a weighted average of all the underlying stock spreads, or does   it stand on its own and stems from the usual supply & demand laws ? There isn't any spread used in determining the \"\"Net Asset Value\"\" for the fund.  The fund prices are determined after the market is closed and so a closing price can be used for stocks. The liabilities could include the costs to run the fund as part of the accounting in the fund, that most items have to come down to either being an asset, something with a positive value, or a liability, something with a negative value. Something to consider also is the size of the fund.  With over $7,000,000,000 in assets, a .01% amount is still $700,000 which is quite a large amount in some ways.\""

Here are a few arguments mentioned:\n\n1. **Risk of Cash Becoming Worthless**: There is an argument that not investing is a risk in itself, as money held in cash can lose value due to inflation or unpredictable catastrophic events, such as currency devaluation during economic crises. For instance, people who kept cash during the 1998 default of the Russian Federation lost money because the cash became worthless overnight, while those who had invested in other assets retained some value .\n\n2. **Alternative Priorities**: It's suggested that there may be better or more meaningful uses for excess funds than accumulating more wealth through investing. These could include charitable contributions, supporting education or various political or social causes, funding research, helping friends and family, or enjoying experiences like vacations. The implication is that investing for more money may not always align with personal values or objectives .\n\n3. **Investor Psychology**: Another argument alludes to human psychology, mentioning that most people are not naturally equipped to make the rigorous and rapid decisions required by the dynamics of financial markets. This psychological aspect can lead to investors frequently losing money, particularly in zero-sum markets like derivatives where one participant's gain is another's loss .\n\nIt's important to note that these arguments do not provide a one-size-fits-all rationale against investing but rather point out considerations that may lead some individuals to decide against it based on their unique situations and goals.",

They're asking about your priorities and whether you might have something better to do than inevesting: And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain   rich man brought forth plentifully: and he thought within himself,   saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my   fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and   build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And   I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many   years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be   required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast   provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not   rich toward God. -- Luke 12:16-21 Christian or otherwise, there may be better things for you to do with your excess cash - indeed, with your life - than simply invest it to bring yourself more money. Many people find charitable contributions more important than spending a little more money on themselves (immediately or in the future). Of course, you will need to decide what these things are that matter to you. Perhaps you would like to contribute to traditional charities. Perhaps you would like to fund education, or a religious organization, or the Democratic Party, or the Republican Party, or the Libertarian Party, or the Green Party, or the Tea Party, or Occupy Wall Street. Perhaps you'd like to fund research into something. Perhaps you simply have friends and family that you want to make happy. Perhaps a small vacation to spend time with family is worth more to you now than the investment returns will be worth later. Moreover, note that economic decisions like this are made on the margin - it's not so much a question of whether you invest at all, but whether you should invest more or less, and spend/donate more or less. I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:      I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all   kind of fruits:    I made me pools of water, to water therewith the   wood that bringeth forth trees:    I got me servants and maidens, and   had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great   and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:       I   gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings   and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the   delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all   sorts. So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.     And whatsoever mine   eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any   joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor: and this was my portion of   all my labor.      Then I looked on all the works that my hands had   wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all   was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the   sun. -- Ecclesiastes 2:4-11 Because in the long run, we're all dead.

        "answer": "Delta, one of the \"Greeks,\" is a measure of how the price of an option is expected to change with a $1 change in the price of the underlying security or index. However, using Delta alone to calculate the option premium for a target price is an oversimplification of the option pricing process.\n\nThe file discusses that while simple formulas like Delta can provide estimates, they can often deviate significantly from the real market value of an option. For more accurate pricing, more complex models such as the Black-Scholes model or binomial models are typically used. These models take into account various variables and scenarios that can impact the option's price and are used to simulate and predict its behavior under different market conditions. The aim is to arrive at a price that is as close to the actual value of the option as possible to avoid arbitrage opportunities by competitors.\n\nAdditionally, the document indicates that for a more nuanced approach, a \"delta-gamma approximation\" or \"Greek/sensitivities based profit and loss attribution\" can be used to take into account the sensitivities of an option's price to various factors .\n\nIn summary, the Delta can give you an initial estimate of how an option's price might change with the underlying asset's price movements, but it isn't sufficient for calculating the actual option premium for a given target. A more robust approach would require the use of comprehensive option pricing models that include various market variables and scenarios.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "In a simple world yes, but not in the real world. Option pricing isn't that simplistic in real life. Generally option pricing uses a Monte Carlo simulation of the Black Scholes formula/binomial and then plot them nomally to decide the optimum price of the option. Primarily multiple scenarios are generated and under that specific scenario the option is priced and then a price is derived for the option in real life, using the prices which were predicted in the scenarios.  So you don't generate a single price for an option, because you have to look into the future to see how the price of the option would behave, under the real elements of the market. So what you price is an assumption that this is the most likely value under my scenarios, which I predicted into the future. Because of the market, if you price an option higher/lower than another competitor you introduce an option for arbitrage by others. So you try to be as close to the real value of the option, which your competitor also does. The more closer your option value is to the real price the better it is for all. Did you try the book from Hull ? EDIT: While pricing you generally take variables which would affect the price of your option. The more variables you take(more nearer you are to the real situation) the more realistic your price will be and you would converge on the real price faster. So simple formula is an option, but the deviations maybe large from the real value. And you would end up loosing money, most of the time. So the complicated formula is there for getting a more accurate price, not to confuse people. You can use your formula, but there will be odds stacked against you to loose money, from the onset, because you didn't consider the variables which might/would affect the price of your option.",
            "\"One thing I would like to clear up here is that Black Scholes is just a model that makes some assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying + a few other things and with some rather complicated math, out pops the Black Scholes formula. Black Scholes gives you the \"\"real\"\" price under the assumptions of the model. Your definition of what a \"\"real\"\" price entails will depend on what assumptions you make. With that being said, Black Scholes is popular for pricing European options because of the simplicity and speed of using an analytic formula as opposed to having a more complex model that can only be evaluated using a numerical method, as DumbCoder mentioned (should note that, for many other types of derivative contracts, e.g. American or Bermudan style exercise, the Black Scholes analytic formula is not appropriate). The other important thing to note here is that the market does not necessarily need to agree with the assumptions made in the Black Scholes model (and they most certainly do not) to use it. If you look at implied vols for a set of options which have the same expiration but differing strike prices, you may find that the implied vols for each contract differ and this information is telling you to what degree the traders in the market for those contracts disagree with the lognormal distribution assumption made by Black Scholes. Implied vol is generally the thing to look at when determining cheapness/expensiveness of an option contract. With all that being said, what I'm assuming you are interested in is either called a \"\"delta-gamma approximation\"\" or more generally \"\"Greek/sensitivities based profit and loss attribution\"\" (in case you wanted to Google some more about it). Here is an example that is relevant to your question. Let's say we had the following European call contract: Popping this in to BS formula gives you a premium of $4.01, delta of 0.3891 and gamma of 0.0217. Let's say you bought it, and the price of the stock immediately moves to 55 and nothing else changes, re-evaluating with the BS formula gives ~6.23. Whereas using a delta-gamma approximation gives: The actual math doesn't work out exactly and that is due to the fact that there are higher order Greeks than gamma but as you can see here clearly they do not have much of an impact considering a 10% move in the underlying is almost entirely explained by delta and gamma.\""

Katherine Buck from Betterment points out that attempting to time the market is detrimental to investment returns, and instead, regular deposits, compounding returns, tax-efficient auto-rebalancing, and reinvesting dividends are advocated as the best growth strategies. There's also a mention that Betterment's model may tempt investors to tweak their allocations which could negatively affect long-term results .\n\n- **Vanguard Life Strategy Funds**: These funds are suited for investors who want to maintain a specific allocation between stocks and bonds that does not automatically adjust over time like Target Retirement funds do. The Vanguard Life Strategy fund might be a better fit if you don't have a specific retirement date in mind and prefer a consistent asset allocation strategy. It's mentioned that you can use Vanguard's Total Market funds for your own allocations and manage it easily. However, you should be aware of the fee structures, which may differ from Betterment as transaction fees for buying the ETFs are not specified .\n\n- **Target Retirement Funds**: These are ideal for investors who know their retirement date and would like their investments to automatically become more conservative as they approach that time. Target Retirement funds automatically adjust the asset allocation to more conservative investments as the target date approaches, which is primarily designed to protect those near retirement from significant losses .\n\nIn conclusion, the choice between Betterment, Vanguard Life Strategy, and Target Retirement funds should be based on your investment style, need for simplicity or active management, understanding of fees, and how close you are to retirement. It's recommended that investors take risk tolerance assessments to ensure they are comfortable with their long-term investment plans and understand the level of risk they can handle .",

            "\"First, congratulations on choosing to invest in low cost passively managed plans. If you choose any one of these options and stick with it, you will already be well ahead of most individual investors. Almost all plans will allow you to re-balance between asset classes. With some companies, sales agents will encourage you to sell your overweighted assets and buy underweighted assets as this generates brokerage commissions for them, but when you only need to make minor adjustments, you can simply change the allocation of the new money going into your account until you are back to your target weights. Most plans will let you do this for free, and in general, you will only need to do this every few years at most. I don't see much reason for you to be in the Target funds. The main feature of these plans is that they gradually shift you to a more conservative asset allocation over time, and are designed to prevent people who are close to retirement from being too aggressive and risking a major loss just before retirement. It's very likely that at your age, most plans will have very similar recommendations for your allocation, with equities at 80% or more, and this is unlikely to change for the next few decades. The main benefits of betterment seems to be simplicity and ease of use, but there is one concern I would have for you with betterment. Precisely because it is so easy to tweak your allocation, I'm concerned that you might hurt your long-term results by reacting to short-term market conditions: I know I said I wanted a hands off account, but what if the stock market crashes and I want to allocate more to bonds??? One of the biggest reasons that stock returns are better than bond returns on average is that you are being paid to accept additional risk, and living with significant ups and downs is part of what it means to be in the stock market. If you are tempted to take money out of an asset class when it has been \"\"losing/feels dangerous\"\" and put more in when it is \"\"winning/feels safe\"\", my concerns is that you will end up buying high and selling low. I'd recommend taking a look at this article on the emotional cycle of investing. My point is simply that it's very likely that if you are moving money in and out of stocks based on volatility, you're much less likely to get the full market return over the long term, and might be better off putting more weight in asset classes with lower volatility. Either way, I'd recommend taking one or more risk tolerance assessments online and making sure you're committed to sticking with a long-term plan that doesn't involve more risk than you can really live with. I tend to lean toward Vanguard Life Strategy simply because Vanguard as a company has been around longer, but betterment does seem very accessible to a new investor. Best of luck with your decision!\"",
            "Katherine from Betterment here.  I wanted to address your inquiry and another comment regarding our services.  I agree with JAGAnalyst - it's detrimental to your returns and potential for growth if you try to time the market.  That's why Betterment offers customized asset allocation for each portfolio based on the nature of your goal, time horizon, and how much you are able to put towards your investments.  We do this so regardless of what's happening in the markets, you can feel comfortable that your asset allocation plus other determining factors will get you where you need to go, without having to time your investing.  We also put out quite a bit of content regarding market timing and why we think it's an unwise practice.  We believe continuously depositing to your goal, especially through auto-deposits, compounding returns, tax-efficient auto-rebalancing, and reinvesting dividends are the best ways to grow your assets. Let me know if you would like additional information regarding Betterment accounts and our best practices.  I am available at buck@betterment.com and am always happy to speak about Betterment's services. Katherine Buck, Betterment Community Manager",
            "Life Strategy funds are more appropriate if you want to maintain a specific allocation between stocks and bonds that doesn't automatically adjustment like the Target Retirement funds which have a specific date.  Thus, it may make more sense to take whichever Life Strategy fund seems the most appropriate and ride with it for a while unless you know when you plan to retire and access those funds. In theory, you could use Vanguard's Total Market funds,i.e. Total Stock Market, Total International, and Total Bond, and have your own allocations between stocks and bonds be managed pretty easily and don't forget that the fees can come in a couple of flavors as betterment doesn't specify where the transaction fees for buying the ETFs are coming out just as something to consider."

        "question": "Why do stocks split?",
        "answer": "Stocks may split for a variety of reasons, but the main objective is often to make shares seem more affordable to small investors, even though the underlying value of the company has not changed. Here are some common reasons why a company might decide to split its stock:\n\n1. **Psychological Appeal**: A lower stock price might be more attractive to investors. There is a psychological perception that the stock is more affordable, even though the lower price does not change the actual value of the overall investment.\n\n2. **Liquidity**: More shares in circulation can result in greater liquidity for a stock, which facilitates trading and may reduce the bid-ask spread.\n\n3. **Perceived Value**: Companies want their shares to trade within a certain price range. If a stock price gets too high, it may seem overpriced to some investors, even if the underlying company fundamentals are solid.\n\n4. **Broadening Ownership**: A lower share price allows more investors to buy shares, potentially broadening the company's shareholder base.\n\n5. **Benchmarking**: Occasionally, companies might split their stock to keep their share price in line with peer companies.\n\n6. **Options and Employee Compensation**: Stock splits can also make it easier to grant stock options at lower strike prices or distribute shares to employees.\n\nIt's important to note that a stock split does not change the market capitalization of a company; it merely increases the number of shares outstanding and proportionally lowers the share price. If you have specific questions regarding stock splits in relation to a document or a certain company, please provide more context or ask a related question to which I could provide a more targeted response.",

            "Stock splits are typically done to increase the liquidity of stock merely by converting every stock of the company into multiple stocks of lower face value. For example, if the initial face value of the stock was $10 and the stock got split 10:1, the new face value of the stock would be $1 each. This has a proportional effect on the market value of the stock also. If the stock was trading at $50, after the split the stock should ideally adjust to $5. This is to ensure that despite the stock split, the market capitalization of the company should remain the same. Number of Shares * Stock Price = Market Capitalization = CONSTANT"

        "question": "Any Tips on How to Get the Highest Returns Within 4 Months by Investing in Stocks?",
        "answer": "When looking to achieve the highest returns within a short period of time, like 4 months, by investing in stocks, it's important to understand that high returns are usually associated with high risk. There are multiple strategies that can be considered, each with its own set of risks and potential returns:\n\n1. Risky Assets: You may consider investing in assets that carry higher risk but also have the potential for higher returns, like penny stocks or options. These can be volatile but may offer significant upside if you are willing to take on the risk. However, there's a real possibility of losing all your invested capital with these assets  .\n\n2. Trend Following and Technical Analysis: Using technical analysis to look for stocks in an uptrend can also be a strategy. An uptrend is characterized by higher highs and higher lows on the stock charts, which may signal a stock could continue rising in price  .\n\n3. Sector Analysis: Fundamental analysis can help to identify sectors that are expected to perform well based on current economic conditions. For example, if oil prices are rising, sectors like energy and materials might benefit. You can gain exposure to these sectors through individual stocks or ETFs  .\n\n4. Auto-deposits and Compounding Returns: Regular investing into your portfolio through auto-deposits and the compounding of returns can also be an effective method over time. Although this approach is generally preferred for long-term investing, it helps to continuously grow your assets  .\n\nRemember, while these strategies can be used to aim for higher returns, they also involve more risk, especially within such a short time frame. It's important to do thorough research, consult with a financial advisor to develop a strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance, and be prepared for the possibility of significant losses along with potential gains.",

            "\"What you're asking for is a short-term, large return investment. When looking for big returns in a short period of time, risk is inevitable. The more risk you are willing to assume, the higher your potential returns. Of course, the flip is is that the higher your risk, the higher the potential to lose all your money! Since this is an exercise for school (and not real money and not your life savings) your best bet is to \"\"go big or go home\"\". You can safely assume 100% risk! Don't look for value stocks, dividend stocks, or anything that pays a steady return over a long period of time. Instead, look for something risky that has the potential of going up, up, up in the next few months. Are you allowed to trade options in your fake portfolio? Options can have big risk and big reward potential. Penny stocks are super volatile, too. Do some research, look for a fad. In other words, you will most likely lose it all. But you get a little lucky, you could win this thing outright by making some risky investments. A 5% chance of winning $3000 vs 95% of going broke may be pretty good odds if everyone else is value investing for just a few months. You will need to get lucky. Go big or go home!\"",

Use a stochastic indicator and buy on the dips down when the stochastic is in the oversold position (below 20) and and crossing over about to turn back upwards. Or you can also use the stochastic to trade shares that have been ranging between two prices (say between $10 and $12) for a while. As the price approaches the $10 support and the stochastic is in oversold, you would buy as the price rebounds off the $10 support and the stochastic crosses and starts rebounding back up. As the price starts reaching the resistance at $12 (with stocastic in overbought at above 80) you would look to sell and take profits. If you were able to do short selling in the competition, you could short sell at this point in time and make profits on the way up as well as on the way down. There are many more techniques you could use to set up trade opportunities using technical analysis, so it may be a subject you could research further before the comptition begins. Good luck.",

        "question": "Are there index tracking funds that avoid the \u201cbuy high - sell low\u201d problem?",
        "answer": "Yes, there are index tracking funds that aim to avoid the \"buy high - sell low\" problem typically associated with market capitalization-weighted funds. One such alternative is \"equal weight\" funds, which allocate the same amount of capital to each stock in the index, irrespective of their market caps. This approach can potentially reduce the risk of overconcentration in stocks that have become expensive relative to their fundamentals. For example, the Rydex S&P Equal-Weight ETF is mentioned as a fund operating on such a principle .\n\nIn a market-capitalization-weighted index fund, the fund itself doesn't actively buy or sell securities but merely adjusts its holdings to reflect the investments entering or leaving the fund (due to redemptions or purchases). The value of each stock in the fund changes in proportion to its market cap, so no active buying high and selling low occurs within the fund itself. This characteristic makes cap-weighted funds cost-effective due to low trading costs and tax-efficient since they don't frequently realize capital gains that trigger taxes .\n\nNevertheless, it is when investors buy into or sell out of market-cap-weighted funds that they potentially \"buy high and sell low,\" because they invest more in higher-priced stocks which comprise a larger part of the fund's value at the time of purchase. Some investors might consider fundamental-weighted or equal-weighted index funds to get a similar effect to rebalancing, where the fund commonly sells securities that have appreciated to buy more of those that have declined, thereby potentially mitigating the \"buy high - sell low\" behavior .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"In a cap-weighted fund, the fund itself isn't buying or selling at all (except to support redemptions or purchases of the fund). As the value of a stock in the index goes up, then its value in the fund goes up naturally. This is the advantage of a cap-weighted fund, that it doesn't have to trade (buy and sell), it just sits on the stocks. That makes a cap-weighted fund inexpensive (low trading costs) and tax-efficient (doesn't trigger capital gains due to sales). The buying high and selling low referred to by \"\"fundamental indexation\"\" advocates like Wisdom Tree is buying high and selling low on the part of the investor. That is, when you purchase the market-cap-weighted fund, at that time that you purchase, you will spend more on the higher-priced stocks, just because they account for more of the value of the fund, and less money goes to the cheaper stocks which account for less of the value of the fund. In the prospectus for a fund they should tell you which index they use, and if the prospectus doesn't describe the weighting of the index, you could do a web search for the index name and find out how that index is constructed. A market-cap-weighted fund is the standard kind of weighting which is what you get if you buy the stocks in the index and then hold them without buying or selling. Most of the famous indexes (e.g. S&P500) are cap-weighted, with the notable exception of the Dow Jones Industrial Average which is \"\"price-weighted\"\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price-weighted_index. Price-weighting is just an archaic tradition, not something one would use for a new index design today. A fund weighted by \"\"fundamentals\"\" or equal-weighted, rather than cap-weighted, is effectively doing a kind of rebalancing, selling what's gone up to buy more of what's gone down. Rather than buying an exotic fund, you could get a similar effect by buying a balanced fund (one that mixes stocks and bonds). Then when stocks go up, your fund would sell them and buy bonds, and the fund would sell the most of the highest-market-cap stocks that make up more of the index. And vice versa of course. But the fundamental-weighted funds are fine, the more important considerations include your stocks vs. bonds percentages (asset allocation) and whether you make irrational trades instead of sticking to a plan.\"",

        "answer": "The main difference between a 'trader' and a 'stockbroker' lies in their roles and objectives in the stock market.\n\nA trader is an individual who purchases stocks with the intention of selling them for a profit. Traders are focused on making gains from the market movements and may trade more frequently, aiming to benefit from short-term price fluctuations. In essence, traders trade for a living and are typically evaluated based on their ability to consistently make money from their trading activities.\n\nOn the other hand, a stockbroker acts as an intermediary who arranges for the buying and selling of stocks by finding buyers and sellers and agreeing on a price. Stockbrokers do not purchase the stock for themselves; instead, they facilitate the transactions for their clients. Their role includes advising clients on which trades to get involved in. To be employed as a stockbroker, one needs to be licensed, but they do not need to prove that they can consistently make money, unlike traders.\n\nTo summarize, traders are market participants who buy and sell securities for their own accounts, aiming to profit from market movements.

        "question": "Can I sell a stock immediately?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can generally sell a stock immediately if the market is open and there is sufficient liquidity. When you place a sell order during market hours, the transaction is typically executed within seconds to minutes, depending on the type of order you're using and market conditions. However, there can be exceptions or specific rules depending on your brokerage's policies, the market where the stock is traded, or specific restrictions on your account or the stock.\n\nIf you have more context or are referring to specific rules or guidelines from a document or your brokerage, please provide more details or ask a more specific question.

Or heck, maybe nobody will be willing to buy it at all, at any price. Or maybe trading on this stock will be halted. Remember, the market price is just what the stock last traded at. If you put in a 'market order', you are ordering your broker to sell at the best available current price. Assuming someone's willing to buy your stock, that means you'll sell it. But if it last traded at $100, this doesn't guarantee you'll sell at anything close to that.",
            "In order to see whether you can buy or sell some given quantity of a stock at the current bid price, you need a counterparty (a buyer) who is willing to buy the number of stocks you are wishing to offload. To see whether such a counterparty exists, you can look at the stock's order book, or level two feed. The order book shows all the people who have placed buy or sell orders, the price they are willing to pay, and the quantity they demand at that price. Here is the order book from earlier this morning for the British pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline PLC.  Let's start by looking at the left-hand blue part of the book, beneath the yellow strip. This is called the Buy side. The book is sorted with the highest price at the top, because this is the best price that a seller can presently obtain. If several buyers bid at the same price, then the oldest entry on the book takes precedence. You can see we have five buyers each willing to pay 1543.0 p (that's 1543 British pence, or \u00a315.43) per share. Therefore the current bid price for this instrument is 1543.0. The first buyer wants 175 shares, the next, 300, and so on. The total volume that is demanded at 1543.0p is 2435 shares. This information is summarized on the yellow strip: 5 buyers, total volume of 2435, at 1543.0. These are all buyers who want to buy right now and the exchange will make the trade happen immediately if you put in a sell order for 1543.0 p or less. If you want to sell 2435 shares or fewer, you are good to go. The important thing to note is that once you sell these bidders a total of 2435 shares, then their orders are fulfilled and they will be removed from the order book. At this point, the next bidder is promoted up the book; but his price is 1542.5, 0.5 p lower than before. Absent any further changes to the order book, the bid price will decrease to 1542.5 p. This makes sense because you are selling a lot of shares so you'd expect the market price to be depressed. This information will be disseminated to the level one feed and the level one graph of the stock price will be updated. Thus if you have more than 2435 shares to sell, you cannot expect to execute your order at the bid price in one go. Of course, the more shares you are trying to get rid of, the further down the buy side you will have to go. In reality for a highly liquid stock as this, the order book receives many amendments per second and it is unlikely that your trade would make much difference. On the right hand side of the display you can see the recent trades: these are the times the trades were done (or notified to the exchange), the price of the trade, the volume and the trade type (AT means automatic trade).  GlaxoSmithKline is a highly liquid stock with many willing buyers and sellers. But some stocks are less liquid. In order to enable traders to find a counterparty at short notice, exchanges often require less liquid stocks to have market makers. A market maker places buy and sell orders simultaneously, with a spread between the two prices so that they can profit from each transaction. For instance Diurnal Group PLC has had no trades today and no quotes. It has a more complicated order book, enabling both ordinary buyers and sellers to list if they wish, but market makers are separated out at the top. Here you can see that three market makers are providing liquidity on this stock, Peel Hunt (PEEL), Numis (NUMS) and Winterflood (WINS). They have a very unpalatable spread of over 5% between their bid and offer prices. Further in each case the sum total that they are willing to trade is 3000 shares. If you have more than three thousand Dirunal Group shares to sell, you would have to wait for the market makers to come back with a new quote after you'd sold the first 3000.",
            "If you place a market order, you are guaranteed to sell your stock unless the stock is in a trading halt. A market order does not guarantee the price you sell the stock at.

Market Makers are paid / given lower fees in order to maintain buy and sell prices (called quotes) at most times. These conditions are usually all true, but commonly fail for these reasons: Most markets have an order type of market order that says buy/sell at any price. There are still sanity checks put in place on the price, with the exact rules for valid prices depending on the stock, so unless it's a penny stock you won't suddenly pay ten times a stock's value. *The amount you can buy sell is limited by the quantity that exists on the bid and offer.

Usually only fast traders will trade at bid/ask, those who believe the price move is imminent. If you are a long term trader you can often get better than bid or ask by placing a limit order and waiting until a market participant takes your offer.",

        "answer": "If you believe a stock is going to fall, there are several investment strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Short Selling**: This involves borrowing shares of the stock from a broker and selling them in the market with the intention of buying them back at a lower price. You profit if the stock price drops, as you can buy back the shares at the lower price and return them to the lender while pocketing the difference.\n\n2. **Put Options**: A put option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock at a specified price (strike price) before a specified date (expiration date). If the stock price falls below the strike price, the put option increases in value, and you can either sell the option for a profit or exercise the option to sell the underlying stock at the higher strike price.\n\n3. **Inverse ETFs**: These are exchange-traded funds constructed to profit from a decline in the value of an underlying benchmark. An inverse ETF uses derivatives to attempt to move in the opposite direction of the indices they track.\n\n4. **Bear Spread**: This is an options strategy that involves buying and selling two options on the same asset with different strike prices and expiration dates. It's structured to profit from a decline in the price of the underlying asset.\n\n5. **CFDs (Contracts for Difference)**: These financial instruments allow you to speculate on the price movement of assets without actually owning the underlying securities. You would open a 'sell' CFD position if you expect the price of a stock to fall.\n\nEach of these strategies carries different levels of risk and requires an understanding of market mechanisms. It's essential to research and understand these strategies thoroughly and consider seeking financial advice before engaging in any investments, especially those based on speculation of a price drop.

            "\"Aganju has mentioned put options, which are one good possibility. I would suggest considering an even easier strategy: short selling.  Technically you are borrowing the stock from someone and selling it.  At some point you repurchase the stock to return to the lender (\"\"covering your short\"\").  If the stock price has fallen, then when you repurchase it, it will be cheaper and you keep the profit. Short selling sounds complicated but it's actually very easy--your broker takes care of all the details.  Just go to your brokerage and click \"\"sell\"\" or \"\"sell short.\"\"  You can use a market or limit order just like you were selling something you own.  When it sells, you are done.  The money gets credited to your account.  At some point (after the price falls) you should repurchase it so you don't have a negative position any more, but your brokerage isn't going to hassle you for this unless you bought a lot and the stock price starts rising.  There will be limits on how much you can short, depending on how much money is in your account.  Some stocks (distressed and small stocks) may sometimes be hard to short, meaning your broker will charge you a kind of interest and/or may not be able to complete your transaction. You will need a margin account (a type of brokerage account) to either use options or short sell.  They are easy to come by, though. Note that for a given amount of starting money in your account, puts can give you a much more dramatic gain if the stock price falls.  But they can (and often do) expire worthless, causing you to lose all money you have spent on them.  If you want to maximize how much you make, use puts.  Otherwise I'd short sell. About IPOs, it depends on what you mean.  If the IPO has just completed and you want to bet that the share price will fall, either puts or short selling will work.  Before an IPO you can't short sell and I doubt you would be able to buy an option either. Foreign stocks?  Depends on whether there is an ADR for them that trades on the domestic market and on the details of your brokerage account.  Let me put it this way, if you can buy it, you can short sell it.\"",
            "\"There are three ways to do this. So far the answers posted have only mentioned two.  The three ways are: Selling short means that you borrow stock from your broker and sell it with the intent of buying it back later to repay the loan.  As others have noted, this has unlimited potential losses and limited potential gains.  Your profit or loss will go $1:$1 with the movement of the price of the stock. Buying a put option gives you the right to sell the stock at a later date on a price that you choose now.  You pay a premium to have this right, and if the stock moves against you, you won't exercise your option and will lose the premium.  Options move non-linearly with the price of the stock, especially when the expiration is far in the future.  They probably are not for a beginner, although they can be powerful if used properly. The third option is a synthetic short position.  You form this by simultaneously buying a put option and selling short a call option, both at the same strike price.  This has a risk profile that is very much like the selling the stock short, but you can accomplish it entirely with stock options.  Because you're both buying an selling, in theory you might even collect a small net premium when you open. You might ask why you'd do this given that you could just sell the stock short, which certainly seems simpler.  One reason is that it is not always possible to sell the stock short.  Recall that you have to borrow shares from your broker to sell short.  When many people want to short the stock, brokers will run out of shares to loan.

        "question": "Why naked call writing is risky compare to Covered call?",
        "answer": "Naked call writing is considered much riskier than covered call writing due to the potential for unlimited losses. When you write a naked call, you are selling an option to buy a stock that you do not currently own. If the stock's price rises significantly above the strike price, you are obligated to purchase the stock at whatever the current market price is in order to fulfill the option contract. Since there is no cap on how high a stock's price can climb, your potential loss as a writer of a naked call is unlimited. You only receive the premium initially, and if the stock price rises significantly, the cost you incur to buy the stock could be vast, potentially wiping out many times over the initial premium received.\n\nIn contrast, a covered call involves owning the underlying stock that you are writing a call option on. If the stock price rises above the strike price and the option is exercised, you are \"covered\" because you already own the shares and just have to sell them at the strike price. Your risk is limited to the difference between what you paid for the stock and the strike price at which you're obligated to sell, minus the premium you received. Therefore, while you may miss out on some potential profit if the stock price rises substantially, you are protected from the dramatic losses that can occur with naked calls because the shares you own act as a hedge .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "If the buyer exercises your option, you will have to give him the stock.  If you already own the stock, the worst that can happen is you have to give him your stock, thus losing the money you spend to buy it.  So the most you can lose is what you already spent to buy the stock (minus the price the buyer paid for your option). If you don't own the stock, you will have to buy it.  But if the stock skyrockets in value, it will be very expensive to buy it.  If for instance you buy the stock when it is worth $100, sell your covered call, and the next day the stock shoots to $1000, you will lose the $100 you got from the purchase of the stock.  But if you had used a naked call, you would have to buy the stock at $1000, and you would lose $900. Since there is no limit to how high the stock can go, there is no limit to how much money you may lose.",
            "\"A covered call risks the disparity between the purchase price and the potential forced or \"\"called\"\" sale price less the premium received. So buy a stock for $10.00 believing it will drop you or not rise above $14.00 for a given period of days. You sell a call for a $1.00 agreeing to sell your stock for $14.00 and your wrong...the stock rises and at 14.00 or above during the option period  the person who paid you the $1.00 premium gets the stock for a net effective price of $15.00. You have a gain of 5$. Your hypothecated loss is unlimited in that the stock could go to $1mil a share. That loss is an opportunity loss you still had a modest profit in actual $. The naked call is a different beast. you get the 1.00 in commission to sell a stock you don't own but must pay for that right. so lets say you net .75 in commission per share after your sell the option. as long as the stock trades below $14.00 during the period of the option you sold your golden. It rises above the strike price you must now buy that stock at market to fill the order when the counter party choses to exercise the option which results in a REAL loss of 100% of the stocks market price less the .75 a share you made.   in the scenarios a 1000 shares that for up $30.00 a share over the strike price make you $5,000 in a covered call and lose you $29,250 in a naked call.Naked calls are speculative. Covered calls are strategic.\"",

The only risk in taking a covered call position is that you will be required to sell your shares for less than the going market price. I don't entirely agree with the accepted answer given here.  You would not lose the amount you paid to buy the shares. Naked Call Option Suppose take a naked call option position by selling a call option. Since there is no limit on how high the price of the underlying share can go, you can be forced to either buy back the option at a very high price, or, in the case that the option is exercised, you can be force. to buy the underlying shares at a very high price and then sell them to the option holder at a very low price. For example, suppose you sell an Apple call option with a strike price of $100 at a premium of $2.50, and for this you receive a payment of $250. Now, if the price of Apple skyrockets to, say, $1000, then you would either have to buy back the option for about $90,000 = 100 x ($1000-$100), or, if the holder exercised the option, then you would need to buy 100 Apple shares at the market price of $1000 per share, costing you $100,000, and then sell them to the option holder at the strike price of $100 for $10,000 = 100 x $100.  In either case, you would show a loss of $90,000 on the share transaction, which would be slightly offset by a $250 credit for the premium you received selling the call.  There is no limit on the potential loss since there is no limit on how high the underlying share price can go. Covered Call Option Consider now the case of a covered call option.  Since you hold the underlying shares, any loss you make on the option position would be \"\"covered\"\" by the profit you make on the underlying shares. Again, suppose you own 100 Apple shares and sell a call option with a strike price of $100 at a premium of $2.50 to earn a payment of $250. If the price of Apple skyrockets to $1000, then there are again two possible scenarios. One, you buy back the option at a premium of about $900 costing you $90,000.  In order to cover this cost you would then sell your 100 Apple shares at the market price of $1000 per share to realise $100,000 = 100 x $1000.  On the other hand, if your option is exercised, then you would deliver your 100 Apple shares to the option holder at the contracted strike price of $100 per share, thus receiving just $10,000 = 100 x $100.  The only \"\"loss\"\" is that you have had to sell your shares for much less than the market price.\""

Making regular monthly or biweekly contributions is imperative so that you catch compounded returns on your investments.

        "answer": "Scrip dividends in the UK are treated as follows: \n\nWhen a company issues additional shares to shareholders instead of a cash dividend, this is referred to as a stock or scrip dividend. The basic tax position under UK law is that when a company makes a bonus issue of shares, no distribution arises, and the bonus issue of shares is not considered income for tax purposes in the hands of the recipient. Therefore, the receipt of scrip dividends in the form of additional shares is not taxable as income. However, once you sell the shares received as a scrip dividend in the market, you may be liable to pay capital gains tax on the profit you make, potentially with the allowance of the annual tax-free capital gains exemption if applicable .\n\nAdditionally, stock dividends are treated as income under CTA10/S1049 and are taxable as savings income pursuant to sections 409 to 414 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (ITTOIA05). The amount of stock dividend income treated for income tax purposes as arising in the tax year is charged under these sections, with the income tax charged on the cash equivalent of the share capital on the issue of which the stock dividend income arises .\n\nFor detailed and specific tax guidance relevant to personal circumstances, it is recommended to consult with a tax professional or refer directly to HMRC guidance.",

            "I wrote about this in another answer: You can sell the scrip dividend in the market; the capital gain from this sale may fall below the annual tax-free allowance for capital gains, in which case you don't pay any capital gains tax on that amount. For a cash dividend, however, there isn't a minimum taxable amount, so you would owe dividend tax on the entire dividend (and may therefore pay more taxes on a cash dividend). Since you haven't sold the shares in the market yet, you haven't earned any income on the shares. You don't owe taxes on the scrip until you sell the shares and earn capital gains on them. HMRC is very explicit about this, in CG33800: It is quite common for a company, particularly a quoted company, to offer its shareholders the option of receiving additional shares instead of a cash dividend. The expression `stock or scrip dividend' is used to describe shares issued in such circumstances. The basic position under tax law is that when a company makes a bonus issue of shares no distribution arises, and the bonus issue of shares is not income for tax purposes in the hands of the recipient.

        "question": "Frequency of investments to maximise returns (and minimise fees)",
        "answer": "The documents suggest that maximising returns and minimising fees can be achieved through various strategies. One key way to grow assets is through regular, continuous deposits such as automatic investing, which can benefit from compounding returns, tax-efficient auto-rebalancing, and reinvesting dividends rather than trying to time the market . This approach may help in avoiding timing risks and could work in favor of investors by reducing the impact of market volatility over time.\n\nAdditionally, investing in low-fee options such as Vanguard's funds, which offer low expense ratios, can help in minimising fees that might erode returns. Using Vanguard's brokerage account to trade ETF versions of their funds commission-free or investing in their mutual funds with long track records of beating the market could be beneficial as well .\n\nInvestors are also advised against high-cost mutual funds that can have higher fees and commissions than index funds or ETFs, as these costs could significantly impact the net returns . It might be wise to consider platforms like Vanguard or Fidelity that offer no-load and no-transaction fee funds with low expenses, as these can be more cost-effective over time compared to options that charge a percentage of assets as fees .\n\nAs investment frequency can affect the potential to maximize returns while minimizing fees, one of the best practices would include making regular contributions to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging and reducing the impact of fees. While the documents do not specify an exact frequency, they emphasize the pattern of regular and disciplined investing as a key to optimizing returns and managing costs.",

            "Okay, I think I managed to find the precise answer to this problem! It involves solving a non-linear exponential equation, but I also found a good approximate solution using the truncated Taylor series. See below for a spreadsheet you can use. Let's start by defining the growth factors per period, for money in the bank and money invested:   Now, let S be the amount ready to be invested after n+1 periods; so the first of that money has earned interest for n periods. That is,  The key step to solve the problem was to fix the total number of periods considered. So let's introduce a new variable: t = the total number of time periods elapsed So if money is ready to invest every n+1 periods, there will be t/(n+1) separate investments, and the future value of the investments will be:  This formula is exact in the case of integer t and n, and a good approximation when t and n are not integers. Substituting S, we get the version of the formula which explicitly depends on n:  Fortunately, only a couple of terms in FV depend on n, so we can find the derivative after some effort:  Equating the derivative to zero, we can remove the denominator, and assuming t is greater than zero, we can divide by the constant ( 1-G t ):  To simplify the equation, we can define some extra constants:    Then, we can define a function f(n) and write the equation as:  Note that \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, G, and R are all constant. From here there are two options: Use Newton's method or another numerical method for finding the positive root of f(n). This can be done in a number of software packages like MATLAB, Octave, etc, or by using a graphics calculator. Solve approximately using a truncated Taylor series polynomial. I will use this method here. The Taylor series of f(n), centred around n=0, is:  Truncating the series to the first three terms, we get a quadratic polynomial (with constant coefficients):  Using R, G, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 defined above, let c0, c1 and c2 be the coefficients of the truncated Taylor series for f(n):    Then,  n should be rounded to the nearest whole number. To be certain, check the values above and below n using the formula for FV. Using the example from the question: For example, I might put aside $100 every week to invest into a stock   with an expected growth of 9% p.a., but brokerage fees are $10/trade.   For how many weeks should I accumulate the $100 before investing, if I   can put it in my high-interest bank account at 4% p.a. until then? Using Newton's method to find roots of f(n) above, we get n = 14.004. Using the closed-form approximate solution, we get n = 14.082. Checking this against the FV with t = 1680 (evenly divisible by each n + 1 tested): Therefore, you should wait for n = 14 periods, keeping that money in the bank, investing it together with the money in the next period (so you will make an investment every 14 + 1 = 15 weeks.) Here's one way to implement the above solution with a spreadsheet. StackExchange doesn't allow tables in their syntax at this time, so I'll show a screenshot of the formulae and columns you can copy and paste: Formulae:  Copy and paste column A: Copy and paste column B: Results:  Remember, n is the number of periods to accumulate money in the bank. So you will want to invest every n+1 weeks; in this case, every 15 weeks.",
            "\"Wow, this turns out to be a much more difficult problem than I thought from first looking at it. Let's recast some of the variables to simplify the equations a bit. Let rb be the growth rate of money in your bank for one period. By \"\"growth rate\"\" I mean the amount you will have after one period. So if the interest rate is 3% per year paid monthly, then the interest for one month is 3/12 of 1% = .25%, so after one month you have 1.0025 times as much money as you started with. Similarly, let si be the growth rate of the investment. Then after you make a deposit the amount you have in the bank is pb = s. After another deposit you've collected interest on the first, so you have pb = s * rb + s. That is, the first deposit with one period's growth plus the second deposit. One more deposit and you have pb = ((s * rb) + s) * rb + s = s + s * rb + s * rb^2. Etc. So after n deposits you have pb = s + s * rb + s * rb^2 + s * rb^3 + ... + s * rb^(n-1). This simplifies to pb = s * (rb^n - 1)/(rb - 1). Similarly for the amount you would get by depositing to the investment, let's call that pi, except you must also subtract the amount of the broker fee, b. So you want to make deposits when pb>pi, or s*(ri^n-1)/(ri-1) - b > s*(rb^n-1)/(rb-1) Then just solve for n and you're done! Except ... maybe someone who's better at algebra than me could solve that for n, but I don't see how to do it. Further complicating this is that banks normally pay interest monthly, while stocks go up or down every day. If a calculation said to withdraw after 3.9 months, it might really be better to wait for 4.0 months to collect one additional month's interest. But let's see if we can approximate. If the growth rates and the number of periods are relatively small, the compounding of growth should also be relatively small. So an approximate solution would be when the difference between the interest rates, times the amount of each deposit, summed over the number of deposits, is greater than the fee. That is, say the investment pays 10% per month more than your bank account (wildly optimistic but just for example), the broker fee is $10, and the amount of each deposit is $200. Then if you delay making the investment by one month you're losing  10% of $200 = $20. This is more than the broker fee, so you should invest immediately. Okay, suppose more realistically that the investment pays 1% more per month than the bank account. Then the first month you're losing 1% of $200 = $2. The second month you have $400 in the bank, so you're losing $4, total loss for two months = $6. The third month you have $600 in the bank so you lose an additional $6, total loss = $12. Etc. So you should transfer the money to the investment about the third month. Compounding would mean that losses on transferring to the investment are a little higher than this, so you'd want to bias to transferring a little earlier. Or, you could set up a spreadsheet to do the compounding calculations month by month, and then just look down the column for when the investment total minus the bank total is greater than the broker fee. Sorry I'm not giving you a definitive answer, but maybe this helps.\""

        "answer": "When considering the purchase of ETFs, especially when other investment avenues are maxed out, there are several factors to take into account:\n\n1. **Accessibility**: Check how easy it is to buy ETFs, whether you have a Demat Account and access to brokers, or if you need to open an additional account which could incur costs .\n\n2. **Comparison of ETFs and Mutual Funds**: ETFs offer advantages like hedging with options, intraday trading, and potentially no transaction fees when brokers offer a suite of ETFs without such fees. However, mutual funds discourage speculative behavior by means of investment limitations and provide the ability to dollar-cost average without transaction costs .\n\n3. **Volume and Spreads**: When comparing two ETFs that track the same index, consider volume and bid-ask spreads, which might matter if you are using options or if you prefer smaller spreads. Higher volume could suggest a better choice due to liquidity and possibly smaller spreads .\n\n4. **Cost and Auto-Investing**: Even though Admiral Shares or similar mutual funds might have lower expense ratios compared to ETFs, the inability to auto-invest in ETFs could be a disadvantage due to their trading like stocks and the need to buy whole shares .\n\n5. **Employment in Financial Industry**: For those who work in finance, mutual funds might be more accessible due to the need for trading permissions that apply to equities and ETFs but not mutual funds .\n\n6. **Brokerage Accounts and Free Trades**: Some brokerage accounts like Wells Fargo offer a number of free trades which can be beneficial if you are planning on purchasing ETFs. Other brokerages may offer other values like technical tools, ACH money management, and after-hours trading .\n\n7. **Taxation**: Be aware of potential taxation issues, such as with a 1031 exchange, which does not apply to ETFs. Selling an index mutual fund to buy an equivalent ETF, consequently incurring taxes, is not recommended .\n\nUltimately, whether or not to invest in ETFs when all other investment opportunities are fully utilized should be based on your individual financial goals, market conditions, and the factors mentioned above. It's advisable to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor if uncertainty persists.",

Buying only $1000 at a time the broker transaction fee will eat too much of your money. You want to keep such fees way down below 0.1%. Pay attention to transaction fees and fund expense ratios.  Or buy an equivalent index fund directly from the mutual fund company. This generally costs nothing in transaction fees if you have at least the minimum account value built up. If you buy every month or two you are dollar cost averaging, no matter what kind of account you are using. Keep doing that, even if the market values are going down.

        "question": "Best way to make most of savings with ISA and Offset mortgage",
        "answer": "To make the most of your savings with an ISA and an Offset mortgage, consider employing a strategic approach like the one detailed in the document. Firstly, the individual placed money into an offset savings account until the mortgage balance was very low \u2014 less than a year's worth of mortgage payments. Then, they arranged monthly transfers from the offset savings pot directly into the mortgage. This action was designed to deplete the offset savings in line with the mortgage debt, bringing the interest on the two nearly to zero and maintaining a consistent margin owed over time. \n\nWith the mortgage being effectively paid off by the high level of offset savings, they directed any spare money into ISA savings, utilizing the liquidity of the mortgage amount while simultaneously building up other savings. This method kept the full liquidity of the mortgage amount, allowing for the withdrawal of all the offset savings if needed. The offset mortgage rate became less relevant since the mortgage was being paid off by keeping the offset savings pot high, effectively balancing out the mortgage interest charge .\n\nThis approach suggests that rather than rapidly paying off the mortgage, you might benefit from maintaining liquidity while building ISA savings. Before implementing a strategy like this, you should consider your financial situation and objectives, and possibly seek advice from a financial advisor to ensure that such an approach would be appropriate for you.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"I am not a Financial Advisor, but I an tell you what I did in exactly this situation - which is pretty much what you are proposing.  I put money into the offset savings account until I had only a small amount of mortgage \"\"balance\"\" left (less than a year's worth of mortgage payments), then I set it up so that each month I did the transfer from the offset savings pot into the mortgage itself. This depleted the offset savings in line with the mortgage debt, and the interest on the two balanced out almost to zero. This was self-sustaining and meant that I kept the same margin owing over time (i.e. if I was in this situation for 5 years, for the whole 5 years I would effectively have 1 year remaining on the mortgage). Meanwhile, since I now didn't have any mortgage outgoings from my regular income, I put any spare money into ISA savings. No need to withdraw money from the mortgage to move to the ISA. The benefits of this (as opposed to just paying off the damn mortgage already) were that I kept the full liquidity of the mortgage amount - I could withdraw all the offset savings pot if I wanted to, although I would then have to have funded the mortgage payments differently, and as that liquidity went down over time I was building up other savings in parallel. It worked well for me. It almost doesn't matter what the offset mortgage rate is since you are effectively paying it off by keeping the offset savings pot so high.\""

        "question": "What does it mean \u201csell on ask\u201d , \u201csell on bid\u201d in stocks?",
        "answer": "In the context of stock trading, \"sell on ask\" and \"sell on bid\" relate to the prices at which a trader can sell their stocks. \n\n\"Sell on ask\" means selling at the ask price, which is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for their shares. When traders \"sell on ask,\" they are essentially agreeing to accept the current asking price that is posted in the market for immediate execution. This can be important when you want to exit a position quickly and are willing to take the current market price.\n\n\"Sell on bid,\" on the other hand, means selling at the bid price, which is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for the shares. This usually implies that sellers are willing to sell at the price buyers are offering, which could lead to a faster transaction but potentially at a lower price than the ask.\n\nThe bid price is always lower than the ask price, and the difference between the two is called the spread. Retail investors typically buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price, whereas market makers do the opposite to profit from the spread.\n\nWhen you sell at market price, your selling order is matched with the highest bid. Conversely, when you buy at market price, your purchase order is matched with the lowest ask price. An order executes only when a bid and an ask meet, which means a buyer's bid equals a seller's asking price.\n\nThese concepts are fundamental in understanding market microstructure and can affect the strategy, especially for traders with a short-term focus such as day traders. For long-term investors, the difference between the bid and ask prices may have less impact, but for those looking to capitalize on short-term movements in the market, the choice between selling on ask or bid can be critical .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Bid and ask prices are the reigning highest buy price and lowest sell price in the market which doesn't mean one must only buy/sell at thise prices. That said one can buy/sell at whatever price they so wish although doing it at any other price than the bid/ask is usually harder as other market participants will gravitate to the reigning bid/ask price. So in theory you can buy at ask and sell at bid, whether or not your order will be filled is another matter altogether.",
            "\"It's good to ask this question, because this is one of the fundamental dichotomies in market microstructure. At any time T for each product on a (typical) exchange there are two well-defined prices: At time T there is literally no person in the market who wants to sell below the ask, so all the people who are waiting to buy at the bid (or below) could very well be waiting there forever.  There's simply no guarantee that any seller will ever want to part with their product for a lesser price than they think it's worth. So if you want to buy the product at time T you have a tough choice to make: you get in line at the bid price, where there's no guarantee that your request will ever be filled, and you might never get your hands on the product you decide that owning the product right now is more valuable to you than (ask - bid) * quantity, so you tell the exchange that you're willing to buy at the ask price, and the exchange matches you with whichever seller is first in line Now, if you're in the market for the long term, the above choice is completely immaterial to you.  Who cares if you pay $10.00 * 1000 shares or $10.01 * 1000 shares when you plan to sell 30 years from now at $200 (or $200.01)? But if you're a day trader or anyone else with a very short time horizon, then this choice is extremely important: if the price is about to go up several cents and you got in line at the bid (and never got filled) then you missed out on some profit if you \"\"cross the spread\"\" to buy at the ask and then the price doesn't go up (or worse, goes down), you're screwed.  In order to get out of the position you'll have to cross the spread again and sell at at most the bid, meaning you've now paid the spread twice (plus transaction fees and regulatory fees) for nothing. (All of the above also applies in reverse for selling at the ask versus selling at the bid, but most people like to learn in terms of buying rather than selling.)\"",
            "\"Honestly, I wonder if the other answerers aren't overthinking it. Their answers are detailed and correct, but what your coach may be saying is this: When you have bought a stock, on cash or margin, and you are watching it rise you are evaluating when you sell on the price of the stock you are seeing. In reality, you should look at the bid (price buyers will give you for the stock) and ask (price sellers will charge you for the stock) prices. If the stock is going up, odds are the price of the stock is very close to the ask price because it is purchases that are driving it up, but that's not what you're going to get when you sell. You're going to get something around the bid price. If the spread between the two is large (i.e. a volatile stock) this could be many cents or more lower than the ask price. Therefore, what your coach may mean by \"\"Selling on Ask\"\" is you're using the stock price when it's equal or close to the ask price to decide when to sell, instead of letting the stock peak and drop (when its price will approach the bid price) or letting the trailing bid offers catch up to your desired sell point and selling then (i.e. letting the stock point grow PAST your sell point, dragging the bid price up with it). Just a thought, but that sounds like a term a coach would come up with to mean selling and getting less than you thought you were going to from the sale.

        "question": "Growth rate plus dividend yieid total?",
        "answer": "The concept you are referring to, \"Growth rate plus dividend yield,\" is typically known as total return in investing terms. Total return accounts for both the capital appreciation (or growth in stock price) and the income received from dividends. The excerpt from the uploaded document states: \"The sum of the dividend yield plus capital growth is called total return. In your examples, you get to a total return of 7% through several different (and theoretically equivalent) paths. That is the right way of thinking\" . \n\nThis is an essential concept for investors because it reflects the actual performance of an investment, considering both the increase in value and the income it generates. Remember that compounding plays a significant role in generating wealth from investments over the long term because any dividends received can be reinvested to purchase more shares, leading to greater total returns over time, assuming you reinvest the dividends every year in new shares. However, it is important to note that taxes and the timing of dividend reinvestments may impact the total return . \n\nWhen calculating the total return for your own investments, be sure to consider your cost basis for the shares, which is the original value of an asset for tax purposes (usually the purchase price), adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and return of capital distributions. This will give you a more accurate picture of your personal total return, as opposed to just looking at the published yield and growth rates which are based on the current share price .",

Well probably not, but if it did then maybe you could call it the same. Even if the dollars are the same the growth rate is more variable than the dividends so its valuable to segregate the two. I am open to criticism, my answer is based on my personal experience and would love to hear contrary positions on this.",

        "question": "When do I sell a stock that I hold as a long-term position?",
        "answer": "When considering the right time to sell a stock that you hold as a long-term position, there are several factors to take into account, each one related to your investment strategy and goals. Here are some pointers outlined in the document you provided:\n\n1. **Reevaluate based on fundamentals**: You should frequently review the stock and ask yourself if you would buy it today based on its current fundamentals and price. If the answer is no, then it may be time to consider selling .\n\n2. **Investment goals and price targets**: Consider whether your initial reasons for investing have changed. You might have had a price target based on a future market cap derived from your analysis at the time of investment. If those targets are met or the company's prospects change, that could be a signal for selling .\n\n3. **Emotional factors and cognitive biases**: Avoid emotional decisions and cognitive biases such as loss aversion or the sunk cost fallacy. Instead, establish clear rules for when to sell based on objective criteria, which can include setting thresholds for losses or gains where you'll exit the investment .\n\n4. **Technical indicators and trends**: If you're adept at reading technical charts, look for signs of uptrends or downtrends. For example, a switch from making higher highs and higher lows (an uptrend) to making lower highs and lower lows could indicate a trend reversal and might be a time to sell .\n\n5. **Diversification and concentration risk**: If your portfolio is heavily concentrated in a few stocks, consider the risk involved in this allocation. If you wouldn't choose to buy the same stocks with new funds based on your current analysis, holding onto them just because you already own them might not be a logical decision .\n\n6. **Tax implications**: If selling might lead to significant tax consequences, it could make sense to sell in increments that align with your tax strategy or to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates .\n\nBefore taking any action, it's important to revisit your investment strategy and the individual circumstances of your holdings to decide the best course of action for your financial objectives.",

The only intelligent advice I can offer is to look at your holdings frequently, and ask, \"\"would I buy this stock today given its fundamentals and price?\"\" If you wouldn't buy it, you shouldn't hold it. (This is in contrast to the company ratings you see of buy, hold, sell. If I should hold it, but you shouldn't buy it to hold, that makes no sense to me.)

Think about it as if you are re-buying the stocks you own every day you decide to keep them and don't set emotional anchor points about what you paid for them or what they might be worth tomorrow. These lead to two major logical fallacies that investor's commonly fall prey to, Loss Aversion and Sunk Cost, both of which can be bad for your portfolio in the long run. To avert these natural tendencies, I suggest having a game plan before you purchase a stock based on on your investment goals for that stock. For example a combination of one or more of the following: I'm investing for the long term and I expect this stock to appreciate and will hold it until (specific event/time) at which point I will (sell it all/sell it gradually over a fixed time period) right around the time I need the money. I'm going to bail on this stock if it falls more than X % from my purchase price. I'm going to cash out (all/half/some) of this investment if it gains more than x % from my purchase price to lock in my returns. The important thing is to arrive at a strategy before you are invested and are likely to be more emotional than rational.  Otherwise, it can be very hard to sell a \"\"hot\"\" stock that has suddenly jumped in price 25% because \"\"it has momentum\"\" (gambler's fallacy). Conversely it can be hard to sell a stock when it drops by 25% because \"\"I know it will bounce back eventually\"\" (Sunk Cost/Loss Aversion Fallacy).  Also, remember that there is opportunity cost from sticking with a losing investment because your brain is saying \"\"I really haven't lost money until I give up and sell it.\"\" When logically you should be thinking, \"\"If I move my money to a more promising investment I could get a better return than I am likely to on what I'm holding.\"\"\"",
            "For what it's worth -- and I realize this isn't directly an answer to the question -- one of the advantages of sticking with mutual funds, beyond their being inherently diversified, is that it removes a lot of the temptation to try to time the market. When you need money, you sell shares in such a way that it maintains your preferred investment ratio, and simply don't worry about which stocks are  actually involved.

Class A shares typically trade at a higher value than Class C shares because they come with voting rights. A settlement arrangement outlined in Google's case indicates that if the price of C shares diverges from the price of A shares by a certain percentage after one year from the issuance of the Class C shares, Google would pay the difference based on a set scale. For example, if the C share price is 4.5% less than the A share price, then a certain settlement payment is calculated to compensate for that discrepancy .\n\nThe specific details of voting rights for Class B shares are also mentioned. Class B shares have one voting right, which is distinct from Class A shares, which have more voting power and thus trade at a higher value .\n\nIn this context, A-B-C class shares refer to different classes of stock that a company can offer, each with different rights and values:\n\n- Class A shares generally have voting rights and might trade at a higher price because of the influence they confer to their holders on company decisions.\n- Class B shares, in this particular document, are noted to have one voting right per share.\n- Class C shares are typically non-voting shares and might trade at a lower price compared to Class A due to the lack of voting power.\n\nThese distinctions are important for investors to consider, as they can affect both the value of the shares and the level of control an investor has within the company. The document does not explicitly state Class B's trade value in comparison to Class A, but it does imply that Class A trades at a higher value than Class B, which is consistent with the general understanding that greater voting power results in a higher share value.",

        "answer": "Penny stocks can experience significant increases in value for a number of reasons. According to the document, one explanation for a penny stock's price increase is a short squeeze. A short squeeze happens when a stock with high short interest (i.e., many shares sold short) experiences a price increase, which then triggers stops and margin calls. This can force short sellers to cover their positions and buy back the stock at the higher prices, thereby pushing the price up even further.\n\nShort selling does not inherently lower the stock price more than any regular selling does. It involves borrowing shares from another investor's margin and then selling them with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price to pocket the difference. As long as the short selling is not \"naked,\" meaning it does not result in a failure to deliver (FTD), it does not add artificial selling pressure to the market.\n\nThe cascade effect from covering shorts can induce a more significant rally in the stock's price than if there was no short interest at all. It's interesting to note that many investors view a high short interest as a potential bullish signal, suggesting that they anticipate potential upward pressure on the stock price from a short squeeze.",

        "question": "Tax on Stocks or ETF's",
        "answer": "When it comes to taxes on stocks or ETFs, there are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. Capital Gains and Losses: When you invest in stocks or mutual funds, you don't have to declare anything to the IRS regarding the changes in the share price, neither the paper gains nor the paper losses. However, when you sell your shares, you will have a capital gain or loss, which will be taxed or deducted .\n\n2. Distributions and Dividends: The profits made by a mutual fund from buying and selling stocks are distributed to its shareholders, and those capital gain distributions are taxable income that must be reported on your tax return, even if you reinvest them in more shares of the same mutual fund. Similarly, dividends paid by the stocks owned by the mutual fund are also taxable income .\n\n3. Estimated Tax and Withholding: If your taxable income increases, for example, due to selling stocks in a taxable account or withdrawing funds from an IRA, and that increase is not adequately covered by withholding, you may owe estimated tax. The IRS doesn't bill you quarterly for estimated tax based on your activity; it's your responsibility to figure out if you need to pay estimated tax and do so to avoid penalties .\n\n4. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Capital Gains Tax: The United States taxes long-term capital gains at lower rates compared to ordinary tax rates. Short-term capital gains, on the other hand, are taxed as ordinary income at your marginal tax bracket. For example, if you're in the 25% tax bracket, your short-term gains will be taxed at that rate. On the other hand, long-term capital gains would be subject to lower tax rates .\n\nIt's important to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor for personalized advice, as the above information is general in nature and may not pertain to your specific financial situation.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"If you sell a stock, with no distributions, then your gain is taxable under \u00a71001.  But not all realized gains will be recognized as taxable.  And some gains which are arguably not realized, will be recognized as taxable. The stock is usually a capital asset for investors, who will generate capital gains under \u00a71(h), but dealers, traders, and hedgers will get different treatment.  If you are an investor, and you held the stock for a year or more, then you can get the beneficial capital gain rates (e.g. 20% instead of 39.6%).  If the asset was held short-term, less than a year, then your tax will generally be calculated at the higher ordinary income rates.  There is also the problem of the net investment tax under \u00a71411.  I am eliding many exceptions, qualifications, and permutations of these rules. If you receive a \u00a7316 dividend from a stock, then that is \u00a761 income.  Qualified dividends are ordinary income but will generally be taxed at capital gains rates under \u00a71(h)(11).  Distributions in redemption of your stock are usually treated as sales of stock.  Non-dividend distributions (that are not redemptions) will reduce your basis in the stock to zero (no tax due) and past zero will be treated as gain from a sale. If you exchange stock in a tax-free reorganization (i.e. contribute your company stock in exchange for an acquirer's stock), you have what would normally be considered a realized gain on the exchange, but the differential will not be recognized, if done correctly. If you hold your shares and never sell them, but you engage in other dealings (short sales, options, collars, wash sales, etc.) that impact those shares, then you can sometimes be deemed to have recognized gain on shares that were never sold or exchanged. A more fundamental principle of income tax design is that not all realized gains will be recognized.  IRC \u00a71001(c) says that all realized gains are recognized, except as otherwise provided; that \"\"otherwise\"\" is substantial and far-ranging.\"",

        "question": "Income in zero-interest environment",
        "answer": "In a zero-interest environment, banks and financial institutions have devised certain methods to still make money despite the challenge of not charging traditional interest on loans. These methods include:\n\n1. Charging actual loan fees on \"0%\" loans, which are often presented to credit card holders as balance transfer checks. These fees typically amount to 2-3% or carry a minimum floor amount, rendering the effective interest rate higher than the nominal 0% if the loan is paid off within the stipulated 0% interest period .\n\n2. Collaborating with asset dealers such as car, boat, and RV dealers to arrange financing for customers. Dealers may pay the interest to finance companies so that a 0% loan can be offered to the retail customer for a part or all of the loan term. The loans are usually secured by the asset being purchased, which is also insured, ensuring that the lenders do not lose money even if the customer defaults .\n\n3. Incorporating the actual interest into the sale price of an item while offering a loan to pay for it at a nominal 0% interest rate. This way, even if the borrower pays off the loan early, they still end up paying all the interest, as the full cost has been baked into the sale price .\n\nAdditionally, in the current economic climate with low, and sometimes negative, interest rates, investment alternatives such as corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide better returns than traditional savings, albeit with different risk profiles that must be understood by the investor .\n\nFor individual savers and investors, it is crucial to be aware of the fees, terms, and conditions of financial products, especially in a low or zero-interest-rate economy. It is recommended to fully understand the risks involved with any financial product and avoid those that are not completely clear .",

        "answer": "The buy and sell prices you see on the stock exchange represent two different things:\n\n1. **Buy (Bid) Price**: This is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a stock. It represents a buyer's interest in purchasing stock at that price.\n\n2. **Sell (Ask/Offer) Price**: This is the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell their stock. It represents a seller's willingness to part with their stock for at least that price.\n\nWhen a trade occurs, it means that a buyer has agreed to purchase the stock at the same price that a seller has agreed to sell their stock. The buy price will always be slightly lower than the sell price because of the spread, which is the difference between these two prices.

        "question": "Can the beta of a stock be used as a lagging indicator for the stock w.r.t the market",
        "answer": "Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. A stock with a beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the market, while a stock with a beta less than 1 is less volatile. It's important to note that beta is not a lag in time but a measure of the average size of a move in the stock at the same time as a move in the index. This means that beta indicates how much a stock's price might move in relation to market movements, but it does not inherently indicate anything about the timing of those moves .\n\nBeta is calculated based on historical data and reflects past volatility, so in that sense, it is not a predictive indicator; rather, it's reflective of historical performance. While beta might seem to indicate that a stock lags the market due to its smaller magnitude of movement (for betas less than 1), this is not a lag in time, simply a lower responsiveness to market movements .\n\nTherefore, beta cannot be used as a lagging indicator in the sense of providing insights into the future performance of a stock with respect to the market; it's more of a measure of relative risk or volatility that has been observed in the past. If you\u2019re considering using beta as part of an investment strategy, it would generally be in the context of assessing risk and portfolio diversification rather than predicting future market movements.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Just to be clear to start, beta is a statistical property.  So if your beta is 0.8 over a period of time.  Stock X moved on average 0.8 for a point move in the index. We might hope this property is persistent and it seems to be fairly persistent (predictable) but it doesn't have to be. Also it is important to note this is not a lag in time.  Beta is a measure of the average size of a move in the stock at the same time as a move in the index.  In your example both the stock and index are measured at end of day.  You can say that the stock \"\"lags\"\" behind the index because it doesn't grow as quickly as the market when the market is growing, but this is not a lag in time just a lag in magnitude.   People do occasionally calculate betas between a stock and lagged in time market prices, but this is not the commonly used meaning of beta.  This might actually be a more useful measure as then you could bet on the future of the stock given what happened today in the market, but these \"\"betas\"\" tend to be much more unstable than the synchronized version and hard to trade on. When you calculated beta you choose a time scale, in this case daily.  So if your calculation is on a day-to-day basis then you have only tested the relationship on a day-to-day basis not, for instance, on a week-to-week basis.  Now day-to-day and week-to-week betas are often related and are generally reasonably close but they do not have to be.  There can be longer term effects only picked up on the longer scale.   Stock X could day-to-day with a (average) beta of 1 to the stock market, but could have even a negative beta year-to-year with the market if the stock is counter-cyclical to longer scale trends on the market.  So beta can change with the time scale used in the calculation.\"",
            "The beta of a stock can be interpreted as the average relative movement of a stock with respect to the movement of a market index. In your case, the stock will move on average by 0.8. Thus over a longer time horizon, not on a daily, weekly basis."

        "question": "Why do put option prices go higher when the underlying stock tanks (drops)?",
        "answer": "Put option prices tend to go higher when the underlying stock drops because options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and are priced based on several factors, including the asset's volatility. According to the Black-Scholes model, which is a common pricing model for options, higher volatility or the expectation of higher volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset. In response to this increased risk, call options (which give the right to buy the stock at a specified price) are priced lower, and put options (which give the right to sell the stock at a specified price) are priced higher. Therefore, if a stock is expected to go down or is actually going down, the market perceives it as more volatile or at higher risk of further decline, which in turn raises the price of its put options.",

            "\"There are two components of option valuation, the value that's \"\"in the money\"\" and the \"\"time value.\"\" In the case of the $395 put, that option was already in the money and it will move less than the stock price by a bit as there will still be some time value there. $22.52 is intrinsic value (the right word for 'in the money') and the rest is time. The $365 strike is still out of the money, but as jldugger implied, the chance of it going through that strike is better as it's $6.66 closer.  Looking at the options chain gives you a better perspective on this. If Apple went up $20 Monday, and down $20 Tuesday, these prices would be higher as implied volatility would also go higher.  Now, I'd hardly call a drop of under 2% \"\"tanking\"\" but on the otherhand, I'd not call the 25% jump in the option price skyrocketing. Options do this all the time.

(This assumes that F>(M+P). P is fixed, but the smaller M gets, the larger the term F-(M+P), and therefore the higher your potential profit from owning the put. So when M \"\"tanks,\"\" the put goes higher.  The $395 put is already in the money. If it were settled today, the value would be $395-$376 or $19. This, minus the cost of the put itself, represents your profit. The $365 put is \"\"out of the money.\"\" The stock has to fall $11 more before the put is exercised. But if the stock went down 8 points today, that is less than the $19 difference at the start of the day.

            "Options pricing is based on the gap between strike and the current market, and volatility. That's why the VIX, a commonly accepted volatility index, is actually just a weighted blend of S&P 500 future options prices.  A general rise in the price of options indicates people don't know whether it will go up or down next, and are therefore less willing to take that risk.  But your question is why everything underwater in the puts chain went higher, and that's simple: now that Apple's down, the probability of falling a few more points is higher. Especially since Apple has gone through some recent rough times, and stocks in general are seen as risky these days."

        "answer": "The decision to sell ESPP stock depends on a number of factors including the specific terms of your ESPP, your financial goals, tax considerations, and the stock's performance. However, the document suggests that if there is no required holding period for the ESPP, selling right away can be like receiving a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk. It also mentions that you should be cautious around the time your company may issue an earnings report, as a bad report could decrease the stock value, potentially eliminating the benefit of the discount received through the ESPP .\n\nMoreover, there is a point raised about immediate selling being beneficial as being employed by the company could already represent a significant investment in that company's success, so holding additional investment might not be ideal. Another consideration mentioned is the tax implications, as the tax rate can depend on how long the stock is held; selling immediately can complicate your taxes a bit since the discount is typically taxed as income, with any gains or losses due to price fluctuations from the time of purchase to the time of selling being considered as capital gains or losses .\n\nPlease, review the terms of your ESPP and consider your personal financial situation as well as market conditions. If the stock is volatile, you may want to wait until you feel the stock has reached a price you're satisfied with before selling, but be mindful of any upcoming company events or reports that could affect stock prices.

Here are a couple other considerations: Tax implications: When you sell the stock, you have to pay taxes on the profit (including that 15% discount). The tax rate you pay is based on how long you wait to sell it. If you wait a certain amount of time (usually 2 years, but it will depend on your specific tax codes) before you sell, you could be subject to lower tax rates on that profit. See here for a more detailed description. This might only apply if you're in the US. Since you work for the company, you may be privy to a bit more information about how the company is run and how likely it is to grow. As such, if you feel like the company is headed in the right direction, you may want to hold on the the stock for a while.  I am generally wary of being significantly invested in the company you work for. If the company goes south, then the stock price will obviously drop, but you'll also be at risk to be laid off. As such you're exposed much more risk than investing in other companies.

If the company runs the program out of treasury stock (shares that are authorized, but not issued), then there aren't any shares being purchased on the open market.

If you look in your employer's annual report, you will probably find how the program is run and how many shares are issued annually under that program. By comparing that to the daily trading volume of the company's stock you can gauge whether there's any likelihood of the share price being affected by the employee purchases. That is, of course, if shares are being purchased on the open market.

This describes an instance of the employee purchase program being run from unissued stock, not open market purchases. From it, we can tell 18,555 shares were issued during the past fiscal year.

The outcomes can vary depending on the specific terms of the stock grant and the nature of the acquisition. Generally, there are two common scenarios that could occur:\n\n1. Immediate vesting of all units: This scenario often applies to RSUs or options granted to executives or key employees. Immediate vesting can be triggered by a provision known as Change in/of Control (CIC or COC) included in the grant documentation. Other instances for immediate vesting may occur if a key employee is terminated without cause or dies. The terms and conditions of such provisions are usually detailed in the grant documentation and may have been negotiated at the time of the grant.\n\n2. Conversion of the units to a new schedule: For more typical employee-level grants, it's common for RSUs or option grants to be converted at the deal price to a new schedule with the same vesting dates and percentages. However, the new schedule may include a different number of units and a different dollar amount or strike price. The intention is generally to leave the employees in a similar position as they would have been before the deal.\n\nThere may also be situations where the options are replaced with equivalent options in the acquiring company, with adjustments made to the number of shares and the strike price, reflecting the rate at which the actual stock was converted, while keeping the vesting terms essentially the same.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the specific actions taken with respect to unvested stock during an acquisition should be outlined in the grant documentation received when the restricted stock was initially granted .",

Instead, they offer investments like money market funds, where the money is held by the fund\u2014not by the 401(k) administrator\u2014and these funds are designed to be as close to cash as possible without being actual money on their balance sheets.\n\nIf you are looking for something that behaves as cash within your 401(k), you should consider money market funds or short-term bond funds.

Cash, though it will retain its principle over time, will always be subject to inflation risk (assuming a positive-inflation environment which, historically in the US anyway, has always been the case since the Great Depression). But I couldn't find a \"\"Pure Cash - No investment option\"\" - what I mean by this is an option where my money is kept idle without investing in any kind of financial instrument (stocks, bonds, other MFs, currencies, forex etc etc whatever).  Getting back to the real crux of your question, several other answers have already highlighted that you're looking for a money market fund.  These will likely be as close to cash as you will get in a retirement account for the reasons listed in @KentA's answer. Investing in short-term notes would also be another relatively low-risk alternative to a money market fund.  Again, this is low-risk, not no-risk. I wanted such kinda option because things may turn bad and I may want nothing invested in the stock markets/bond markets. I was thinking that if the market turns bear then I would move everything to cash Unless you have a the innate ability to perfectly time the market, you are better off keeping your investments where they are and riding out the bear market.  Cash does not generate dividends - most funds in a retirement account do.  Sure, you may have a paper loss of principle in a bear market, but this will go away once the market turns bull again.  Assuming you have a fairly long time before you retire, this should not concern you in the slightest. Again, I want to stress that market timing does not work.  Even the professionals, who get paid the big bucks to do this, on average, get it right as often as they get it wrong.  If you had this ability, you would not be asking financial questions on Stack Exchange, I can tell you that. I would recommend you read The Four Pillars of Investing, by William Bernstein.  He has a very no-nonsense approach to investing and retirement that would serve you (or anybody) well in turbulent financial markets.

One respondent mentioned an alternative of stopping contributing to a 401k and depositing money in a bank, but that is not the same as cash either.  In recent decades, people have been led to believe that depositing your money in the bank means you hold that in cash at the bank.  That is untrue.  They hold your deposit on their books and proceed to invest/loan that money, but those investments can turn sour in an economic and financial downturn.  The same financial professionals would then remind you that, while this is true, there is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that will make you whole should the bank go under.  Unfortunately, if enough banks went under due to lack of reserves, the FDIC may be unable to make depositors whole for lack of reserves.  In fact, they were nearing this during the last financial crisis.  The sad thing is that the financial industry is bias against offering what you said, because they make money by using your money.  Fractional reserve banking.  You are essentially holding IOUs from your bank when you have money on deposit with them. Getting back to the original question; you could do some searching and see if there is an institution that would act as a cash depository for physical cash in your IRA.  There are IRA-approved ways of holding physical precious metals, which isn't all too different of a concept from holding physical cash. 401k plans are chosen by your company and often have very limited options available, meaning it'd be unlikely you could ever hold physical cash or physical precious metals in your 401k.\"",

        "question": "When to sell a stock?",
        "answer": "When deciding whether to sell a stock, there are several strategies and thought processes to consider. Here are some key points:\n\n1. Regular Evaluation:\n   - Look at your holdings frequently and ask yourself if you would buy the same stock today given its fundamentals and price. If you wouldn't buy it, you might not want to hold it either .\n\n2. Investment Reasons:\n   - Consider your reasons for investing in the company in the first place. If your fundamental reasons for investing have changed, this might be a cue to sell .\n\n3. Pre-set Strategy:\n   - Have a pre-defined strategy for when you will sell a stock, such as a target return percentage or a drop in stock price beyond a certain threshold. It's important to decide on these criteria before buying the stock when emotions are less likely to interfere .\n\n4. Reassessment of Value:\n   - When you're looking at a stock, ask yourself if you'd buy more at today's price. If not, it may be time to sell at least some of that position .\n\n5. Keeping a Diary:\n   - Document your reasons for buying a stock and set conditions for when you would sell it. This can help keep your strategy objective and decrease the impact of emotions on decision-making .\n\n6. Market and Profitability Analysis:\n   - Base your decision on your understanding of the stock's current profitability and prospects as well as market trends. Consider whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time .\n\n7. Avoid Emotional Decisions:\n   - Try to overcome common logical fallacies like Loss Aversion and Sunk Cost which can harm your portfolio in the long run. An emotion-driven decision might prevent you from selling when logical analysis would suggest it\u2019s the best course of action .\n\n8. Opportunity Cost:\n   - Be mindful of the opportunity cost of sticking with a losing investment. Sometimes moving your money to a more promising investment could yield better returns than holding onto a stock that\u2019s not performing well .\n\nIt's crucial to note that these are general strategies and might not be suitable for all investors or investment situations.

Moreover, investing with a long-term perspective is emphasized, as no matter when equities are purchased, they almost always outperform cash and bonds over a long enough time horizon .\n\nIt's noted that it's tough to lose money if investments are held for a long period, and the optimal primary strategy seems to still be buy and hold . Additionally, the concept of \"buy on dip\" is supported by the idea that during downturns, buying regularly through dollar-cost averaging allows investors to automatically buy more when the stock or fund price is lower, which can be advantageous without missing out on potential gains when prices are higher .\n\nAs the market's valuation of stocks is based on the collective expectations of future earnings, someone suggesting buying on a dip might do so with the belief that the market has overreacted to the negative earnings and that the price will recover as the company's prospects improve over time. Nevertheless, it's crucial to remember that the stock price at any given moment represents the balance of upward and downward pressure based on what participants in the market perceive as the expected future value of the stock .\n\nUltimately, the decision to buy on a dip after earnings fail to meet expectations should be based on an investor's own research, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and investment strategy. The information from the document highlights the importance of a diversified, long-term approach, and suggests that trying to time the market perfectly is usually not as effective as consistent investment strategies like dollar-cost averaging and buy-and-hold, especially for non-professional investors.",

Some important aspects highlighted in the file are:\n\n- Investors may have different levels of risk aversion, leading them to prefer different asset allocations. For instance, a risk-averse investor might allocate funds into a diversified portfolio and a cash account to reduce potential loss, while a less risk-averse investor might focus more on high-growth assets, accepting higher risk for potentially higher returns .\n\n- The risk an investor perceives in a given investment can also be influenced by their unique knowledge or expertise. For example, someone with technical expertise in a specific industry may be able to assess the risk of investing in a related company more accurately than general investors or even professional analysts. This local knowledge can give them an edge in determining both the potential and the risk associated with an investment .\n\n- The markets are not perfectly information-efficient, which can lead to stocks being undervalued or overvalued. Different investors may analyze and value stocks differently based on the information used and their method of analysis. Consequently, this leads to variations in perceived risk among investors .\n\nThe selection includes excerpts from a document that seems to discuss various aspects of investing and risks associated with it, even though a direct answer to the question is not quoted.

Hence, in a perfect market it doesn't matter whether you have a stop loss order at $9.00. That just trades your stock worth $9 for cash worth the same $9. In an imperfect market, that trade nets you less. Furthermore, is risk a linear function of money? Perhaps not, if you bought on margin, need to lend extra and your interest rate increases with the extra credit demand.",
            "Capping the upside while playing with unlimited downside is a less disciplined investment strategy vis-a-vis a stop-loss driven strategy. Whether it is less risky or high risky also depends on the fluctuations of the stock and not just long-term movements. For example, your stop losses might get triggered because of a momentary sharp decline in stock price due to a large volume transaction (esp more so in small-cap stocks). Although, the stock price might recover from the sudden price drop pretty soon causing a seemingly preventable loss. That being said, playing with stop losses is always considered a safer strategy.

Unwind the position now, while there is still some remaining value in those call options, and take a short-term loss. Or, you could try this.  Let's say you own an exchange traded call option on a listed stock (very general case). I don't know how much time remains before the option's expiration date. Be that as it may, I could suggest this to effect a \"\"recovery\"\".  You'll be long the call and short the stock. This is called a delta hedge, as you would be delta trading the stock. Delta refers to short-term price volatility.  In other words, you'll short a single large block of the stock, then buy shares, in small increments, whenever the market drops slightly, on an intra-day basis. When the market price of the stock rises incrementally, you'll sell a few shares. Back and forth, in response to short-term market price moves, while maintaining a static \"\"hedge ratio\"\".

If you exercise ISOs and sell them at the Fair Market Value (FMV), you will face specific tax consequences, which can be separated into two categories:\n\n1. **Short-term Capital Gains Tax**: If you exercise your options and immediately sell the shares at FMV, the profit from this transaction will be taxed as short-term capital gains. This is the difference between the selling price and the strike price of your options, multiplied by the number of shares sold.\n\n2. **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)**: Exercising ISOs can subject you to AMT, which is a parallel tax system with its own set of rules. The amount by which the FMV of the shares at the time of exercise exceeds the strike price is considered income for AMT purposes, and this occurs even if you do not sell the shares.\n\nIn the provided context, if you exercise 7,500 shares and sell them back at FMV, your proceeds would be enough to exercise the remaining 12,500 options. Tax implications, in this case, would be seen in short-term capital gains amounting to the profit of the initial batch of shares sold, and AMT income based on the profit of the remaining shares exercised, assuming no immediate sale occurs within the calendar year .\n\nPlease note that taxation rules related to stock options can be complex, and it is recommended that you consult with a tax professional to understand the specific implications for your individual situation. The above information is a broad overview and may not include all the nuances of your tax scenario.\n\nMoreover, the general advice with stock options is often to wait until expiration before exercising them, although there are exceptions based on several factors, which again underscores the importance of getting personalized advice from a qualified tax advisor or financial planner .",

However, what is not weird is the way income tax works, you are taxed on your income in the US.   I assume you are talking about the US here.

In this case if you exercise 7500 shares and sell them back at FMV, your proceeds would be 7500 x $5 = $37,500, with which you could exercise the remaining 12,500 options. The tax implications would be (1) short-term capital gains of 7500 x ($5 - $3) = $15,000 and (2) AMT income of 12,500 x ($5 - $3) = $25,000, assuming you don't sell the shares within the calendar year."

        "answer": "The answer to whether it is best to exercise options shares when they vest or wait depends on several factors, including tax implications, your financial situation, and the specific terms of your employee stock option plan.\n\n**Tax implications**: \nWhen you exercise options, you are typically taxed on the difference between the exercise price and the current market price.

This is because the value of the options could continue to increase. However, there are exceptions to this rule, particularly if there are compelling reasons to exercise early, such as a significant appreciation of the stock price or to diversify one's investment portfolio .\n\n**Personal Financial Situation**: \nYour personal financial situation can also greatly influence the decision. If a large portion of your net worth is invested in your company, and you have other financial liabilities such as student loans or lack a diversified investment portfolio, it may be prudent to exercise some of your options to improve your financial situation. Conversely, if you are financially secure, have a diversified portfolio, and no debt, you may choose to wait and potentially benefit from further appreciation of your company's stock .\n\nRemember to consider the specific details of your stock options and your personal financial goals. It is often recommended to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice taking into account your entire financial picture and the tax implications of your decision.",

            "The general rule with stock options is that it's best to wait until expiration to exercise them.  The rationale depends on a few factors and there are exceptions. Reasons to wait: There would be cases to exercise early: Tax implications should be checked with a professional advisor specific to your situation. In the employee stock option plans that I have personally seen, you get regular income tax assessed between exercise price and current price at the time you exercise.  Your tax basis is then set to the current price.  You also pay capital gains tax when you eventually sell, which will be long or short term based on the time that you held the stock. (The time that you held the options does not count.)  I believe that other plans may be set up differently.",
            "To me it depends on things like your net worth, debt, and how other assets are invested.   Currently you have 25K invested in the company you work for.   If you have 100K in student loans, are a renter, and 12K in your 401K, then I would recommend exercising almost all of your options.  In that case you have a much to large part of your world wrapped up in your company. If you have 250K in your 401K, own a home and have an emergency fund with no debt then you are fine with letting it ride.  You can afford to absorb a loss of 25K without wrecking your net worth. More than likely, you are somewhere in between (just statistics speaking there).  So why not exercise some of them now with the purpose of improving your financial situation?  Say do a 1/3 now and when they come available.   When 401ks were first invented people put almost all of their money in their company stock.  They lost just about everything when the company went down in value and were often a victim of layoffs exasperating the issue.  This is akin to the same situation.  Most financial advisers recommend against putting any 401K money to company stock, or at least limiting the amount."

        "question": "Is there any flaw in this investment scheme?",
        "answer": "The document discusses several issues and potential flaws with the presented investment scheme. Here are some key concerns:\n\n1. **Time Frame and Risk**: The investment scheme suggests a one-year investment horizon which would necessitate fund managers to engage in ultra-conservative, low-volatility investments. This is to ensure they do not take on excessive risk and potentially lose significant capital, as could happen in a market downturn similar to that of 2008 in the US stock market .\n\n2. **Fund Manager Constraints**: The document points out that fund managers, overall, do not have more personal wealth than the collective investments of their clients. Therefore, it is unrealistic for them to underwrite 50% of potential losses. Any such promises would be unsecured and not feasible for the fund managers to honor. It's mentioned that even Warren Buffet does not engage in such a practice with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, despite owning a significant share of it .\n\n3. **Economic Viability**: The scheme describes a situation where the fund manager could place some amount of the investment in ultra-safe holdings to offset potential losses. However, this approach would essentially halve any profits for the investor and only appears viable if trivial proportions like 0.0001% were used, which would not be appealing to most investors. Moreover, keeping such a significant amount in cash (e.g., 50%) would be an inefficient use of capital and not typically accepted by investors .\n\n4. **Cost and Profitability Concerns**: If investment houses were to offer shared investment risk to retail investors, it would require significant capital and could potentially lower their profits due to the necessity of arranging large hedges against market downturns. This would add complexity and risk, such as counter-party risk, and is not generally how investment houses operate .\n\n5. **Legal and Contractual Implications**: The document also touches upon private Forex traders who take responsibility for a share of both the wins and losses of the accounts they manage for clients. While this is an example of shared risk, it is noted that such arrangements are rare, require a high level of trust, and come with significant legal and contractual implications .\n\n6. **Model's Impact on the Investor and Fund Manager**: The model suggests a contract where the investor would receive either half the profits or would bear only half the losses. However, if the worst-case scenario occurs, with all the capital being lost, the fund manager would not only fail to make a profit but would also incur a deficit due to covering half of the loss. This raises questions regarding the sustainability and fairness of the scheme .\n\nThese points highlight that the investment scheme can be flawed in terms of unrealistic expectations from fund managers, inefficient capital usage, and it may not be viable or attractive for savvy investors and fund managers alike.",

            "\"You didn't win in case B. Borrowing shares and then selling them is known as \"\"selling short\"\".  You received $2000 when you sold short 100 shares at $20.  You spent $1000 to buy them back at $10, so you come out $1000 ahead on that deal.  But at the same time, the 100 shares you already owned have declined in value from $20 to $10, so you are down $1000 on that deal.  So you've simply broken even, and you are still out the interest and transaction fees. In effect, a short sale allows you to sell shares you don't own.  But if you do already own them, then the effect is the same as if you just sold your own shares.  This makes it easier to see that this is just a complicated and expensive way of accomplishing nothing at all.\"",
            "\"The process of borrowing shares and selling them is called shorting a stock, or \"\"going short.\"\"  When you use money to buy shares, it is called \"\"going long.\"\" In general, your strategy of going long and short in the same stock in the same amounts does not gain you anything.  Let's look at your two scenarios to see why. When you start, LOOT is trading at $20 per share.  You purchased 100 shares for $2000, and you borrowed and sold 100 shares for $2000.  You are both long and short in the stock for $2000.  At this point, you have invested $2000, and you got your $2000 back from the short proceeds.  You own and owe 100 shares. Under scenario A, the price goes up to $30 per share.  Your long shares have gone up in value by $1000.  However, you have lost $1000 on your short shares.  Your short is called, and you return your 100 shares, and have to pay interest.  Under this scenario, after it is all done, you have lost whatever the interest charges are. Under scenario B, the prices goes down to $10 per share.  Your long shares have lost $1000 in value.  However, your short has gained $1000 in value, because you can buy the 100 shares for only $1000 and return them, and you are left with the $1000 out of the $2000 you got when you first sold the shorted shares.  However, because your long shares have lost $1000, you still haven't gained anything.  Here again, you have lost whatever the interest charges are. As explained in the Traders Exclusive article that @RonJohn posted in the comments, there are investors that go long and short on the same stock at the same time.  However, this might be done if the investor believes that the stock will go down in a short-term time frame, but up in the long-term time frame.  The investor might buy and hold for the long term, but go short for a brief time while holding the long position. However, that is not what you are suggesting.  Your proposal makes no prediction on what the stock might do in different periods of time.  You are only attempting to hedge your bets.  And it doesn't work.  A long position and a short position are opposites to each other, and no matter which way the stock moves, you'll lose the same amount with one position that you have gained in the other position.  And you'll be out the interest charges from the borrowed shares every time. With your comment, you have stated that your scenario is that you believe that the stock will go up long term, but you also believe that the stock is at a short-term peak and will drop in the near future.  This, however, doesn't really change things much.  Let's look again at your possible scenarios. You believe that the stock is a long-term buy, but for some reason you are guessing that the stock will drop in the short-term.  Under scenario A, you were incorrect about your short-term guess.  And, although you might have been correct about the long-term prospects, you have missed this gain.  You are out the interest charges, and if you still think the stock is headed up over the long term, you'll need to buy back in at a higher price. Under scenario B, it turns out that you were correct about the short-term drop.  You pocket some cash, but there is no guarantee that the stock will rise anytime soon.  Your investment has lost value, and the gain that you made with your short is still tied up in stocks that are currently down. Your strategy does prevent the possibility of the unlimited loss inherent in the short.  However, it also prevents the possibility of the unlimited gain inherent in the long position.    And this is a shame, since you fundamentally believe that the stock is undervalued and is headed up.  You are sabotaging your long-term gains for a chance at a small short-term gain.\""

        "question": "Why is early exercise generally not recommended for an in-the-money option?",
        "answer": "Early exercise of an in-the-money option is generally not recommended because the time value inherent in the option premium is lost upon doing so. When you exercise an option early, you forgo the remaining time value that the option could have captured if it were held or sold instead of exercised. For call options on assets that do not pay dividends, the loss of the time value means that it is always better to sell the option at market value than to exercise it early. This is because the market value of the option includes both the intrinsic value and the time value, while early exercise yields only the intrinsic value, which is the difference between the stock price and the strike price.\n\nThe only circumstance under which early exercise might be considered is when an option is so deeply in-the-money that the remaining time value is negligible, and there is an upcoming ex-dividend date for the underlying stock. In such cases, early exercise allows the investor to capture the dividend, and this benefit may outweigh the slight loss of time value due to early exercise . \n\nHowever, for most scenarios, especially for options on non-dividend-paying assets, the value gained by selling the option or holding it to expiry is typically greater than the value obtained through early exercise because of the importance of the time premium component of the option's value. This is demonstrated by Put-Call Parity, which shows that the actual value of the call option if sold (or held) is higher than if exercised early, when considering the present value of the strike price and the current market value of the corresponding put option .\n\nTherefore, except in specific situations like the aforementioned dividend capture strategy, exercising in-the-money options early is usually not advisable due to the unnecessary forfeiture of the option's time value.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Investopedia states: While early exercise is generally not advisable, because the time   value inherent in the option premium is lost upon doing so, there are   certain circumstances under which early exercise may be advantageous.   For example, an investor may choose to exercise a call option that is   deeply in-the-money (such an option will have negligible time value)   just before the ex-dividend date of the underlying stock. This will   enable the investor to capture the dividend paid by the underlying   stock, which should more than offset the marginal time value lost due   to early exercise. So the question is how well do you see the time value factor here?",
            "The crucial insight is that the alternative to early exercise of an American call is not necessarily to hold it to expiry, but to sell it. And selling it, at its value, is always better than exercising it.  Note that this holds only for options on assets that don't pay dividends. Here's the proof, using Put-Call-Parity. We know that at expiry T, we have (using a Call and a Put both struck at K): C(T) - P(T) = S(T) - K (if this is not clear to you, consider the case where S is less than, equal to, or greater than K at maturity, and go through each of them.) If the stock S doesn't pay any dividends (and there is no cost of carry etc.), we can replicate both sides now at time 0; we just buy one call, sell one put (that gives us the left hand side), buy the stock, and borrow money so that at time T we have to repay K (that gives us the right hand side). That means that now, we only need to borrow df * K, where df is the discount factor, and is less than one (assuming the good old pre-2009 world where interest rates are positive). Thus: C(0) - P(0) = S(0) - df * K.  Rearranging gives: C(0) = S(0) - df * K + P(0).  That's the value of the call, if we sell it (or hold it). However, if we exercise, we only get: C_ex = S(0) - K Now, we see that C(0) > C_ex, because we subtract less (df*K < K), and add P(0).",
            "For a deep in the money, it almost makes no difference because the intrinsic value, the price of the option, is seldom far above the liquidation value, the price of the underlying less the strike price. For an at the money, ceteris paribus, an early exercise would immediately cut the value of the option to 0; however, life is not so simple as JB King has shown. Purely theoretically, for an at or near the money option, an early exercise will be an instantaneous cost because the value after exercise is less than the previously trading or implied option price."

        "question": "How does a defined contribution plan work",
        "answer": "A defined contribution plan is a retirement plan in which an employee contributes a fixed percentage of their salary into an investment account. The employer may also contribute to the account, potentially matching the employee's contributions to a certain limit. The amount the employee ultimately receives upon retirement depends on the performance of the investments made with the contributions. Unlike defined benefit plans which offer a guaranteed payout determined by the employee's salary and years of service, the benefit from a defined contribution plan can fluctuate based on the investment's performance. If the investments do well, the employee may end up with more money at retirement; if they perform poorly, there is a risk of ending up with less. Generally, the contributions and benefits of these plans are based on the employee's career earnings, and at retirement, individuals often use the accumulated sum to purchase an annuity which provides a set income for life .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"The end result is basically the same, it's just a choice of whether you want to base the final amount you receive on your salary, or on the stock market. You pay in a set proportion of your salary, and receive a set proportion of your salary in return. The pension (both contributions and benefit) are based on your career earnings. You get x% of your salary every year from retirement until death. These are just a private investment, basically: you pay a set amount in, and whatever is there is what you get at the end. Normally you would buy an annuity with the final sum, which pays you a set amount per year from retirement until death, as with the above. The amount you receive depends on how much you pay in, and the performance of the investment. If the stock market does well, you'll get more. If it does badly, you could actually end up with less. In general (in as much as anything relating to the stock market and investment can be generalised), a Defined Benefit plan is usually considered better for \"\"security\"\" - or at least, public sector ones, and a majority of people in my experience would prefer one, but it entirely depends on your personal attitude to risk. I'm on a defined benefit plan and like the fact that I basically get a benefit based on a proportion of my salary and that the amount is guaranteed, no matter what happens to the stock market in the meantime. I pay in 9% of my salary get 2% of my salary as pension, for each year I pay into the pension: no questions, no if's or buts, no performance indicators. Others prefer a defined contribution scheme because they know that it is based on the amount they pay in, not the amount they earn (although to an extent it is still based on earnings, as that's what defines how much you pay in), and because it has the potential to grow significantly based on the stock market. Unfortunately, nobody can give you a \"\"which is best\"\" answer - if I knew how pension funds were going to perform over the next 10-50 years, I wouldn't be on StackExchange, I'd be out there making a (rather large) fortune on the stock market.\"",
            "It is comparing apples to oranges. From govt or institution point of view defined contribution is better than defined benefits as they don't have to carry obligations.

This figure represents the profit allocated to each share of the company's stock and could potentially be distributed to shareholders as dividends. However, an increase in profits does not necessarily translate to a direct increase in share price or immediate personal gains for shareholders.

If it's a utility company that doesn't really grow, you don't want to see lots of changes -- the earnings per share should be stable.

            "\"What does it mean in terms of share price? Should the share price increase by 15 cents?  No, but you're on the right track. In theory, the price of a share reflects it's \"\"share\"\" of time discounted future earnings. To put it concretely, imagine a company consistently earning 15 cents a share every year and paying it all out as dividends. If you only paid 25 cents for it, you could earn five cents a share by just holding it for two years. If you imagine that stocks are priced assuming a holding period of 20 years or so, so we'd expect the stock to cost less than 3 dollars.  More accurately, the share price reflects expected future earnings. If everyone is assuming this company is growing earnings every quarter, an announcement will only confirm information people have already been trading based on. So if this 15 cents announcement is a surprise, then we'd expect the stock price to rise as a function of both the \"\"surprise\"\" in earnings, and how long we expect them to stay at this new profitability level before competition claws their earnings away.

The potential for a solid return on investment: One commenter pointed out that, with a 15% discount on the lowest price from the last two-year period, there is a guaranteed return, ranging from 30% for money invested at the beginning of a six-month window to a 180% annual return for money invested at the end of the window. The average holding window for your money being about three months, suggests an average annual return of 60% .\n2. Opportunity to immediately sell stock: If the program allows for immediate selling upon grant, this can result in a virtually risk-free profit .\n3. Additional investment strategies: Buying discounted stock provides opportunities for other investment strategies, such as selling in-the-money covered calls, which can potentially yield more than selling at strike .\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Tax complications: The discount received on the stock is taxed as ordinary income in the U.S., and if the stock price changes between receipt and sale, it could result in additional capital gains or losses. Proper record-keeping is essential to account for these complexities in your tax return .\n2. The \"hassle factor\": The process of selling new shares requires attention and management, which could be considered a drawback for some investors .\n3. Potential psychological effects: A dissenting perspective suggested that companies might offer discounts with the intention of influencing employee behavior in ways that are not necessarily in the employees' best interests .\n\nIt's worth noting that these pros and cons can vary greatly depending on the specific terms of the ESPP, the volatility of the company's stock, and one's personal financial situation. It's advised to review the terms of your ESPP carefully before signing up and consider consulting with a tax professional or financial advisor, particularly if you're dealing with the complexities of state income tax as mentioned for California residents .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Is this an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)? If so, and there is no required holding period, selling right away is essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk. One caveat is that sometimes it takes a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage, and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop. If your discount is only 5%, for example, a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out. The only other cons I can think of is ESPP contributions being withheld from you for months (albeit for a virtually guaranteed return), and it complicates your taxes a bit. On the flip side, another pro is that after you sell the shares, you are more likely to invest that money rather than spend it.",
            "\"The major pros tend to be: The major cons tend to be: Being in California, you've got state income tax to worry about as well.  It might be worth using some of that extra cash to hire someone who knows what they're doing to handle your taxes the first year, at least.  I've always maxed mine out, because it's always seemed like a solid way to make a few extra dollars.  If you can live without the money in your regular paycheck, it's always seemed that the rewards outweighed the risks.   I've also always immediately sold the stock, since I usually feel like being employed at the company is enough \"\"eggs in that basket\"\" without holding investments in the same company. (NB: I've participated in several of these ESPP programs at large international US-based software companies, so this is from my personal experience.  You should carefully review the terms of your ESPP before signing up, and I'm a software engineer and not a financial advisor.)\"",
            "Some other answers mention the ability to sell at grant. This is very important. If you have that ability, think about your guaranteed return. In my case, I get a 15% discount on the lowest 6 month window price from the last two years.  If you do the math, the worst case return can be calculated: 1) Money that from the beginning of the window, I make 15% for 6 months (30% annual return guaranteed) 2) Money at the end of the window (say the last month) is 15% for one month (180% annual return guaranteed) In the end, your average holding window for your money is about 3 months (you can calculate it exactly). At that rate, you have a guaranteed 60% annual return. You can't beat that anywhere, with a significant upside if your company stock is increasing. So, if your company has an instant sell at grant option, you have to be brain dead not to do it. If it takes time to get your shares, then you need to look at the volatility of the stock to see how big the chance of losing money is. To generalize to a formula (if that's what you want): WM = purchase window (in months); D = Discount Percentage; GR = Guaranteed Return GR = 12/(WM/2) * D = 6*D/WM One last thing, If you are going to participate in ESPP, make you that you understand how to do your taxes yourself. I haven't found a tax person yet who does ESPP correctly (including an ex IRS agent), so I always have to do my taxes myself to make sure they get done correctly.",
            "Assuming US. The only con that I know of is that hassle factor. You have to remember to sell when you get the new shares, and your taxes become a bit more complicated; the discount that you receive is taxed as ordinary income, and then any change in the price of the stock between when you receive it and you sell it will be considered a capital gain or loss. It's not hard to account for properly if you keep good records.",
            "One major benefit to being able to buy discounted company stock is that you can sell in-the-money covered calls and potentially make more than you would selling at strike.",
            "I see another way of looking at this that hasn't been addressed yet. By offering the discount, the company is attempting to change your behavior into doing something irrational, that benefits them at your expense. The company hopes for one (or more) of the following psychological effects to happen to you: The proper thing to do, if you have enough capital to prevent margin calls, it to short-sell the stock at the same instant the price is set, thus locking in the profit. Eventually you can take possession of the shares and deliver them to offset the short -- hopefully before you get a margin call from the stock dropping."

        "answer": "To start investing in stocks, it's important to first commit to educating yourself about the stock market and investment strategies. One recommended approach is to spend your initial funds on research materials and to read every book you can find on investing and stock market analysis. For example, Warren Buffett started his career by reading extensively on the topic.\n\nWhen it comes to the practical steps, consider the following:\n\n1. **Start Small**: If you only have a small amount to invest initially, consider low-cost index funds or mutual funds with a low minimum investment, so you can avoid high commission costs that would eat into small profits from individual stock trades .\n\n2. **Research**: Utilize resources such as company filings to research potential investments. Free databases like SEDAR, EDGAR, and Companies House provide access to financial documents for Canadian, U.S., and European companies, respectively. Analyze different strategies and arguments regarding stock picks and make an informed decision based on your research .\n\n3. **Practice Accounts**: Before investing real money, use a free practice account offered by many banks or stock houses. This allows you to test your strategies and understand the dynamics of stock trading without the risk of losing actual funds .\n\n4. **Stock Selection Strategies**: Look for companies with a stable history of paying dividends, consistent dividend growth that doesn't exceed their net profits per share, and a share price with a long history of appreciation. These criteria often indicate a solid and reliable company, though they are quite rare .\n\n5. **Diversify**: When you're ready to invest real money, make sure to diversify. This means not putting all your savings into individual stocks. You can consider a diversified index fund for a portion of your investments, as it carries less risk than solely investing in individual stocks .\n\n6. **Brokerage Selection**: Choose a reputable brokerage for your investments. Look for one that is well-established, profitable, and offers a range of investment options such as ETFs and mutual funds without heavy fees or commissions .\n\nRemember, investing in the stock market carries risk, and there is a chance of losing some or all of your investment, so only invest money that you can afford to lose without impacting your financial security.

If you are not trying to beat the market, which is probably not something an amateur like you or I should attempt, then you should consider low cost index funds. I have money in mutual funds, some of which, have as low as a $100 minimum investment. I have moved entirely away from picking stocks. It was a good experience and I could afford to lose the money, but as a long term strategy, it just was not working for me. Note: This is coming from an American.

They then show how much that portfolio would have increased or decreased as well as talking about some of the good & bad points of the stocks in the list. It's interesting to see over time a very few stocks show up on multiple lists for different strategies. These ones in my opinion are the stocks to be investing in.

Use that account and their screening tools to try out your strategies and see if you can make money picking stocks.  My personal stock-picking strategy is to look for companies with: - a long uninterrupted history of paying dividends, - that are regularly increased, - and do not exceed the net profit per share of the company - and whose share price has a long history of increasing These are called unicorn companies, because there are so very few of them.  Another great read is, \"\"Do Stocks Outperform Treasury Bills?\"\" by Hendrik Bessembinder. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447 In this paper the author looks at the entire history of the U.S. stock universe and finds that less than 4% of stocks are responsible for 100% of the wealth creation in the U.S. stock market. He discusses his strategies for picking the winners, but it also suggests that if you don't want to do any research, you could pick pretty much any stock at random, short it, and wait. I avoid mutual funds because they are a winner only for the fellas selling them. A great description on why the mutual fund industry is skewed against the investor can be found in a book called \"\"The RRSP Secret\"\" by Greg Habstritt. \"\"Unshakeable\"\" by Tony Robbins also discusses why mutual funds are not the best way to invest in stocks. The investor puts up 100% of the money, takes 100% of the risk, and gets at best 30% of the return. Rich people don't invest like that.\"",
            "\"Everything that I'm saying presumes that you're young, and won't need your money back for 20+ years, and that you're going to invest additional money in the future. Your first investments should never be individual stocks. That is far too risky until you have a LOT more experience in the market. (Once you absolutely can't resist, keep it to under 5% of your total investments. That lets you experiment without damaging your returns too much.) Instead you would want to invest in one or more mutual funds of some sort, which spreads out your investment across MANY companies. With only $50, avoiding a trading commission is paramount. If you were in the US, I would recommend opening a free online brokerage account and then purchasing a no-load commission-free mutual fund. TD Ameritrade, for example, publishes a list of the funds that you can purchase without commission. The lists generally include the type of fund (index, growth, value, etc.) and its record of return. I don't know if Europe has the same kind of discount brokerages / mutual funds the US has, but I'd be a little surprised if it didn't. You may or may not be able to invest until you first scrape together a $500 minimum, but the brokerages often have special programs/accounts for people just starting out. It should be possible to ask. One more thing on picking a fund: most charge about a 1% annual expense ratio. (That means that a $100 investment that had a 100% gain after one year would net you $198 instead of $200, because 1% of the value of your asset ($200) is $2. The math is much more complicated, and depends on the value of your investment at every given point during the year, but that's the basic idea.) HOWEVER, there are index funds that track \"\"the market\"\" automatically, and they can have MUCH lower expense fees (0.05%, vs 1%) for the same quality of performance. Over 40 years, the expense ratio can have a surprisingly large impact on your net return, even 20% or more! You'll want to google separately about the right way to pick a low-expense index fund. Your online brokerage may also be able to help. Finally, ask friends or family what mutual funds they've invested in, how they chose those funds, and what their experience has been. The point is not to have them tell you what to do, but for you to learn from the mistakes and successes of other experienced investors with whom you can follow up.\""

        "answer": "If you have sold all shares of a stock where a wash sale existed, the potential wash sale effect goes away after 30 days from the dividend date. Selling all the shares effectively negates the wash, allowing you to take the loss. Therefore, you would be able to adjust for the disallowed year-end wash-sale loss after this period. However, please note that wash sale rules would still generally apply, and this information is based on general practices and opinions. It's recommended to consult a tax professional, such as an Enrolled Agent (EA) or Certified Public Accountant (CPA) licensed in your state, for personalized advice and confirmation of these rules as they apply to your specific situation.",

        "answer": "The document indicates that dividend yield can be difficult to track because it's a moving target. Since dividends are paid periodically, the yield is calculated based on the stock price when the dividend is declared, and this figure can be updated by various services with different frequencies. There is a suggestion in the text to calculate personalized dividend yield by annualizing the dividend payment divided by the cost basis per share.\n\nFor historical data, Morningstar provides 5-year averages of dividend yields for free, as mentioned in the 'Current Valuation' section of their valuation pages. It is recognized in the document that looking back on dividend yields is a challenging task because one must decide whether to look at the actual dividends paid through the year divided by the share price at the time, or to look at the annualized dividend at the time of issue and then average those. Furthermore, since the stock price fluctuates, the yield changes, and depending on where one bought the stock, the actual yield can vary from the published amount.\n\nTo exemplify, suppose you have shares in a company which issues a quarterly dividend of $1 per share and the share price is $100. If a few years later the company issues a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share and the share price is $160, but the shares were purchased at $100, the annual yield on the investment would be 6%, not the published 3.75%.\n\nTherefore, when considering dividend yields over multiple years, one needs to take into account that it is subject to variations influenced by changes in the stock price, the timing of dividend payments, and any particular method used for yield calculation .",

Your annual yield on X is 6%, not the published 3.75%.  All of this is to say that looking back on dividend yields is somewhat similar to nailing jello to the wall.  Do you look at actual dividends paid through the year divided by share price?  Do you look at the annualized dividend at the time of issue then average those?

        "answer": "An \"In-the-Money\" (ITM) call option is one where the strike price is below the current market price of the underlying asset. This means that if the call option were to be exercised, the option holder would be able to buy the underlying asset at less than its current market price, capturing immediate value, which is referred to as the option's intrinsic value. In contrast, an \"Out-of-the-Money\" (OTM) call option has a strike price that is above the current market price of the underlying asset, which means there would be no inherent profit in exercising the option, as the market price would be better than the option's strike price. As a result, an OTM call option has no intrinsic value, but may still carry a premium due to the time value, which represents the potential for the option to become ITM before its expiration date.\n\nIn the document provided, there is mention that the intrinsic value (the \"in the money\" component) and the time value are the two components of option valuation. An in-the-money put option like the $395 put mentioned is already profitable if it were to be exercised at the current market price of $376, while the out-of-the-money $365 put needs the stock to fall further before it can be exercised at a profit .\n\nThe value of an ITM option will move in relation to the underlying asset's price but may not increase at the same rate due to the remaining time value, which can be affected by factors like implied volatility and time to expiration. For OTM options, the value is highly dependent on the volatility and the likelihood of the asset price reaching the strike price before expiration. The document also alludes to the dynamics of options pricing concerning the stock\u2019s movement and its distance from the strike price as well as the time remaining until the option's expiration .\n\nIt's important to note that while an ITM option has intrinsic value, both ITM and OTM options can be influenced by other market factors, including volatility, which can affect their premiums. The Black-Scholes model is typically used to price options and takes into account various inputs including stock price, strike price, time to expiration, and volatility to determine an option's premium .",

        "answer": "While the search results did not directly address the question of using a Roth IRA as a savings account, there are insights that can help answer this query.\n\nA Roth IRA is commonly recommended for retirement savings due to its tax advantages, particularly the fact that earnings in the account grow tax-free and distributions in retirement are also tax-free . Roth IRAs are designed to serve as long-term investment vehicles, not as conventional savings accounts. While you can withdraw your contributions (but not your earnings) from a Roth IRA at any time without penalty, the primary purpose of a Roth IRA is to save for retirement rather than to act like a regular savings account for short-term needs.\n\nHowever, because you can withdraw your contributions at any time without taxes or penalties, some individuals might use their Roth IRA as a type of savings account for their emergency fund or other short-term financial goals. This approach is not typically recommended by financial advisors because it could reduce the amount of money you will have saved for retirement. \n\nUsing a Roth IRA in this manner could result in missed opportunities for long-term growth and compound interest, which are significant benefits of Roth IRAs when used properly as part of a retirement strategy . Additionally, unlike savings accounts, Roth IRAs have annual contribution limits and rules about eligibility based on income, which could make them less flexible than a savings account for the purpose of regular deposits and withdrawals. \n\nGiven these points, it is important to consider your financial goals and consult with a financial advisor to determine whether using a Roth IRA as a savings account is a suitable strategy for you.",

Instead, consider tax-free investments.

In addition - there's capital appreciation of your fund holdings. There are risks, of course, for example rate changes will affect yields and capital appreciation, so consult with someone knowledgeable in this area (or ask another question here, for the basics). This will give you the same result as you're expecting from your Roth IRA trick, without damaging your retirement savings potential.",

        "question": "How is the opening-day price of a stock decided?",
        "answer": "The opening-day price of a stock, especially in the context of an initial public offering (IPO), is influenced by a variety of factors. While there are no strict \"rules\" dictating how the price should act after an IPO, typically, IPOs are underpriced intentionally. This underpricing can lead to what is commonly referred to as a \"pop\" on the opening day, where the share price increases significantly from the IPO price. On average, shares are known to end up around 10% higher at the end of the first day after the IPO, although this is based on historical trends and isn't a guaranteed outcome. \n\nFurthermore, after an IPO, the underwriter may serve as a stabilizing agent, supporting the trading of the share for a certain period. Part of this process can involve the creation of an \"overallotment pool,\" which allows clients to receive additional shares not from the company but from the underwriter, effectively creating a situation where the underwriter is short selling the stock. To mitigate the risk of market exposure, the underwriter receives a \"greenshoe option,\" which allows them to buy back the oversold shares at the IPO price. This mechanism ensures that if the price falls, the underwriter can profit by buying back shares at a lower market price, or if the price rises, the option lets the underwriter cover the short position by buying shares at the fixed IPO price, avoiding a loss.\n\nIPO prices may be set by the underwriters in such a way to cause this initial surge in the price on the opening day because it may create a positive perception of the IPO success. However, some companies might prefer that their underwriters set the price more accurately to avoid a large pop, aiming instead for a stable price performance on the first trading day .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "When a stock is going to become public there's a level of analysis required to figure out the range of IPO price that makes sense. For a company that's somewhat mature, and has a sector to compare it to, you can come up with a range that would be pretty close. For the recent linkedin, it's tougher to price a somewhat unique company, running at a loss, in a market rich with cash looking for the next great deal. If one gives this any thought, an opening price that's so far above the IPO price represents a failure of the underwriters to price it correctly. It means the original owners just sold theirvshares for far less than the market thought they were worth on day one. The day of IPO the stock opens similar to how any stock would open at 9:30, there are bids and asks and a price at which supply (the ask) and demand (bid) balance. For this IPO, it would appear that there were enough buyers to push the price to twice the anticipated open and it's maintained that level since.  It's possible to have a different system in which a Dutch auction is used to make the shares public, in theory this can work, it's just not used commonly."

        "question": "What's the difference, if any, between stock appreciation and compound interest?",
        "answer": "Stock appreciation and compound interest are two distinct financial concepts:\n\n1. **Stock Appreciation**:\nStock appreciation refers to the increase in the value of a stock over time. When you invest in a stock, you hope that the company will perform well, leading to increased demand for its shares in the market. This demand can cause the price of the stock to go up, so if you sell the stock later at a higher price than what you paid for it, you realize a profit from the appreciation of that stock. Stock appreciation does not include the dividend payments that might be made over the time you hold the stock; it only refers to the increase in the stock's price.\n\n2. **Compound Interest**:\nCompound interest, on the other hand, is the interest on a deposit or loan that is calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. In other words, compound interest is \"interest on interest\" and will make a sum of money grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount. Compound interest is a concept typically associated with savings accounts, bonds, or certificates of deposit (CDs).\n\nThe primary difference between the two is that stock appreciation is tied to the market value and performance of a specific company and its shares, while compound interest is related to the growth of a sum of money through interest earnings over time in a more predictable and mathematical way.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Compounding is just the notion that the current period's growth (or loss) becomes the next period's principal. So, applied to stocks, your beginning value, plus growth (or loss) in value, plus any dividends, becomes the beginning value for the next period. Your value is compounded as you measure the performance of the investment over time. Dividends do not participate in the compounding unless you reinvest them.  Compound interest is just the principle of compounding applied to an amount owed, either by you, or to you. You have a balance with which a certain percentage is calculated each period and is added to the balance. The new balance is used to calculate the next period's interest, which again adds to the balance, etc. Obviously, it's better to be on the receiving end of a compound interest calculation than on the paying end. Interest bearing investments, like bonds, pay simple interest. Like stock dividends, you would have to invest the interest in something else in order to get a compounding effect. When using a basic calculator tool for stocks, you would include the expected average annual growth rate plus the expected annual dividend rate as your \"\"interest\"\" rate. For bonds you would use the coupon rate plus the expected rate of return on whatever you put the interest into as the \"\"interest\"\" rate. Factoring in risk, you would just have to pick a different rate for a simple calculator, or use a more complex tool that allows for more variables over time. Believe it or not, this is where you would start seeing all that calculus homework pay off!\"",
            "\"If you mean, If I invest, say, $1000 in a stock that is growing at 5% per year, versus investing $1000 in an account that pays compound interest of 5% per year, how does the amount I have after 5 years compare? Then the answer is, They would be exactly the same.  As Kent Anderson says, \"\"compound interest\"\" simply means that as you accumulate interest, that for the next interest cycle, the amount that they pay interest on is based on the previous cycle balance PLUS the interest. For example, suppose you invest $1000 at 5% interest compounded annually. After one year you get 5% of $1000, or $50. You now have $1050. At the end of the second year, you get 5% of $1050 -- not 5% of the original $1000 -- or $52.50, so you now have $1102.50. Etc. Stocks tend to grow in the same way. But here's the big difference: If you get an interest-bearing account, the bank or investment company guarantees the interest rate. Unless they go bankrupt, you WILL get that percentage interest. But there is absolutely no guarantee when you buy stock. It may go up 5% this year, up 4% next year, and down 3% the year after. The company makes no promises about how much growth the stock will show. It may show a loss. It all depends on how well the company does.\""

This means that even if you take on more risk by choosing investments that have a higher potential for return (and higher potential for loss), you have more time to ride out the volatility of the market. Specifically, since you are likely in a lower tax bracket at a younger age, investing in a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), where you pay taxes on contributions now rather than upon withdrawal, might be beneficial. Additionally, taking advantage of employer matching, if available, is a smart move as it effectively provides a guaranteed return on your investments.\n\nAlways remember to consider your own financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals when making decisions about your 401(k) investments, and consider seeking advice from a financial professional for personalized guidance.",

Most financial planners would say this is way too risky, which sort of addresses your question.  I seek high return rather than protection of principal.  If I was you at 22, I would mainly look at high returns rather than protection of principal. The short answer is, that even if your investments drop by half, you have plenty of time to recover.  But onto the long answer. You sort of have to imagine yourself close to retirement age, and what that would look like.  If you are contributing at 22, I would say that it is likely that you end up with 3 million (in today's dollars).  Will you have low or high monthly  expenses?  Will you have other sources of income such as rental properties?   Let's say you rental income that comes close to covering your monthly expenses, but is short about 12K per year.  You have a couple of options: So in the end let's say you are ready to retire with about 60K in cash above your emergency fund.  You have the ability to live off that cash for 5 years.  You can replenish that fund from equity investments at opportune times.  Its also likely you equity investments will grow a lot more than your expenses and any emergencies.  There really is no need to have a significant amount out of equities.  In the case cited, real estate serves as your cash investment.

Since your 401(k) contributions are usually made with each paycheck this gives you the added benefit of dollar cost averaging throughout your career.  There used to be a common rule that you should put 100 minus your age as the percentage invested in the stock market and the rest in bonds, but with interest rates being so low, bonds have underperformed, so many experts now recommend 110 or even 120 minus your age for stocks percentage. My recommendation is that you wait until you are 40 and then move 25% into bonds, then increase it to 40% at 55 years old. At 65 I would jump to a 50-50 stock/bonds mix and when you start taking distributions I would move to a stable-value income portfolio. I also recommend that you roll your funds into a Vanguard IRA when you change jobs so that you take advantage of their low management fee index mutual funds (that have no fees for trading).  You can pick whatever mix feels best for you, but at your age I would suggest a 50-50 mix between the S&P 500 (large cap) and the Russell 2000 (small cap).

I'd suggest 10% in bonds, maybe more, just because maintaining that balance automatically encourages buy-low-sell-high as the market cycles. As you get older and closer to needing a large chunk of the money (for a house, or after retirement), you would move progressively more of that to other categories such as bonds to help safeguard your earnings.  Some folks will say this an overly conservative approach. On the other hand, it requires almost zero effort and has netted me an average 10% return (or so claims Quicken) over the past two decades, and that average includes the dot-bomb and the great recession.

While the upside of risk, assuming you can expect higher returns the more risk you take, are most significant on the long term.  In short: for you're financial life, it's smart to save as much as you can and invest these savings with a lot of risk.  So, what is smart to invest in? The most important rule is to keep your investment costs as low as possible. Risk and returns are strongly related, however investment costs lower the returns, while you keep the risk. Be aware of the investment industry marketing fancy investment products. Most of them leave you with higher costs and lower returns. Research strongly suggests that an lowcost etf portfolio is our best choice. Personally, i disregard this new smart beta hype as a marketing effort from the financial industry. They charge more investment costs (that's a certain) and promise better returns because they are geniuses (hmmm...). No thanks. As suggested in other comments, I would go for an low cost (you shouldn't pay more than 0.2% per year) etf portfolio with a global diversification, with at least 90% in stocks. Actually that is what I've been doing for three years now (I'm 27 years old).",
            "At twenty-two, you can have anywhere between 100%-70% of your securities portfolio in equities. It is reasonable to start at 100% and reduce over time.  The one thing that I would mention with that is that your target at retirement should be 70% stocks/30% bonds.  You should NEVER have more than 30% bonds.  Why?  Because a 70/30 mix is both safer than 100% bonds and will give a higher return.  Absent some market timing strategy (which as an amateur investor, you should absolutely avoid) or some complicated balancing scheme, there is never a reason to be at more than 30% bonds.   A 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds or a 100% bonds ratio not only returns less than the 70/30 mix, it is actually riskier.  Why?  Because sometimes bonds fall.  And when they do, stocks generally gain.  And vice versa.  Because of this behavior, the 70/30 mix is less likely to fall than 50% or 100% bonds.   Does that mean that your stock percentage should never drop below 70%?  No.  If your portfolio contains things other than stocks and bonds, it is reasonable for stocks to fall below 70%.  The problem is that when you drop stocks below 70%, you should drop bonds below 30% as well.  So you keep the stock to bond ratio at 7:3.   If you want to get a lower risk than a 70/30 mix, then you should move into cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are actually safer than stocks and bonds either individually or in combination.  But at twenty-two, you don't really need more safety.   At twenty-two, the first thing to do is to build your emergency fund.  This should be able to handle six months of expenses without income.  I recommend making it equal to six months of your income.  The reason being that it is easy to calculate your income and difficult to be sure of expenses.  Also, you can save six months of income at twenty-two.   Are you going to stay where you are for the next five years?  At twenty-two, the answer is almost certainly no.  But the standard is the five year time frame.  If you want a bigger place or one that is closer to work, then no.  If you stay somewhere at least five years, then it is likely that the advantages to owning rather than renting will outweigh the costs of switching houses.  Less than five years, the reverse is true.  So you should probably rent now.   You can max out your 401k and IRA now.  Doing so even with a conservative strategy will produce big returns by sixty-seven.  And perhaps more importantly, it helps keep your spending down.  The less you do spend, the less you will feel that you need to spend.   Once you fill your emergency fund, start building savings for a house.  I would consider putting them in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).  A REIT will tend to track real estate.  Since you want to buy real estate with the results, this is its own kind of safety.  It fell in value?  Houses are probably cheap.  Houses increasing in price rapidly?  A REIT is probably growing by leaps and bounds.  You do this outside your retirement accounts, as you want to be able to access it without penalty."

        "question": "Are Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) less safe than regular mutual funds?",
        "answer": "Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are not inherently less safe than mutual funds; the safety of either type of investment depends on various factors, including the underlying assets, the fund's management, and market conditions. However, there are some differences between ETFs and mutual funds that could affect their relative safety or suitability for certain investors:\n\n1. Liquidity: ETFs are traded on stock exchanges like a stock, which means they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices. This can be seen as an advantage in terms of liquidity compared to mutual funds, which are typically only priced and can be redeemed at the end of the trading day. However, this could also lead to speculative behavior that might not be in the best interest of retail investors.\n\n2. Investment Flexibility: ETFs allow for more sophisticated investment strategies, such as short selling or using options, to hedge against declines in value. This might suit more sophisticated investors who can handle such additional investment complexities.\n\n3. Expense Ratios and Transaction Costs: ETFs can have lower expense ratios than mutual funds, especially when considering transaction costs over time. The introduction of ETFs with no transaction fees has made them more competitive against index mutual funds in terms of costs.\n\n4. Spreads and Volume: ETFs may have wider spreads, particularly low-volume funds, which means the buying price might be higher than the selling price at any given time. This can be an additional cost consideration, as wider spreads can affect the overall cost of buying and selling ETF units.\n\n5. Passively Managed Funds: Both index mutual funds and ETFs that track the same index will, in an ideal world, reflect the same performance. However, there can be tracking errors that result in performance differences. This can affect both ETFs and index mutual funds similarly.\n\nIn summary, the safety or risk associated with ETFs versus mutual funds largely depends on how they align with an investor's risk tolerance, investment strategy, and financial goals. While ETFs offer advantages in flexibility, potential lower costs, and liquidity, mutual funds may offer a more traditional approach with potential safeguards against impulsive trading decisions. Ultimately, the choice between ETFs and mutual funds should be made based on a comprehensive understanding of each investor's unique circumstances and investment objectives .",

            "\"I wonder if ETF's are further removed from the actual underlying holdings or assets giving value to the fund, as compared to regular mutual funds. Not exactly removed. But slightly different. Whenever a Fund want to launch an ETF, it would buy the underlying shares; create units. Lets say it purchased 10 of A, 20 of B and 25 of C. And created 100 units for price x. As part of listing, the ETF company will keep the purchased shares of A,B,C with a custodian. Only then it is allowed to sell the 100 units into the market. Once created, units are bought or sold like regular stock. In case the demand is huge, more units are created and the underlying shares kept with custodian.  So, for instance, would VTI and Total Stock Market Index Admiral Shares be equally anchored to the underlying shares of the companies within the index? Yes they are. Are they both connected? Yes to an extent. The way Vanguard is managing this is given a Index [Investment Objective]; it is further splitting the common set of assets into different class. Read more at Share Class. The Portfolio & Management gives out the assets per share class. So Vanguard Total Stock Market Index is a common pool that has VTI ETF, Admiral and Investor Share and possibly Institutional share. Is VTI more of a \"\"derivative\"\"? No it is not a derivative. It is a Mutual Fund.\"",
            "\"If anything, the price of an ETF is more tightly coupled to the underlying holdings or assets than a mutual fund, because of the independent creation/destruction mechanism. With a mutual fund, the price is generally set once at the end of each day, and the mutual fund manager has to deal with investments and redemptions at that price. By the time they get to buying or selling the underlying assets, the market may have moved or they may even move the market with those transactions. With an ETF, investment and redemption is handled by independent \"\"authorized participants\"\". They can create new units of the ETF by buying up the underlying assets and delivering them to the ETF manager, and vice versa they can cancel units by requesting the underlying assets from the ETF manager. ETFs trade intraday (i.e. at any time during trading hours) and any time the price diverges too far from the underlying assets, one of the authorized participants has an incentive to make a small profit by creating or destroying units of the ETF, also intraday.\""

        "question": "Brokerage account for charity",
        "answer": "From the documents provided, it appears that in the context of brokerage accounts for charity, there are tax advantages to donating stock directly to a charity instead of selling it first and then donating the cash. If the charity accepts stock, you avoid the tax on long-term capital gains when you donate it. For instance, if you donate $10,000 worth of stock, you can write off $10,000 on your taxes, potentially receiving a significant tax refund, whereas if you sold the stock first and then donated the cash after paying taxes on capital gains, the benefit would be reduced  . \n\nTherefore, in managing a brokerage account for the purpose of benefiting a charity, it may be more advantageous to donate appreciated securities directly rather than liquidating them first.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting the context in which you'd be managing investments in a brokerage account for charitable purposes. For example, ensuring diversification of investments is important for managing risk, and this could be relevant if you're looking to grow the portfolio over time before making charitable gifts  .\n\nWhen considering which charities to donate to, tools like Charity Navigator are recommended to evaluate the efficiency with which charities use donations, thereby ensuring that your contributions have the maximum impact  .\n\nIt's also important to mention that the specifics of tax deductions can vary based on individual circumstances and tax laws, which are subject to change. Therefore, it's advisable to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor for personalized advice.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "If the charity accepts stock, you can avoid the tax on the long term cap gain when you donate it. e.g. I donate $10,000 in value of Apple. I write off $10,000 on my taxes, and benefit with a $2500 refund. If I sold it, I'd have nearly a $1500 tax bill (bought long enough ago, the basis is sub $100).  Any trading along the way, and it's on you. Gains long or short are taxed on you. It's only the final donation that matters here.  Edit - to address Anthony's comment on other answer - I sell my Apple, with a near $10,000 gain (it's really just $9900) and I am taxed $1500. Now I have $8500 cash I donate and get $2125 back in a tax refund. By donating the stock I am ahead nearly $375, and the charity, $1500.",
            "I don't understand the logic in the other answer, and I think it doesn't make sense, so here is my take: You pay taxes on income, not on sales price. So if you put X $ of your own money in the account and it becomes X + Y $ in the future, at the moment of liquidation, you will own taxes on the Y $. Never on the X $, as it was your own (already taxed) money to begin with. The difference between long-term and short-term gains just influences the tax rate on Y. If you donate the gain alone (the Y $) to charity, you can deduct Y from your tax base. So adding Y to your tax base and then deducting Y again obviously leaves your tax base at the old value, so you pay no extra taxes. Which seems logical, as you didn't make any money in the process. Aside from extreme cases where the deductible gain is too large a percentage from your income or negative, I don't see why this would ever be different. So you can take your original 100 $ back out and donate all gains, and be fine. Note that potential losses are seen different, as the IRA regulations are not symmetric."

        "question": "Starting an investment portfolio with Rs 5,000/-",
        "answer": "Starting an investment portfolio with Rs 5,000/- involves several considerations to ensure diversification and balance between risks and returns. Here are some insights and suggestions based on the content provided in the document:\n\n1. **Diversification**: It's important to diversify your investments to spread out risk. Diversification means investing in a variety of assets so that the performance of one investment doesn't dominate your overall portfolio. This could include a mix of large cap and small cap stocks, bonds, and potentially international exposure and real estate through a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) .\n\n2. **Risk Tolerance**: Your portfolio should reflect your risk tolerance. If you are risk-averse, you might want to keep a larger portion of your funds in a cash account or other low-risk investment, and invest the rest in a diversified portfolio .\n\n3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider an asset allocation that matches your investment time horizon. For a longer time horizon, you could have a higher proportion of equities, and for a shorter time horizon, a larger allocation to bonds or cash to reduce risk. For a balanced portfolio, a suggestion could be having 60% in equities and 40% in bonds .\n\n4. **Cost-Effective Investment Options**: Look for low-cost investment options such as low-cost ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) that provide global diversification. This could include index funds that track a broad market index and have low management fees, ensuring that a larger portion of your returns isn't eroded by costs .\n\n5. **Start Slowly**: Initially, consider using some of your excess income to slowly build your portfolio. Drip-feeding money into investments can help manage risk and provide you with the opportunity to learn and adapt as you go .\n\n6. **Long-Term Perspective**: Invest with a long-term perspective, especially if you're young. As you have more time to recover from potential losses, you could take on more risk, which might lead to higher returns over the long run .\n\nIt's advised to start by researching and understanding the different types of investment products available and considering how they fit with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, stay informed about investment strategies and potential costs associated with each product.\n\nRemember, while the advice provided here is based on general principles of investing, each investor's situation is unique and it's important to consult with a financial advisor or conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

            "Given that you are starting with a relatively small amount, you want a decent interest rate, and you want flexibility, I would consider fixed deposit laddering strategy.

If you need this money, you use it. If you don't need it, purchase another 90-day fixed deposit. If you keep going this way, you will have a deposit mature every 30 days and can choose to use it or renew the fixed deposit. This strategy has some disadvantages to consider: As for interest rates, the length of the fixed deposit in positively related to the interest rate. If you want higher interest rates, elect for longer fixed deposit cycles.For instance, when you become more confident about your financial situation, replace the 30, 60, 90 day cycle with a 6, 12, 18 month cycle The cost of maintaining the short term deposit renewals and new purchases. If your bank does not allow such transactions through on line banking, you might spend more time than you like at a bank or on the phone with the bank You want a monthly dividend but this might not be the case with fixed deposits.

For example you can buy a stock which is likely to go higher, and to limit your risks, you can buy a put option on the same stock, so even if the price falls drastically, you can exercise your option and not lose anything except for the premium you paid.

        "question": "Why does the calculation for percentage profit vary based on whether a position is short vs. long?",
        "answer": "The calculation for percentage profit varies between short and long positions due to the nature of the initial investment and cash flows involved. Typically, for long positions, the calculation is straightforward as it involves an initial cash outflow (the amount paid to buy the asset) followed by a later cash inflow when the asset is sold, assuming the price has increased.\n\nHowever, for short positions, this traditional approach does not apply since short selling involves a different kind of transaction. When initiating a short position, an investor borrows shares and sells them at the current market price with the obligation to buy back the shares later to return them to the lender. If the price drops, they can repurchase the stock at a lower price, profiting from the difference. Thus, the initial 'investment' is actually the receipt of money from the sale of the borrowed shares.\n\nWhen we want to apply the concept of a return on investment to a short sale, we need to compare the amount the investor gets to keep (the initial proceeds from the short sale minus the cost to buy back and return the shares) to the 'initial amount' of the liability. For example, if you short sell a share at $50 and close the position by buying it back at $25, you would keep $25. The rate of return calculation would then consider the performance of this $25 in relation to the initial value of the share that was short sold. As such, in this case, the profit from the short sale is 100% relative to the initial share sold, even though the entire amount of cash received is not reinvested to close the position\u2014only the necessary amount to repurchase the share is used.",

There's a good explanation about calculating the return from a short sale at Investopedia.  Here's the part that I consider most relevant: [...] When calculating the return of a short sale, you need to compare the amount the trader gets to keep to the initial amount of the liability.   Had the trade in our example turned against you, you (as the short   seller) would owe not only the initial proceeds amount but also the   excess amount, and this would come out of your pocket. [...] Refer to the source link for the full explanation. Update: As you can see from the other answers and comments, it is a more complex a Q&A than it may first appear.  I subsequently found this interesting paper which discusses the difficulty of rate of return with respect to short sales and other atypical trades: Excerpt: [...]   The problem causing this almost uniform omission of a percentage   return on short sales, options (especially writing), and futures, it   may be speculated, is that the nigh-well universal and conventional   definition of rate of return involving an initial cash outflow   followed by a later cash inflow does not appear to fit these   investment situations. None of the investment finance texts nor   general finance texts, undergraduate or graduate, have formally or   explicitly shown how to resolve this predicament or how to justify the   calculations they actually use.

Their point is that if you have more upswings than downswings - you'll gain more on long positions during upswings than on short positions during downswings on average. Again - simple math.",
            "The problem with rate of return calculation on short positions is, that the commonly used approach assumes an initial investment creating a cash outflow. If we want to apply this approach to short selling, we should look at the trade from another perspective. We buy money and pay for this money with stock. Our investment to buy 50$ in your example is 1 share.  When closing the short position, we effectively sell back our money (50$) and receive 2 shares. Our profit on this position is obviously 1 share. Setting this in relation to our investment of 1 share yields a performance of 100%   in reality, we do not sell back the entire cash but only the amount needed to get back our investment of 1 share. This is actually comparable to a purchase of stock which we only partially close to get back our invested cash amount and keep the remaining shares as our profit"

        "question": "Short an option - random assignment?",
        "answer": "When you are short an option, you are essentially engaging in a \"sell to open\" transaction, where you are selling an option that you do not currently own. This action creates a new options contract and opens a new position that you would eventually close out, typically by buying back the option (buy to close). Shorting an option means that you are taking a position that benefits if the option's value decreases. If you are already short an option, you can buy it back to close and exit the position .\n\nIt's also important to note that \"covered\" implies that you have assets in your account to satisfy the terms of the options contract. For example, a \"covered call\" refers to a call option that you sell while owning the underlying stock, which you would sell to the option buyer at the strike price if they exercise the option .\n\nThe distinction between shorting options and other positions is that it involves taking on a risk with potentially unlimited losses, even though the gains are limited to the premium received for selling the option.

        "answer": "The document discusses various aspects of investing in stocks (equities) and bonds. Here are some key points from the text regarding the relationship between bonds and equities and their behavior during market fluctuations:\n\n1. While comparing investments across multiple instruments, it is suggested to compare returns; when comparing stocks to other instruments, the return on stock price or return on capital employed (ROCE) can be considered depending on whether one is comparing trading performance or fundamental performance .\n\n2. Government bonds have essentially zero correlation with stocks, which means they don't significantly add or reduce stock portfolio volatility. Corporate bonds, on the other hand, generally have a positive but weak correlation with stocks (except for high-yield junk bonds), so they offer some level of diversification to a stock portfolio .\n\n3. Negative correlation assets, which could be used to offset losses during a market crash, are typically called insurance and can be more costly as they reduce risk. The mix of investments that includes corporate bonds, government bonds, and other assets depends on the individual's risk tolerance and overall investment strategy  .\n\n4. Short-term government bonds are considered a low-risk asset, suitable for very risk-averse individuals, while long-term government bonds are not risk-free as their value may fluctuate with interest rate changes .\n\n5. Despite bonds not being entirely free of risk, they are recommended as a part of a diversification strategy for a reasonable portfolio because different assets will sometimes move in opposite directions, potentially canceling out each other's risk .\n\n6. The document suggests that bond returns may look relatively better than they have in the past, especially given a broader slowdown in global economic growth and the expectation of lower returns on all investments in the future .\n\nThese points indicate that bonds and equities have different risk profiles and behaviors during market fluctuations. Incorporating both into a portfolio can provide a balance between potential growth (from equities) and stability (from bonds), which can be particularly relevant in managing risk during market downturns or crashes.\n\nPlease note that this response has been constructed based on the limited excerpts visible from the text.

The outcome varies on a case-by-case basis, and the specifics should have been outlined in the grant documentation provided to you when the restricted stock or options were issued.\n\nHere are two common scenarios that could happen in the event of a buyout:\n\n1. **Immediate vesting of all units**: This is frequently the case for RSUs or options granted to executives or key employees. Often, the grant documentation will specify scenarios that would trigger immediate vesting, such as a buyout under a \"Change in/of Control\" (CIC or COC) provision. Immediate vesting might also occur if the key employee is terminated without cause or passes away.\n\n2. **Conversion of the units to a new schedule**: This scenario is more typical for regular employee-level grants. Generally, such RSUs or option grants will convert at the deal price to a new schedule that maintains the same dates and vesting percentages. However, the number of units and the dollar amount or strike price may be adjusted so that the final result is equivalent to what it would have been before the buyout.\n\nTo better understand how your stock options might be treated in the specific scenario of your company being bought out, you should refer to your original grant documentation. If that's not clear or if you haven't received this documentation, it would be advisable to consult with your company's HR department or a financial advisor who can assist you based on the terms of your particular situation.",

Investors who do not have the $10,000 may choose to start with the Investor Shares and later convert to Admiral Shares, and this conversion would be a non-taxable event. If an investor starts with ETF shares and decides to sell them later to buy the Admiral Shares fund, this sale would be a taxable event.

        "question": "Why would Two ETFs tracking Identical Indexes Produce different Returns?",
        "answer": "Two ETFs that are tracking identical indexes may produce different returns due to a few different factors, as highlighted in the document:\n\n1. **Expense Ratio**: ETFs charge different expense ratios, which is the cost that the funds charge their investors. This fee can vary from one ETF to another, even if they track the same index, leading to differences in performance because a higher expense ratio can eat into the returns.\n\n2. **Tracking Error**: This refers to the discrepancy between the actual performance of the index and the ETF's performance. There could be a range of reasons for this tracking error, such as timing of trades, cash holdings, dividends reinvestment policies, or tax considerations. Because of these factors, an ETF's composition may not exactly mirror that of the index it is meant to replicate, which can lead to differences in performance.\n\n3. **Market Demand/Supply**: ETFs are traded like stocks on exchanges, so their prices can be affected by demand and supply dynamics in ways that traditional index funds are not. If there is increased demand for an ETF, its price might increase above the value of the index it tracks, or vice versa if there is less demand.\n\n4. **Liquidity**: ETFs can have different levels of liquidity, which can affect the bid-ask spread when buying or selling shares. An ETF with low liquidity might have a wider spread, making it less cost-effective for investors, which could impact the overall returns compared to a more liquid ETF tracking the same index .\n\nIn summary, even though ETFs tracking the same index have the goal of matching the performance of that index as closely as possible, various operational factors can lead to differences in returns. Investors should consider these factors when comparing ETFs that track the same benchmark.",

        "answer": "Reinvestment refers to the process of using dividends, distributions, interest, or capital gains earned from an investment to purchase additional shares or units of that investment rather than taking the earnings as cash. In the context of stocks, reinvestment typically applies to dividends, as capital gains are realized when the asset is sold and reinvesting those gains would simply result in owning the same amount of stock as before the sale. For mutual funds, reinvestment can apply to dividends and capital gains distributions; mutual funds are required to distribute capital gains to shareholders, and these distributions are often treated as cash dividends. Mutual funds may offer automatic reinvestment options where they use these distributions to purchase more shares of the fund for the investor .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"1) When it says \"\"an investment or mutual fund\"\", is a mutual fund not   an investment? If no, what is the definition of an investment? A mutual fund is indeed an investment. The article probably mentions  mutual funds separately from other investments because it is not uncommon for mutual funds to give you the option to automatically reinvest dividends and capital gains.    2) When it says \"\"In terms of stocks\"\", why does it only mention   distribution of dividends but not distribution of capital gains? Since distributions are received as cash deposits they can be used to buy more of the stock. Capital gains, on the other hand, occur when an asset increases in value. These gains are realized when the asset is sold. In the case of stocks, reinvestment of capital gains doesn't make much sense since buying more stock after selling it to realize capital gains results in you owning as much stock as you had before you realized the gains. 3) When it says \"\"In terms of mutual funds\"\", it says about \"\"the   reinvestment of distributions and dividends\"\". Does \"\"distributions\"\" not   include distributions of \"\"dividends\"\"? why does it mention   \"\"distributions\"\" parallel to \"\"dividends\"\"? Used in this setting, dividend and distribution are synonymous, which is highlighted by the way they are used in parallel. 4) Does reinvestment only apply to interest or dividends, but not to   capital gain? Reinvestment only applies to dividends in the case of stocks. Mutual funds must distribute capital gains to shareholders, making these distributions essentially cash dividends, usually as a special end of year distribution. If you've requested automatic reinvestment, the fund will buy more shares with these capital gain distributions as well.\""

        "question": "Should I replace bonds in a passive investment strategy",
        "answer": "Bonds still have a place in many passive portfolios due to their certain benefits like relatively low risk and the potential for diversification of stock portfolios. While it is true that interest rates have been low, yields on reasonable passive bond exposures are still around 2-4%, which is better than the near-zero recent past and expected inflation rates. This can provide a reasonable return. The decision to include or replace bonds in a passive investment portfolio can be complex and depends on factors such as your risk tolerance, return requirements, and overall investment goals. If you have a particularly high risk tolerance and high return requirements, you might consider other assets, but for many, bonds provide a valuable role in reducing risk and diversifying a portfolio .\n\nMoreover, diversification into different types of assets, such as corporate and government bonds, is generally considered a prudent approach. Corporate bonds have a positive, but not very strong correlation with stocks, helping to diversify a stock portfolio. Government bonds have essentially zero correlation, adding little volatility to a portfolio. While no risk-reducing assets are free, including both corporate and government bonds might be suitable for a well-rounded passive portfolio. For a passive portfolio, as well as any reasonable portfolio, reducing risk by diversifying into various assets can be beneficial. However, you should also take into consideration the current economic conditions, the health of the issuer, and other circumstances that may affect the safety and performance of your investments  .\n\nUltimately, the option to replace bonds in your passive investment strategy should be carefully considered, and you might want to consult with a financial advisor or seek out recommendations from respected financial communities such as the Bogleheads forum .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Bonds still definitely have a place in many passive portfolios.  While it is true that interest rates have been unusually low, yields on reasonable passive bond exposures are still around 2-4%.  This is significantly better than both recent past inflation and expected inflation both of which are near zero.   This is reasonable if not great return, but Bonds continue to have other nice properties like relatively low risk and diversification of stock portfolios (the \"\"offset[ing] losses\"\" you mention in the OP).  So to say that bonds are \"\"no longer a good idea\"\" is certainly not correct.  One could say bonds may no longer be a good idea for some people that have a particularly high risk tolerance and very high return requirements. However, to some extent, that has always been true. It is worth remembering also that there is some compelling evidence that global growth is starting to broadly slow down and many people believe that future stock returns and, in general, returns on all investments will be lower.  This is much much harder to estimate than bond returns though.  Depending on who you believe, bond returns may actually look relatively better than the have in the past. Edit in response to comment:  Corporate bond correlation with stocks is positive but generally not very strong (except for high-yield junk bonds) so while they don't offset stock volatility (negative correlation) they do help diversify a stock portfolio.  Government bonds have essentially zero correlation so they don't really offset volatility as much as just not add any.  Negative correlation assets are generally called insurance and you tend to have to pay for them.  So there is no free lunch here.  Assets that reduce risk cost money, assets that add little risk give less return and assets that are more risky tend to give more return in the long run but you can feel the pain.  The mix that is right for you depends on a lot of things, but for many people that mix involves some corporate and government bonds.\"",
            "\"The fact that some asset (in this case corporate bonds) has positive correlation with some other asset (equity) doesn't mean buying both isn't a good idea.  Unless they are perfectly correlated, the best risk/reward portfolio will include both assets as they will sometimes move in opposite directions and cancel out each other's risk.  So yes, you should buy corporate bonds.  Short-term government bonds are essentially the risk-free asset.  You will want to include that as well if you are very risk averse, otherwise you may not.  Long-term government bonds may be default free but they are not risk free.  They will make money if interest rates fall and lose if interest rates rise.  Because of that risk, they also pay you a premium, albeit a small one, and should be in your portfolio. So yes, a passive portfolio (actually, any reasonable portfolio) should strive to reduce risk by diversifying into all assets that it reasonably can.  If you believe the capital asset pricing model, the weights on portfolio assets should correspond to market weights (more money in bonds than stocks).  Otherwise you will need to choose your weights.  Unfortunately we are not able to estimate the true expected returns of risky assets, so no one can really agree on what the true optimal weights should be.  That's why there are so many rules of thumb and so much disagreement on the subject.  But there is little or no disagreement on the fact that the optimal portfolio does include risky bonds including long-term treasuries. To answer your follow-up question about an \"\"anchor,\"\" if by that you mean a risk-free asset then the answer is not really.  Any risk-free asset is paying approximately zero right now.  Some assets with very little risk will earn a very little bit more than short term treasuries, but overall there's nowhere to hide--the time value of money is extremely low at short horizons.  You want expected returns, you must take risk.\"",

            "I have had similar thoughts regarding alternative diversifiers for the reasons you mention, but for the most part they don't exist.  Gold is often mentioned, but outside of 1972-1974 when the US went off the gold standard, it hasn't been very effective in the diversification role.  Cash can help a little, but it also fails to effectively protect you in a bear market, as measured by portfolio drawdowns as well as std dev, relative to gov't bonds. There are alternative assets, reverse ETFs, etc which can fulfill a specific short term defensive role in your portfolio, but which can be very dangerous and are especially poor as a long term solution; while some people claim to use them for effective results, I haven't seen anything verifiable. I don't recommend them. Gov't bonds really do have a negative correlation to equities during periods in which equities underperform (timing is often slightly delayed), and that makes them more valuable than any other asset class as a diversifier.  If you are concerned about rate increases, avoid LT gov't bond funds.  Intermediate will work, but will take a few hits... short term bonds will be the safest.  Personally I'm in Intermediates (30%), and willing to take the modest hit, in exchange for the overall portfolio protection they provide against an equity downturn.  If the hit concerns you, Tips may provide some long term help, assuming inflation rises along with rates to some degree. I personally think Tips give up too much return when equity performance is strong, but it's a modest concern - Tips may suit you better than any other option.

Schwab, for example, offers IRAs with no administrative fees and a low minimum to open. On the other hand, an IRA with a 0.25% administrative fee is considered by the author to be excessively high. Vanguard and Fidelity are mentioned as practical options, as neither of them charges administrative fees for IRAs and they offer no-load and no-transaction-fee funds with low expenses. Vanguard funds, in particular, are highlighted for having very low fees, with many charging around 0.2% .\n\nIt should be noted that these opinions are from the author of the document and may vary depending on individual circumstances. Actual administrative fees can depend on the specific provider, the types of services offered, and the investment options available within the IRA.

The fact is, you'll have expenses for the investments, whether a commission on stock purchase or ongoing expense of a fund or ETF. But, in my opinion, .25% is criminal. An S&P fund or ETF will have a sub-.10% expense. To spend .25% before any other fees are added is just wrong.",
            "Whether or not it's reasonable is a matter of opinion, but there are certainly cheaper options out there. It does seem strange to me that your credit union charges a percentage of your assets rather than a flat fee since they shouldn't have to do any more work based on how much money you have invested. I would look into rolling over your IRA to Vanguard or Fidelity. Neither charge administrative fees, and they offer no-load and no-transaction fee funds with low expenses. If you went with Fidelity directly, you'd be bypassing the middle man (your credit union) and their additional administrative fees. Vanguard tends to offer even cheaper funds."

        "question": "How do I research, analyze, and choose the right mutual fund for a roth ira?",
        "answer": "When researching, analyzing, and choosing the right mutual fund for a Roth IRA, here are several points to consider:\n\n1. **Expense Ratios and Fees**: Mutual funds charge fees, which can range from 1% to 5%. These fees can significantly impact your investment if they are not offset by the fund's performance. Index funds and ETFs tend to have lower expense ratios, typically less than 0.50%. It\u2019s worth looking for funds with low expenses so as not to diminish your returns  .\n\n2. **Active vs. Passive Management**: Some mutual funds are actively managed, which means there's a fund manager making decisions about buying and selling stocks. These funds tend to be more expensive because of management fees, and the frequent trading can also increase tax liabilities. Research has shown that active management does not consistently outperform the market, which is why index-based funds are often recommended for their lower costs and potential for solid returns  .\n\n3. **Reading the Prospectus**: A lot of useful information can be found in a fund's prospectus. Books such as \"The Boglehead's Guide to Investing\" provide insights mostly on mutual and index funds and can help you understand important aspects of these investment vehicles  .\n\n4. **Performance History**: While it's essential to review a fund's history, remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. This is crucial to keep in mind when reviewing historical data and considering how a fund might perform in the future  .\n\n5. **Financial Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Consider the alignment of the mutual fund with your long-term financial goals and your risk tolerance. For retirement savings, you generally look for long-term growth, but you should also evaluate how comfortable you are with the investment's risk level, as investing is about finding a balance between potential gains and the risk of loss  .\n\n6. **Seeking Professional Advice**: If you're new to investing or want a second opinion, consider consulting an independent financial planner who charges by the hour, not on commission. This ensures you get unbiased advice. Financial planners who are commission-based may have incentives to sell you products that benefit them more than they benefit you  .\n\nRemember, the right mutual fund for your Roth IRA depends on your individual circumstances, including your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and investment goals. By taking the time to educate yourself and perhaps even seeking professional advice, you can make a more informed decision that suits your financial plan.",

Research has shown that people cannot predict the stock market, which is why many people suggest index based funds. An index fund generally tracks a group of companies. Example: an index fund of the S&P 500 will try to mimic the returns that the S&P 500 has. Overall, managed funds are more expensive than index funds because the fund manager must be paid to manage it. Also, there is generally more buying and selling so that also increases the tax amount you would owe. What I am planning on doing is opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard, as their funds have incredibly low fees (0.2% on many).

        "question": "How does pre-market trading work?",
        "answer": "Pre-market trading refers to buying and selling securities before the regular market trading hours, which typically run from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET). Here are some key points about how pre-market trading works:\n\n1. Not all brokers offer pre-market trading, and among those that do, the availability and rules might vary.\n\n2. During pre-market (and post-market) hours, traders can only use limit orders, in contrast to the regular hours where both market and limit orders can be used. Limit orders specify the maximum price at which you are willing to buy a stock or the minimum at which you are willing to sell.\n\n3. The reason behind the exclusive use of limit orders during pre-market trading is due to the lower liquidity compared to regular trading hours. The use of market orders in such conditions could result in trades being filled at unfavorable prices.\n\n4. Some brokers require an indication that you want your order to execute during pre-market or post-market hours, such as specifying \"Day\" for regular hours or \"Ext\" for extended hours that include pre-market, regular, and post-market.\n\n5. If an order is placed during pre-market hours with the appropriate indication (like \"Ext\"), and there is a matching order, the trade can occur in real-time during pre-market hours.\n\nFor example, if a stock is trading at $5 at 8 AM and you put in a limit order to buy it at $5 while specifying \"Ext,\" your order will execute at that time if there's a matching sell order .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"First of all, not all brokers allow trading during pre-market and post-market.  Some brokers only allow trading during the regular hours (9:30am - 4pm ET). Second of all, while you can place orders using limit orders and market orders during regular trading hours, you can only use limit orders during pre-market and post-market.  This is because the liquidity is much lower during pre-market and post-market, and using market orders could result in some trades filling at horrible prices.  So brokers don't allow using market orders outside of regular trading hours. Third, some brokers require you to specify that you want your order to be executed during pre-market or post-market.  For example, my broker allows me to specify either \"\"Day\"\" or \"\"Ext\"\" for my orders.  \"\"Day\"\" means I want my order to execute only during regular trading hours, and \"\"Ext\"\" means I want my order to execute at any time - pre-market, regular trading hours, or post-market. Finally, if your broker allows pre/post market trading, and you place a limit order while specifying \"\"Ext\"\", then your trade can happen in real-time during pre-market or post-market.  Per your example, if a stock is trading at $5 at 8am, and you put in a limit order (while specifying \"\"Ext\"\") to buy it at $5 at 8am, then your order will execute at that time and you will buy that stock at 8am.\""

        "answer": "In the United States, both dividends and capital gains from selling stock have their own tax implications and potential benefits.\n\n**Dividends:**\n- Dividends are distributed from the net profits of a company.\n- While dividends do not affect your share in the company\u2014you still own the same portion of the stock after receiving dividends\u2014they are taxed at the same rates as capital gains.\n- Dividends can offer a steady and predictable source of income, particularly useful for retirees relying on this income to match cash flow to expenses and to avoid liquidity crunches.\n- They are generally disbursed quarterly, providing a consistent cash inflow.\n\n**Selling Stock:**\n- When you sell a portion of your stock, you are liquidating your share in the company.\n- Selling stock might lead to less tax owed for the same amount of cash raised compared to dividends. This is because you might be returning some of the basis (the original value for tax purposes) and not all the sale proceeds will be considered profit.\n- Additionally, you can employ strategic tax moves such as \"loss harvesting\" to offset gains with losses and lower the overall tax burden.\n- You have more control over the timing of realizing gains, which gives flexibility in managing your tax situation.\n\nThe document indicates that there are more tax \"benefits\" to selling stock to raise income versus receiving dividends because it allows for a return of basis and provides precise control over the realization of gains . However, dividends are typically used for retirement income due to their predictability and their role in cash flow management, despite the taxation similarities with capital gains.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The benefit is not in taxes. When you sell a portion of your stock, you no longer have a portion of your stock. When you get a dividend, you still have a portion of your stock. Dividends are distributed from the net profits of a company and as such usually don't affect its growth/earning potential much (although there may be cases when they do). So while the price takes a temporary dip due to the distribution, you're likely to get the same dividends again next year, if the company continues being similarly profitable. If you sell a portion of your stock, at some point you'll end up with no more stocks to sell.",
            "\"In the US, dividends are presently taxed at the same rates as capital gains, however selling stock could lead to less tax owed for the same amount of cash raised, because you are getting a return of basis or can elect to engage in a \"\"loss harvesting\"\" strategy.

You have precise control of the realization of gains.    However, the reason dividends (or dividend funds) are used for retirement income is for matching cash flow to expenses and preventing a liquidity crunch.  One feature of retirement is that you're not working to earn a salary, yet you still have daily living expenses.   Dividends are stable and more predictable than capital gains, and generate cash generally quarterly.  While companies can reduce or suspend their dividend, you can generally budget for your portfolio to put a reliable amount of cash in your pocket on schedule.

        "question": "How do index funds actually work?",
        "answer": "Index funds operate as a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that aims to track the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P 500. Rather than actively managing the fund by buying and selling individual stocks, index funds passively manage the investment by mirroring the index's composition. This means that if a company's stock is included in an index, the index fund will hold that stock. When the index composition changes, the fund adjusts its holdings accordingly to ensure that its asset allocation continues to match the index.\n\nThe key benefits of index funds are their lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. Because index funds are passively managed, they do not require paying high fees to fund managers for stock selection. Additionally, the low turnover in holdings can lead to lower transaction costs and potentially lower taxes on capital gains due to less frequent buying and selling within the fund.\n\nHere's a detailed look at how index funds work:\n\n1. **Tracking an Index**: An index fund follows a certain index, which could be broad-based like the S&P 500 or more specialized. The fund's portfolio mirrors the constituents of the index, capturing the performance of the index as a whole.\n\n2. **Passive Management**: The fund managers of index funds do not actively pick stocks to outperform the market; instead, they focus on replicating the index's performance. This passive management approach reduces costs and simplifies the investment process. If the index methodology changes (for example, if a company is added or removed from an index), the index fund will adjust its holdings to reflect those changes.\n\n3. **Lower Costs**: Index funds typically have lower expense ratios than actively managed funds. Since the fund is not trying to outperform the index through stock selection, the costs associated with research and analysis are minimized, resulting in lower fees for investors.\n\n4. **Diversification**: By investing in an index fund, an investor gains exposure to a wide range of stocks or securities in a single investment, which can help diversify and reduce the risk associated with owning individual stocks.\n\n5. **Long-Term Investing**: Index funds are often recommended for long-term investing strategies, as they provide a way to achieve market returns with a long-term horizon, and they tend to be more tax-efficient due to lower turnover.\n\nIn essence, index funds are designed to provide a hassle-free, cost-effective method of investing that is suitable for many investors, especially those who favor a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy .",

In this kind of scenario, what does happen?  In this scenario, if that company is included in the index being tracked, you will continue holding until such time that the index is no longer including that company.   Index funds are passively managed because they simply hold the securities contained in the index and seek to keep the allocations of the fund in line with the proportions of the index being tracked.  In an actively managed fund the fund manager would try to hedge losses and make stock/security picks.  If the manager thought a particular company had bad news coming maybe they would offload some or all the position.

        "answer": "Index funds and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) have a few key differences:\n\n1. **Management Style**: Index funds, like ETFs, are considered to be passively managed because they aim to replicate the performance of a particular index. The fund manager's role in both is mainly to match the asset allocations of the index, not to pick individual stocks.\n\n2. **Trading Mechanism**: ETFs are traded on stock exchanges similar to stocks, meaning they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices. This can lead to price fluctuations based on demand and supply. Index funds, however, are not traded on an exchange and are typically bought and sold at the end of the trading day at a price based on the net asset value (NAV) which is determined after the market closes.\n\n3. **Liquidity**: Because ETFs are traded like stocks, they tend to be more liquid. Index funds may offer less liquidity since redemption might take more time.\n\n4. **Expense Ratio**: ETFs and index funds tracking the same index may differ in expense ratios, which would lead to differences in performance.\n\n5. **Tracking Error**: The tracking error refers to the discrepancy between the performance of the fund and its target index. This can differ between ETFs and index funds due to the timing of trades and other factors.\n\n6. **Investment Options**: Sophisticated investors might prefer ETFs because they allow for the use of options to hedge against market declines. Moreover, some brokers offer a suite of ETFs with no transaction fees, which can make them more cost-effective compared to index mutual funds in certain circumstances.\n\n7. **Investment Minimums and Costs**: Index funds often have minimum investment requirements and may be prone to higher transaction costs for contributions and redemptions compared to ETFs, which can be traded with no transaction costs in some cases.\n\nFor most retail investors not looking to trade actively, an index mutual fund might be a better overall value. However, ETFs can be more suitable for investors who seek flexibility and features like intra-day trading and hedging with options .",

            "Index Funds & ETFs, if they are tracking the same index, will be the same in an ideal world. The difference would be because of the following factors: Expense ratio: i.e. the expense the funds charge. This varies and hence it would lead to a difference in performance. Tracking error: this means that there is a small percentage of error between the actual index composition and the fund composition. This is due to various reasons.  Effectively this would result in the difference between values. Demand / Supply: with ETFs, the fund is traded on stock exchanges like a stock. If the general feeling is that the index is rising, it could lead to an increase in the price of the ETF. Index funds on the other hand would remain the same for the day and are less liquid. This results in a price increase / decrease depending on the market. The above explains the reason for the difference.   Regarding which one to buy, one would need to consider other factors like: a) How easy is it to buy ETFs? Do you already hold Demat A/C & access to brokers to help you conduct the transaction or do you need to open an additional account at some cost. b) Normally funds do not need any account, but are you OK with less liquidity as it would take more time to redeem funds.",
            "I think that assuming that you're not looking to trade the fund, an index Mutual Fund is a better overall value than an ETF. The cost difference is negligible, and the ability to dollar-cost average future contributions with no transaction costs. You also have to be careful with ETFs; the spreads are wide on a low-volume fund and some ETFs are going more exotic things that can burn a novice investor. Track two similar funds (say Vanguard Total Stock Market: VTSMX and Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF: VTI), you'll see that they track similarly.  If you are a more sophisticated investor, ETFs give you the ability to use options to hedge against declines in value without having to incur capital gains from the sale of the fund. (ie. 20 years from now, can use puts to make up for short-term losses instead of selling shares to avoid losses)  For most retail investors, I think you really need to justify using ETFs versus mutual funds. If anything, the limitations of mutual funds (no intra-day trading, no options, etc) discourage speculative behavior that is ultimately not in your best interest.

But the bigger volume on SPY might matter to you if you use options: open interest is as much as 1000x more on SPY. Even if you have no interest in options, the spreads on SPY are probably going to be slightly smaller. They both have 0.09% expense ratios. When I looked on 2010-9-6, SPY was trading at a slight discount, IVV was at a slight premium. Looking for any sort of trend is left as an exercise to the reader...

For European options, the odds of paying out are equal to the odds that the strike price is in the money at expiry. In contrast, for American options, the odds of paying out are equal to the odds that the strike price is in the money at expiry plus the odds that the strike price is in the money before expiry multiplied by the odds that the other party will exercise early.\n\nThis flexibility to exercise at any time before the expiry makes the American option potentially more valuable since it offers additional opportunities for profit if the underlying asset's price movement favors early exercise. The anticipation of potential early exercise has to be factored into the pricing model, leading to a higher theoretical price for American options over their European counterparts, despite the fact that early exercise is not always the optimal strategy. \n\nHowever, even if early exercise is generally considered suboptimal because it involves forgoing the time value of the option, the mere chance that it could be beneficial in certain scenarios adds to the American option's value.

This can arise in several ways, such as: An in the money (ITM) call option on a stock is often exercised just   before the stock pays a dividend that would lower its value by more   than the option's remaining time value.  A put option will usually be   exercised early if the underlying asset files for bankruptcy.[3]  A deep ITM currency option (FX option) where the strike currency has a   lower interest rate than the currency to be received will often be   exercised early because the time value sacrificed is less valuable   than the expected depreciation of the received currency against the   strike.  An American bond option on the dirty price of a bond (such as   some convertible bonds) may be exercised immediately if ITM and a   coupon is due.  A put option on gold will be exercised early when deep   ITM, because gold tends to hold its value whereas the currency used as   the strike is often expected to lose value through inflation if the   holder waits until final maturity to exercise the option (they will   almost certainly exercise a contract deep ITM, minimizing its time   value).[citation needed]"

        "question": "Do common stocks and preferred stocks have any differences in terms of percentage of the company per unit they represent?",
        "answer": "Common stocks and preferred stocks can indeed represent different percentages of the company per unit. Preferred stock may come with different benefits, including a different proportion of ownership interest compared to common stock. For instance, some share classes have preference above others in the event of a liquidation, and some share classes represent a different proportion of ownership interest. In the example provided in the document, it's illustrated how a company might go public by selling 80% of the company in common shares but retain control by creating a preferred share class with multiple votes per share, which enables the original owners to retain a majority of the voting power while owning less than half of the company's shares .\n\nTherefore, it's important to note that the proportion of ownership interest and the voting rights can be structured differently for preferred stocks when compared to common stocks. When you encounter multiple share classes, it is crucial to investigate the specific terms and differences for that corporation to understand the exact ownership and control implications of each type of share .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Typically, preferred shares come with one or both different benefits - a disproportionate share of votes, say 10 votes per share vs the normal 1, or a preferred dividend.  The vote preference is great for the owner(s) looking to go public, but not lose control of the company. Say, I am a Walton (of Walmart fame) and when I went public, I sold 80% of the (1000 share total) company. But, in creating the share structure, 20% of shares were assigned 10 votes each. 800 shares now trade with 800 votes, 200 shares have 10 votes each or 2000 votes. So, there are still the 1000 shares but 2800 votes. The 20% of shares now have 2000/2800 or 71% of the total votes. So, my shares are just less than half ownership, but over 78% of votes.  Preferred dividend is as simple as that, buy Stock A for ownership, or (same company) Stock A preferred shares which have ownership and $1/yr dividend.  Edited to show a bit more math. I use a simple example to call out a total 1000 shares. The percentages would be the same for a million or billion shares if 20% were a 10 vote preferred.",
            "Preferred stocks are, err... Preferred. The whole point of preferred stocks is that they have some preference over other classes of stocks (there may be more than 2, by the way). It can be more voting rights, more dividends or priority on dividends' distribution (common with VC investments), or priority on liquidations (in bankruptcy, preferred stock holders are ranked higher than common). Many times initial or critical investments are made on preferred terms, and the stocks are converted to common when certain thresholds are met. Obviously all these benefits require a premium on the price."

        "question": "Do stock option prices predicate the underlying stock's movement?",
        "answer": "The relationship between stock option prices and the underlying stock's movement is complex. Stock options are derivatives, meaning their value is derived from the price of an underlying asset, in this case, the stock. Options prices can be influenced by various factors, including the stock's current price, volatility, time to expiration, and interest rates, among others.\n\nOption prices do not predict the movement of the underlying stock, but they can sometimes provide insights into market sentiment. For example, if a large number of options are being bought with strike prices significantly higher than the current stock price, it might suggest that some traders expect the stock price to rise. Similarly, if there is heavy buying of put options, it might suggest that some traders expect the stock to fall.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that trading based on such indicators is speculative and not always accurate. Option prices reflect the market's expectations of future price movements, but they don't necessarily indicate where the stock price will actually go.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific study or information on the relationship between stock option prices and stock movement in the uploaded file, I can search the document for that information. Would you like me to do that?",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Options reflect expectations about the underlying asset, and options are commonly priced using the Black-Scholes model:  N(d1) and N(d2) are probability functions, S is the spot (current) price of the asset, K is the strike price, r is the risk free rate, and T-t represents time to maturity.  Without getting into the mathematics, it suffices to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset, so call options are priced lower  and put options are priced higher. Think about it intuitively. If the stock is more likely to go downwards, then there's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless, so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option.  Puts are priced similarly, but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to Put-Call parity. So if call option prices are falling, then put option prices are rising (Note, however, that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise. The inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works.) So the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower (in the given time frame). That does not mean it will go lower, and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position. Bottom line: gotta do your own homework! Best of luck.",
            "Options are an indication what a particular segment of the market (those who deal a lot in options) think will happen. (and just because people think that, doesn't mean it will)  Bearing in mind however that people writing covered-calls may due so simply as part of a strategy to mitigate downside risk at the expense of limiting upside potential.  The presence of more people offering up options is to a degree an indication they are thinking the price will fall or hold steady, since that is in effect the 'bet' they are making.  OTOH the people buying those options are making the opposite bet.. so who is to say which will be right.  The balance between the two and how it affects the price of the options could be taken as an indication of market sentiment (within the options market) as to the future direction the stock is likely to take. (I just noticed that Blackjack posted the forumula that can be used to model all of this)  To address the last part of your question 'does that mean it will go lower' I would say this.  The degree to which any of this puts actual pressure on the stock of the underlying instrument is highly debatable, since many (likely most) people trading in a stock never look at what the options for that stock are doing, but base their decision on other factors such as price history, momentum, fundamentals and recent news about the company.  To presume that actions in the options market would put pressure on a stock price, you would need to believe that a signficant fraction of the buyers and sellers were paying attention to the options market.  Which might be the case for some Quants, but likely not for a lot of other buyers.   And it could be argued even then that both groups, those trading options, and those trading stocks, are both looking at the same information to make their predictions of the likely future for the stock, and thus even if there is a correlation between what the stock price does in relation to options, there is no real causality that can be established.  We would in fact predict that given access to the same information, both groups would by and large be taking similar parallel actions due to coming to similar conclusions regarding the future price of the stock.  What is far MORE likely to pressure the price would be just the shear number of buyers or sellers, and also (especially since repeal of the uptick rule) someone who is trying to actively drive down the price via a lot of shorting at progressively lower prices.  (something that is alleged to have been carried out by some hedge fund managers in the course of 'bear raids' on particular companies)",
            "Option prices can predict the range of movement of the underlying, but not if the underlying is going up or down. An option price gives an implied volatility for an underlying . That IV number helps predict a range for the underlying price over the next few days,months, upto a year."

        "question": "How to bet against the London housing market?",
        "answer": "It seems that the document you provided is quite extensive and does not immediately provide the information on how to bet against the London housing market. I've searched through a significant portion of it without finding specific advice on this topic.\n\nBetting against any market, including the London housing market, typically involves financial instruments or strategies that benefit from a decline in asset values. Here are some general ways investors might bet against a housing market:\n\n1. **Short Selling**: This involves borrowing shares in real estate companies or funds and selling them with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. However, short selling real estate assets directly can be tricky.\n\n2. **Inverse ETFs**: These exchange-traded funds are designed to inversely track the performance of a real estate index. If the index falls, the value of the inverse ETF rises.\n\n3. **Put Options**: Buying put options on real estate stocks or ETFs allows you to profit from declines in their market price.\n\n4. **Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Derivatives**: Betting against REITs through derivatives such as CFDs (contracts for difference) or spread bets can also be a way.\n\n5. **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: These are essentially insurance contracts against the default of mortgage-backed securities. This was famously done by investors like Michael Burry before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nKeep in mind that these methods carry significant risk and require a solid understanding of the market and the instruments involved. It's also important to consider the ethical and economic implications of such investments, especially with something as fundamental as housing.\n\nIf you require the exact information from the document, please let me know, and I will continue searching the file for more information on this topic.",

            "Well, Taking a short position directly in real estate is impossible because it's not a fungible asset, so the only way to do it is to trade in its derivatives - Investment Fund Stock, indexes and commodities correlated to the real estate market (for example, materials related to construction).    It's hard to find those because real estate funds usually don't issue securities and rely on investment made directly with them. Another factor should be that those who actually do have issued securities aren't usually popular enough for dealers and Market Makers to invest in it, who make it possible to take a short position in exchange for some spread. So what you can do is, you can go through all the existing real estate funds and find out if any of them has a broker that let's you short it, in other words which one of them has securities in the financial market you can buy or sell. One other option is looking for real estate/property derivatives, like this particular example. Personally, I would try to computationally find other securities that may in some way correlate with the real estate market, even if they look a bit far fetched to be related like commodities and stock from companies in construction and real estate management, etc. and trade those because these have in most of the cases more liquidity.

        "answer": "When we discuss \"Long(100%)-Short(-100%)\" in an investment context, we are referring to a strategy where an investor takes long positions (buying securities with the expectation that they will increase in value) equal to 100% of their portfolio's base equity and short positions (selling securities they do not own with the expectation that they will be able to buy them back at a lower price) also equal to 100% of their portfolio's base equity.\n\nHere's how it works in the context of a portfolio:\n\n- If you deposit $5,000 into your account and go long (buy) and short (sell) 50%, you are long $2,500 and short $2,500.\n- If you go 100% long and -100% short, then you are long $5,000 and short $5,000.\n- Leverage, in this case, would be computed gross, meaning all positions are considered as if they were long. So with a 100% long and -100% short position, the gross exposure is considered to be twice the underlying base equity, creating what is known as \"2 to 1 leverage.\"\n\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that percentages in short positions can be tricky since they don't add up to 100% in a straightforward manner. What matters is the net total of your positions. For example, if you are long 100 shares in one stock and short 50 shares in another, then you are net long 50 shares.\n\nIn the case of mutual funds or ETFs, the percentages of long and short positions are relative to the total value of the fund's portfolio. Therefore, a fund that is 50% long in one asset and -50% short in another is not equivalent to being 100% long and -100% short in those assets due to the difference in net exposure.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that the market can remain irrational longer than an investor can stay solvent, and there are several risks associated with high leverage and maintaining short positions, such as limitations on borrowings, interest payments, and the finite amount of capital available to an investor.\n\nThese concepts are part of the broader understanding of risk management, leverage, and position sizing in investment portfolios, and need to be approached with caution and thorough analysis .",

If the long and short positions are both for the same asset, then, as D Stanley mentions, all that matters is the net position. If you're equally long and short X, then the net position is always 0%.",

They offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts as long as you meet the minimum balance requirements .\n\n2. Mutual Funds and Stock Market: If you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns, you may consider investing in mutual funds or the stock market, with long-term gains expectation around 8 - 10%. However, these investments come with a corresponding level of risk, which might not be suitable for everyone. It's important to understand your own risk adversity .\n\n3. Diversification through Currency and Precious Metals: Some experts suggest keeping your capital diversified by splitting it among different assets such as USD, EUR, and precious metals like silver. This diversification can potentially hedge against currency devaluation and broader financial instability. Silver may be preferable over gold due to the gold:silver ratio currently being high .\n\n4. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): For those who are novices in the stock market, investing in an S&P-indexed ETF might provide a reasonable return (historically 7-8% annually) at a moderate risk level.

        "question": "What does Chapter 11 Bankruptcy mean to an investor holding shares of a Chapter 11 Company?",
        "answer": "For an investor holding shares of a company that files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, the implications can be severe. When a company enters into Chapter 11, it is attempting to reorganize and renegotiate its debt obligations with the goal of returning to profitability. This often involves creditors taking full or majority ownership of the company through a debt-for-equity swap when the company emerges from Chapter 11. Consequently, the value of pre-bankruptcy equity is likely to be significantly diluted, or in many cases, shareholders may end up with nothing or only pennies on the dollar for their investment. It's rare but possible for shareholders to retain any equity after the reorganization is complete, although this varies on a case-by-case basis and can be highly complex.\n\nIt's important to note that while shares of bankrupt companies might still technically exist, they are often delisted from exchanges as the company no longer meets minimum listing requirements. If there's a market to sell the shares, investors may want to cut their losses and sell. Otherwise, they might be left holding shares with no market, with a high risk of losing everything.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that in the event of a liquidation, if the proceeds are enough to cover the debts, shareholders might receive some form of payment, although predicting the amount can be difficult and depends on the value of assets like intellectual property that need to be auctioned off.\n\nIf you're facing such a situation, it may be wise to review the full informational resources available on the subject, such as Investopedia's article \"An Overview of Corporate Bankruptcy\" or the Wikipedia entry on Chapter 11 bankruptcy. These can provide a more detailed understanding of what happens when a public company files for bankruptcy and how it affects investors, as well as clarify the \"pecking order\" of creditors and investors concerning who gets paid back and in which order .",

            "If you've got shares in a company that's filed for U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, that sucks, it really does.  I've been there before and you may lose your entire investment.  If there's still a market for your shares and you can sell them, you may want to just accept the loss and get out with what you can. However, shares of bankrupt companies are often delisted once bankrupt, since the company no longer meets minimum exchange listing requirements.  If you're stuck holding shares with no market, you could lose everything \u2013 but that's not always the case: Chapter 11 isn't total and final bankruptcy where the company ceases to exist after liquidation of its assets to pay off its debts.  Rather, Chapter 11 is a section of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that permits a company to attempt to reorganize (or renegotiate) its debt obligations. During Chapter 11 reorganization, a company can negotiate with its creditors for a better arrangement.  They typically need to demonstrate to creditors that without the burden of the heavy debt, they could achieve profitability.  Such reorganization often involves creditors taking complete or majority ownership of the company when it emerges from Chapter 11 through a debt-for-equity swap. That's why you, as an investor before the bankruptcy, are very likely to get nothing or just pennies on the dollar. Any equity you may be left holding will be considerably diluted in value.  It's rare that shareholders before a Chapter 11 bankruptcy still retain any equity after the company emerges from Chapter 11, but it is possible. But it varies from bankruptcy to bankruptcy and it can be complex as montyloree pointed out. Investopedia has a great article: An Overview of Corporate Bankruptcy.  Here's an excerpt: If a company you've got a stake in   files for bankruptcy, chances are   you'll get back pennies to the dollar.   Different bankruptcy proceedings or   filings generally give some idea as to   whether the average investor will get   back all or a portion of his   investment, but even that is   determined on a case-by-case basis.   There is also a pecking order of   creditors and investors of who get   paid back first, second and last. In   this article, we'll explain what   happens when a public company files   for protection under U.S. bankruptcy   laws and how it affects investors.   [...]   How It Affects Investors   [...]   When your company goes bankrupt, there   is a very good chance you will not get   back the full value of your   investment. In fact, there is a chance   you won't get anything back. [...] Wikipedia has a good article on Chapter 11 bankruptcy at Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code.",
            "\"I held shares in BIND Therapeutics, a small biotechnology company on the NASDAQ that was liquidated on the chapter 11 auction block in 2016. There were sufficient proceeds to pay the debts and return some cash to shareholders, with payments in 2016 and 2017. (Some payments have yet to occur.) The whole process is counter-intuitive and full of landmines, both for tax preparation & planning and receiving payments: Landmine 0: Some shareholders will sell in a panic as soon as the chapter 11 is announced.  This would have been a huge mistake in the case of BIND, because the eventual liquidation payments were worth 3 or so times as much as the share price after chapter 11.  The amount of the liquidation payments wasn't immediately calculable, because the company's intellectual property had to be auctioned. Landmine 1: The large brokerages (Vanguard, Fidelity, TDA, and others) mischaracterized the distributions to shareholders on form 1099, distributed to both shareholders and the IRS. The bankruptcy trustee considered this to be their responsibility. According to the tax code and to the IRS website, the liquidation is taxed like a sale of stock, rather than a dividend. \"\"On the shareholder level, a complete liquidation can be thought of as a sale of all outstanding corporate stock held by the shareholders in exchange for all of the assets in that corporation. Like any sale of stock, the shareholder receives capital gain treatment on the difference between the amount received by the shareholder in the distribution and the cost or other basis of the stock.\"\" Mischaracterizing the distributions as dividends makes them wrongly ineligible to be wiped out by the enormous capital loss on the stock.  Vanguard's error appeared on my own 1099, and the others were mentioned in an investor discussion on stocktwits.  However, Geoffrey L Berman, the bankruptcy trustee stated on twitter that while the payments are NOT dividends, the 1099s were the brokers' responsibility. Landmine 2: Many shareholders will wrongly attempt to claim the capital loss for tax year 2016, or they may have failed to understand the law in time for proper tax planning for tax year 2016. It does not matter that the company's BINDQ shares were cancelled in 2016.  According to the IRS website \"\"When a shareholder receives a series of distributions in liquidation, gain is recognized once all of the shareholder's stock basis is recovered. A loss, however, will not be recognized until the final distribution is received.\"\" In particular, shareholders who receive the 2017 payment will not be able to take a capital loss for tax year 2016 because the liquidation wasn't complete.  Late discovery of this timing issue no doubt resulted in an end-of-year underestimation of 2016 overall capital gains for many, causing a failure to preemptively realize available capital losses elsewhere. I'm not going to carefully consider the following issues, which may or may not have some effect on the timing of the capital loss: Landmine 3: Surprisingly, it appears that some shareholders who sold their shares in 2016 still may not claim the capital loss for tax year 2016, because they will receive a liquidation distribution in 2017. Taken at face value, the IRS website's statement \"\"A loss, however, will not be recognized until the final distribution is received\"\" appears to apply to shareholders of record of August 30, 2016, who receive the payouts, even if they sold the shares after the record date.  However, to know for sure it might be worth carefully parsing the relevant tax code and treasury regs. Landmine 4: Some shareholders are completely cut out of the bankruptcy distribution. The bankruptcy plan only provides distributions for shareholders of record Aug 30, 2016.  Those who bought shares of BINDQ afterwards are out of luck. Landmine 5: According to the discussion on stocktwits, many shareholders have yet to receive or even learn of the existence of a form [more secure link showing brokers served here] required to accept 2017 payments.  To add to confusion there is apparently ongoing legal wrangling over whether the trustee is able to require this form. Worse, shareholders report difficulty getting brokers' required cooperation in submitting this form. Landmine 6: Hopefully there are no more landmines. Boom. DISCLAIMER: I am not a tax professional. Consult the tax code/treasury regulations/IRS publications when preparing your taxes.  They are more trustworthy than accountants, or at least more trustworthy than good ones.\""

        "question": "Investing in commodities, pros and cons?",
        "answer": "Investing in commodities has both advantages and disadvantages. Here's what was found in the uploaded document regarding this topic:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. **Diversification**: Commodities often exhibit low correlation with stocks and bonds, which can provide diversification benefits to an investment portfolio, especially over shorter periods  .\n2. **Hedge Against Inflation**: The long-term return from commodities should, by definition, align roughly with the inflation rate, which can protect purchasing power  .\n\n**Cons:**\n1. **Complexity**: Trading in commodities can be very complex and expensive. For instance, futures need to be rolled forward, which entails managing roll premiums and potentially high transaction costs  .\n2. **Delivery Risk**: There is the risk of accidentally taking physical delivery of the commodity, which can be logistically challenging and costly  .\n3. **Low Long-Term Returns**: Compared to stocks and bonds, commodities tend to offer returns that are roughly equivalent to the inflation rate over the long term, which may be lower than what can be achieved with other asset classes  .\n4. **Valuation Challenges**: Commodities do not generate cash flows, which makes any valuation speculative and less grounded in fundamental financial analysis compared to stocks, bonds, or real estate  .\n\nThe document suggests that while there are diversification advantages to holding commodities, particularly in the case of assets like gold with low/negative correlation with stocks, these benefits might not always outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore, investing in commodities is not generally recommended for most individual investors, but may be considered part of a broader tactical or algorithmic trading strategy or longer-term investments in commodities-related equities  .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "The main advantage of commodities to a largely stock and bond portfolio is diversification and the main disadvantages are investment complexity and low long-term returns. Let's start with the advantage.  Major commodities indices and the single commodities tend to be uncorrelated to stocks and bonds and will in general be diversifying especially over short periods.  This relationship can be complex though as Supply can be even more complicated (think weather) so diversification may or may not work in your favor over long periods. However, trading in commodities can be very complex and expensive.  Futures need to be rolled forward to keep an investment going.  You really, really don't want to accidentally take delivery of 40000 pounds of cattle.  Also, you need to properly take into account roll premiums (carry) when choosing the closing date for a future.  This can be made easier by using commodities index ETFs but they can also have issues with rolling and generally have higher fees than stock index ETFs. Most importantly, it is worth understanding that the long-term return from commodities should be by definition (roughly) the inflation rate.  With stocks and bonds you expect to make more than inflation over the long term.  This is why many large institutions talk about commodities in their portfolio they often actually mean either short term tactical/algorithmic trading or long term investments in stocks closely tied to commodities production or processing. The two disadvantages above are why commodities are not recommended for most individual investors.",
            "Another disadvantage is the inability to value commodities in an accounting sense. In contrast with stocks, bonds and real estate, commodities don't generate cash flows and so any valuation methodology is by definition speculative. But as rhaskett notes, there are diversification advantages. The returns for gold, for instance, tend to exhibit low/negative correlation with the performance of stocks. The question is whether the diversification advantage, which is the primary reason to hold commodities in a multi-asset class portfolio through time, overcomes the disadvantages? The answer... maybe."

        "question": "Employer rollover from 403b to 401k?",
        "answer": "You can move money from a 403b to a 401k plan. However, whether or not this is a wise decision depends on specific circumstances or reasons. For example, if your new employer's 401k plan offers the opportunity to buy your employer's stock at discounted rates and it is considered a good investment, then you may consider the rollover. Nonetheless, it is often better to roll over the 403b money into an IRA, where you generally have more investment choices and the potential for lower investment costs, such as mutual fund fees. Additionally, 401k assets have better protection against court rulings in case of a lawsuit, as the plaintiff cannot claim these assets if you're unable to pay damages.\n\nTo proceed with a rollover, you need to speak with the HR department at your current employer to ensure they are willing to accept a rollover from another tax-deferred plan, since not all plans are amenable to this. If they agree, collect the necessary paperwork, particularly information about where the rollover check should be sent and to whom it should be made payable. Subsequently, coordinate with your previous employer's HR personnel to commence the rollover of your 403b funds into the 401k plan of your new employer. Ensure all the paperwork is filled out accurately and they know the correct details for sending out the check.\n\nAfter the rollover is complete, you should expect to receive a 1099-R form from your 403b plan the following January, indicating the amount transferred to the new custodian, and it should ideally carry the correct code showing that the money was rolled over into another tax-deferred account .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"403b plans are used by school districts, colleges and universities, nonprofit hospitals, charitable foundations and the like for their employees while 401k plans are used by most everybody else. I would suspect that a school district etc can use a 401k plan instead of a 403b plan if it chooses to do so, but the reverse direction is most likely forbidden: a (for-profit) company cannot use a 403b plan. One difference between a 403b plan and a 401k plan is that the employer can choose to offer, and the employee can choose to purchase, stock in the company inside the 401k plan. This option obviously is not available to charities etc. which don't issue stock. Your comment that the 403b plan invests solely in (variable) annuities suggests that the plan administrator is an insurance company  and that the employer is moving to more \"\"modern\"\" version that allows investments in mutual funds and the like. Forty years ago, my 403b plan was like that; the only investment choice was an annuity, but some time in the 1980s, the investment choices were broadened to include mutual funds (possibly because the 1986 Tax Reform Act changed the rules governing 403b plans).  So, are you sure that your employer is changing from a 403b plan to a 401k plan, or is it just a change of 403b plan administrator from the insurance company to another administrator who offers investment choices other than an annuity? Note, of course, that insurance companies have changed their options too. For example, TIAA (the Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Association) which was the 403b plan administrator for many schools and colleges became TIAA/CREF (College Retirement Equities Fund) where the CREF mutual funds actually were pretty good investments.\""

        "question": "What is the best way to invest in gold as a hedge against inflation without having to hold physical gold?",
        "answer": "Investing in gold as a hedge against inflation without holding the physical metal can be done through a variety of financial instruments. Here are some of the best options:\n\n1. **Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**: Buying a gold ETF is similar to buying a stock. They are traded on the stock exchange and offer the ease of trading combined with the performance of the gold price. Examples include the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and the ETF of mining companies like GDX .\n\n2. **Gold Mining Stocks**: You can buy shares in companies that mine gold, like Randgold Resources (GOLD) .\n\n3. **CEF (Central Fund of Canada)**: Another option is the Central Fund of Canada, which is a mixed fund holding both gold and silver, and trades on the stock market. This fund offers tax advantages and holds physical metals in distributed vaults. It also provides higher liquidity and low spreads between bid and ask prices .\n\n4. **Vaulted Gold**: This option involves buying gold and having it stored in a recognized vault. You own the actual gold bars, which are numbered, and you theoretically have the option to visit or remove your gold. This differs from owning paper gold through an ETF, as you actually have gold allocated to you, though you do have to pay a storage fee .\n\nPlease note, one should also consider that investing in ETFs like GLD might be more suited for speculation than as a hedge against serious inflation since in the event of severe inflation, a divergence in the price of physical gold and GLD might occur. This could lead to physical gold offering better protection against inflation compared to its equivalent ETF .\n\nIt's important to research and understand the risks and costs associated with each option to determine which investment best suits your financial goals and comfort level with risk. Keep in mind that any type of investment can be affected by market fluctuations and there are no guaranteed outcomes. Before making any investment, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"GLD, IAU, and SGOL are three different ETF's that you can invest in if you want to invest in gold without physically owning gold. Purchasing an ETF is just like purchasing a stock, so you're fine on that front.  Another alternative is to buy shares of companies that mine gold. An example of a single company is Randgold Resources (GOLD), and an ETF of mining companies is GDX. There are also some more complex alternatives like Exchange traded notes and futures contracts, but I wouldn't classify those for the \"\"regular person.\"\"  Hope it helps!\"",
            "Since GLD is priced as 1/10 oz of gold, I'd call it the preferred way to buy if that's your desire. I believe gold is entering classic bubble territory. Caveat emptor.  A comment brought me back to this question. My answer still applies, the ETF the best way to buy gold at the lowest transaction cost. The day I posted and expressed my 'bubble' concern, gold was $1746. Today, nearly 5 years later, it's $1350, a drop of 23%, plus an additional 2% of accumulated expenses. Note, GLD has a .4% annual expense. On the other hand, the S&P is up 80% from that time. In other words, $10K invested that day would be worth less than $7,700 had it been invested in gold, and $18,000 in stock. It would take a market crash, gold soaring or some combination of the two for gold to have been the right choice then. No one can predict short term movement of either the market or metals, my answer here wasn't prescient, just lucky.",
            "\"Definitely look at CEF.   They have tax advantages over GLD and SLV, and have been around for 50 years, and are a Canadian company.  They hold their gold in 5 distributed vaults. Apparently tax advantage comes because with GLD, if you supposedly approach them with enough money, you can take out a \"\"bar of gold\"\".  Just one problem (well, perhaps more): a bar of gold is an enormous sum of money (and as such not very liquid), and apparently gold bars have special certifications and tracking, which one would mess up if one took it to there personal collection, costing additional sums to re-certify. many, many articles on the web claiming that the gold GLD has is highly leveraged, is held by someone else, and tons of other things that makes GLD seem semi-dubious. I've used CEF for years, talked to them quite a few times; to me, and short of having it my possession, they seem the best /safest / easiest alternative, and are highly liquid/low spread betwen bid and ask. The do also have a pure gold \"\"stock\"\" and a pure silver \"\"stock\"\", but these often trade at higher premiums.  CEF's premium varies between -2% and +4%.   I.e. sometimes it trades at a premium to the gold and silver it holds, sometimes at a discount.  Note that CEF generally shoots to have a 50/50 ratio of gold / silver holdings in their possession/vaults, but this ratio has increased to be heavier gold weighted than silver, as silver has not performed quite as well lately.  You can go to their web-site and see exactly what they have, e.g. their NAV page:  http://www.centralfund.com/Nav%20Form.htm\"",
            "\"Investing in gold without having physical gold is not really a hedge against inflation. GLD is really more for speculation, not protection against serious inflation. If there is any kind of inflation worth really protecting yourself against then one thing you will notice at its onset is a divergence in the price of physical and GLD; with GLD offering very little protection if any against inflation. Ultimately holders of GLD will demand physical metal and the physical price will rise and the paper price will fall. I would advise you to study physical gold before you purchase GLD for that reason. EDIT: Just adding this to my answer - I don't know why I didn't put it in before, and I hasten to add that I'm not an expert though a little investigation will show you that this is at least one option for owning gold. If you think of having the physical gold yourself at one end of the spectrum and buying GLD at the other; so that you don't need to take physical delivery, there is another scenario which I understand is in between (and sorry I don't actually know what it's referred to as) but it's where you buy the physical gold but instead of taking delivery the bars are stored for you in a vault - these bars are numbered and you actually own what you have paid for and theoretically you could go and visit your gold and actually remove it because it's your gold - as opposed to having paper GLD which in my understanding is a \"\"right to take physical delivery\"\" of gold - and this is slightly different - of course unlike GLD you actually have to pay a storage fee and of course unlike having the physical gold buried in your garden or something you are not entirely secure against say a robbery of the vault, and you are also depending on the company not to sell the same bar to more than one person - but that's the only think that their reputation is built on, and a company like that would live or die by the reputation - ( and of course you might lose the proverbial gold buried in the garden either, so nothing's 100% secure anyway really )\""

        "answer": "As a US citizen holding EWU or other UK ETFs, you will need to manage the tax implications related to dividends, interest, distributions, or realized capital gains yourself, because US stockbrokers do not normally withhold taxes on these items. It's important to know that you may be required to apply backup withholding to dividends and interest. You are typically required to pay most of your tax during the year by withholding and/or making estimated tax payments. This amount is defined as within 10% of your owed tax or $1000, whichever is more.\n\nIf you anticipate that the tax on your income, including any gains from your investments, will exceed your withholding by more than the 10% or $1000 threshold, you should adjust your withholding accordingly or make an estimated payment, or a combination of both. Even if you are employed, if it's late in the year (such as the last week of December), it could be too late to adjust withholding significantly or to make a timely estimated payment if you are considering the tax quarters defined for U.S. tax purposes (January-March, April-May, June-August, and September-December).\n\nHowever, there is a 'safe harbor' rule for first-time capital gains situations. If you did not owe any income tax last year and you are either a citizen or resident, or if your withholding and estimated payments for the current year are enough to cover last year's tax liability, you are exempt from the penalty for underpayment of estimated tax. This means you could have until the tax filing deadline to pay without incurring penalties.\n\nPlease visit the IRS website for small businesses and self-employed section on estimated taxes and refer to Publication 505 for detailed information on estimated taxes: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes",

        "question": "Why does Charles Schwab have a Mandatory Settlement Period after selling stocks?",
        "answer": "Charles Schwab, like other brokers, adheres to a mandatory settlement period after selling stocks due to regulatory and operational reasons. This period is the time required for the funds to be transferred from the buyer to the broker, and then to the seller after a trade is executed.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this settlement period is to ensure that Schwab receives the funds from the other side of the transaction before giving the seller access to them. If Schwab were to release funds immediately, it would essentially be providing a loan to the seller until the deal fully settles and the funds and securities have officially changed hands .\n\nAnother aspect is the coordination that takes place behind the scenes of a security transaction. It involves various parties and clearing systems, which require time to confirm and process the transfer of ownership and funds. This logistical process is not instantaneous and necessitates the settlement period to ensure everything is settled correctly .\n\nAdditionally, while some may argue that Charles Schwab could be benefiting from holding the funds during the settlement period, as financial institutions once did in Europe with bank to bank transfers, the settlement period remains a standard practice set by most securities exchanges and is regulated by entities like the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) .\n\nIt's also worth noting that faster settlement periods are technically possible, as demonstrated by same-day transfers becoming the norm after regulatory changes in Europe. However, internationally, the standard remains T+3, meaning trades complete three days after the transaction occurs .\n\nMoreover, the settlement process for cash equity trades can be quite complex, involving multiple counterparties and a large volume of transactions that need to be squared off. The industry operates on systems that require this period to ensure accurate and efficient processing of all the different trades happening simultaneously .\n\nFor those looking to avoid the settlement period, it's possible to open a margin account, which allows immediately using the funds from a sale to make other purchases, albeit at the risk of amplifying potential losses .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "It's important to understand that, in general, security transactions involve you and a relatively unknown entity with your broker standing in the middle.  When you sell through Schwab, Schwab needs to receive the funds from the other side of the transaction.  If Schwab gave you access to the funds immediately, it would essentially be a loan until the transaction settles after funds and securities change hands.   If Schwab made funds available to you as soon as they were received, it might still be two days until the money is received; because the other side also has three days. Guaranteed one day settlement would have to include receipt of funds from the buyer in one day and Schwab can't control that. You need to remember this transaction likely includes at least one party in addition to you and Schwab.  Here's the SEC page related to the three day settlement period,  About Settling Trades in Three Days:  T+3",
            "Another explanation is that they keep your money three days to make money with it, because they can. The other reasons might have been valid 100 years ago, and no bank would voluntarily cut that down until forced by law. Example: In Europe, bank to bank transfers used to take three days, until a law forced them to give next day, and suddenly it was possible.",
            "quid's answer explains the settlement period well. However, it should be noted that you can avoid the settlement period by opening a margin account. Any specific broker like Schwab may or may not offer margin accounts. Margin accounts allow you to borrow money to avoid the settlement period or to buy more securities than you can actually afford. Note that if you buy more securities than you can afford using margin, you expose yourself to losses potentially larger than your initial investment. If you fund your account with $50,000 and use margin to purchase $80,000 of stock which then drops in value by 80% you will have lost $64,000 and owe the broker $14,000 plus fees.",

        "question": "Why diversify stocks/investments?",
        "answer": "The concept of diversifying stocks and investments serves multiple purposes in managing risk and potential returns. Here's a breakdown of reasons for diversification based on the document provided:\n\n1. **Risk Reduction**: Diversifying your investments across a range of different assets or stocks can help reduce the risk of big losses. For instance, if you had all your money in one company, such as Theranos in 2014, and it fails as it did in 2016, you would lose everything. Diversification means you wouldn't lose all your investments in such a scenario .\n\n2. **Lower Volatility**: When you have a diversified portfolio, you're betting on several different outcomes rather than just one. This means that your portfolio is less likely to experience extreme fluctuations since the performance of individual investments can offset each other. This principle can be explained using the analogy of coin flips, as increased numbers of coin flips reduce the probability of extreme outcomes .\n\n3. **Positive-Sum Game**: Unlike gambling, the stock market is a positive-sum game because companies provide returns to their shareholders through profits. Index funds, for example, aim to capture the average results of a wide range of stocks, typically leading to a profit over time without the chance of doubling money overnight or wiping out completely .\n\n4. **Tax Management**: Diversification can be strategic for tax purposes. By holding a range of investments, it might be possible to realize losses in some stocks (often towards the end of the year) to offset taxable gains and reduce the overall tax bill .\n\n5. **Protection from Unforeseen Circumstances**: No matter how much research you do, investments are always exposed to unpredictable external factors such as natural disasters, economic shifts, or fraud. Diversification helps provide some protection from total loss if a particular sector or company is adversely affected by such events .\n\n6. **Balancing Risk and Reward**: Diversification is about finding a balance between risk and reward. While it can prevent you from making hefty profits in a short period, it also averages down your profits and protects against significant losses. Index funds often outperform actively managed funds when management fees are taken into account because of this principle .\n\n7. **Investing for the Long Term**: Diversification is often seen as a long-term investment strategy, where the goal is to steadily grow assets by reinvesting dividends, and benefiting from compound interest and tax-efficient rebalancing. It's seen as a more stable approach, particularly for investors who want to avoid the risks associated with timing the market .\n\nIn summary, diversification is a fundamental strategy in investment to manage risk, reduce volatility, and potentially increase returns over time, as well as to benefit from strategic tax management. It also serves as protection against the unforeseeable aspects of individual investments.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Basically, diversifying narrows the spread of possible results, raising  the center of the returns bell-curve by reducing the likelihood of extreme results at either the high or low end.  It's largely a matter of basic statistics. Bet double-or-nothing on a single coin flip, and those are the only possible results, and your odds of a disaster (losing most or all of the money) are 50%. Bet half of it on each of two coin flips, and your odds of losing are reduced to 25% at the cost of reducing your odds of winning to 25%, with 50% odds that you retain your money and can try the game again. Three coins divides the space further; the extremes are reduced to 12.5% each, with the middle being most likely. If that was all there was, this would be a zero-sum game and pure gambling. But the stock market is actually positive-sum, since companies are delivering part of their profits to their stockholder owners. This moves the center of the bell curve up a bit from break-even, historically to about +8%. This is why index funds produce a profit with very little active decision; they treat the variation as mostly random (which seems to work statistically) and just try to capture average results of a (hopefully) slightly above-average bucket of stocks and/or bonds. This approach is boring. It will never double your money overnight. On the other hand, it will never wipe you out overnight. If you have patience and are willing to let compound interest work for you, and trust that most market swings regress to the mean in the long run, it quietly builds your savings while not driving you crazy worrying about it. If all you are looking for is better return than the banks, and you have a reasonable amount of time before you need to pull the funds out, it's one of the more reliably predictable risk/reward trade-off points. You may want to refine this by biasing the mix of what you're holding. The simplest adjustment is how much you keep in each of several major investment categories. Large cap stocks, small cap stocks, bonds, and real estate (in the form of REITs) each have different baseline risk/return curves, and move in different ways in response to news, so maintaining a selected ratio between these buckets and adding the resulting curves together is one simple way to make fairly predictable adjustments to the width (and centerline) of the total bell curve. If you think you can do better than this, go for it. But index funds have been outperforming professionally managed funds (after the management fees are accounted for), and unless you are interested in spending a lot of time researching and playing with your money the odds of your doing much better aren't great unless you're willing to risk doing much worse. For me, boring is good. I want my savings to work for me rather than the other way around, and I don't consider the market at all interesting as a game. Others will feel differently.",
            "Diversifying is the first advice given to beginner in order to avoid big loss. For example in 2014 the company Theranos was really appealing before it fail in 2016. So a beginner could have invest ALL his money and lose it. But if he has deverified he wouldn't lost everything. As an investor goes from beginner to experience some still Diversify and other concentrate. Mostly it depends how much confident you are about an investement. If you have 20 years of experience, now everything about the company and you are sure there will be profit you can concentrate. If you are not 100% sure there will be a profit, it is better to Diversify. Diversifying can also be profitating when you loose money: because you will pay tax when you earn money, if you diversify you can choose to loose money in some stock (usually in december) and in this way cut your taxes.",
            "Any investor can make a bad bet, even Buffett. Even if you have done every bit of research on an investment possible you are exposed to random external events.. acts of god, and outright fraud.",
            "Diversification is used by many to hopefully reduce the risk when bad investments are made. Diversification does not help you make more profits but instead averages down your profits. There is no way one can tell whether a stock or portfolio of stocks will go up or down once they are purchased. In order to try to provide some protection against total loss of the portfolio, a lazy so called long term investor will use diversification as a way of risk management. But the best outcome for them will be an averaging down of their profits. A better method is to let the market tell you when your purchased investment is a bad one and get out of that investment early and thus limiting your losses, whilst letting your good investments (as determined by the market) run and make larger profits."

        "question": "How to minimise the risk of a reduction in purchase power in case of Brexit for money held in a bank account?",
        "answer": "To minimize the risk of a reduction in purchasing power for money held in a bank account due to Brexit, you might consider diversifying your portfolio. This can include investing in assets such as large cap stocks, small cap stocks, bonds, and real estate through REITs, as different assets respond differently to market changes. Index funds are also recommended as they have been known to outperform professionally managed funds when management fees are accounted for .\n\nConsidering currency fluctuations due to Brexit, the GBP has already lost value simply due to the fear of Brexit, and an actual Brexit might not change the value of GBP as drastically as anticipated. If you're particularly concerned, one strategy is to convert your cash from Sterling into a more resilient foreign currency, such as the US Dollar, while being mindful of any charges for moving your money. This can potentially protect your funds from devaluation due to falling Sterling value if Brexit occurs. However, it's essential to be aware that you will likely want to convert back into Sterling when the situation stabilizes, so it is important to be mindful of costs associated with currency conversion both ways .\n\nAnother suggestion is to consider low-risk investment options such as the corporate bond market or investment-grade bonds. There are Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) available that can help diversify risk further. It is also advisable to invest in products that you fully understand and to consider the potential risks associated with any financial products, including bank accounts, TIPS, bond investments, or others .\n\nIn terms of bank account choices, it's essential to read the fine print and understand any special features or risks that come with specific accounts, such as those tied to currency exchange rates or stock market performance. For example, some special savings account offers may have risks if the currency declines or requires an understanding of complex financial instruments .\n\nRemember that financial decisions should be made based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and a thorough understanding of the potential risks and rewards. If necessary, it is advisable to seek advice from a financial advisor.",

Based on my experience on the stock markets (I am not a currency trader) I would expect the pound to fall fairly sharply on a vote for Brexit and the Euro to do the same.  Both would probably rebound quite quickly too as even if there is a Brexit vote it doesn't mean the UK Government will honour the outcome or take the steps quickly. ** I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND HAVE NO QUALIFICATIONS AS SUCH **"

        "answer": "As an F-1 student looking to invest in foreign markets, there are several important factors and regulations you should be aware of.\n\nFirstly, you should be aware of the risks inherent in any investment product. Whether you are considering stocks, bonds, or more complex products like dual currency accounts, it is crucial to fully understand the instrument's risk profile and how it operates. For example, some special savings accounts linked to stock performance may carry hidden risks, as explained with the example of Hong Kong banks offering products that are tied to the performance of a stock or country's stock index .\n\nAdditionally, if you are a US citizen or resident for tax purposes, you must comply with the United States' tax rules and regulations regarding foreign accounts. One important regulation is the requirement to file IRS Form TD F 90-22.1 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts or FBAR) if you have over $10,000 in foreign accounts at any time during the calendar year. Moreover, you should be informed about the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which imposes strict oversight on foreign accounts held by US persons .\n\nIt's also noteworthy that the dynamics of investing in different markets can vary significantly. For instance, while the US has historically been viewed as a stable investment environment, perceptions are changing, and other countries may appear risky or less familiar to US-based investors. This, in turn, affects the composition of financial products such as target date retirement funds, which may exhibit a bias toward US stocks .\n\nAs an investor based outside the US, you should carefully consider your approach to investing in US equities and whether to prioritize low expense ratios or active management, particularly when dealing with emerging markets. Constructing a well-diversified world portfolio requires careful consideration and understanding of the underlying indexes that ETFs are pegged to .\n\nBefore making any investment decisions, it is advisable to conduct thorough research and seek advice from financial advisors to ensure compliance with the relevant regulations and understand the full spectrum of risk associated with various investment vehicles.",

        "question": "What does a high operating margin but a small but positive ROE imply about a company?",
        "answer": "A high operating margin indicates that a company is efficient in managing its operations and is able to generate a significant profit above the costs of running the company and generating sales. On the other hand, a small but positive Return on Equity (ROE) suggests that while the company is profitable relative to shareholders' equity, the level of profit is modest. \n\nThe coexistence of a high operating margin with a small ROE could imply several situations:\n1. The company might be heavily financed through debt rather than equity. Since ROE measures profitability as a ratio of net income to shareholders' equity, a large debt burden would reduce ROE despite high operational profits.\n2. The company may have a large amount of equity, which dilutes the earnings attributable to each share, thus resulting in a lower ROE.\n3. There could be non-operational factors affecting net income negatively, which would lower ROE despite higher profits from operating activities.\n4. The company might be in an investment phase, reinvesting a significant portion of its earnings back into the business, which affects the net income in the short term while aiming for long-term growth.\n\nIt is also mentioned in the document that if a company has a small ROE, it might also have a quite large Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This could be caused by the company's stock being bid up in relation to its earnings, which may not be a bad thing as people may expect the high operating margin to help drive increased revenues in the future and are willing to pay a higher price now for when that day comes .",

        "question": "How are various types of income taxed differently in the USA?",
        "answer": "In the USA, various types of income are taxed differently:\n\n1. Earned Income: This includes wages, salaries, tips, cash bonuses, and other taxable employee pay, as well as earnings from self-employment. Earned income is subject to payroll taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare taxes. It is also subject to income taxes, which have seven different rates, with the amount taxed at each rate depending on the individual's earnings minus any tax credits, exemptions, or deductions. The tax rates for earned income are progressive, ranging from 10% for the first portion of income up to 39.6% for any income above a certain threshold .\n\n2. Ordinary Income: This category encompasses interest, ordinary dividends, short-term capital gains, retirement income (such as pensions, distributions from tax-deferred accounts, and Social Security), unemployment benefits, worker's compensation, alimony/child support, and S-Corp pass-through income. Ordinary income is generally taxed the same as earned income, but it is not subject to Social Security taxes. It includes items like interest earned in a bank account and non-qualified dividends .\n\n3. Long-term Capital Gains: Income from assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and carried interest that have increased in value while being held for more than a year falls under this category. The rationale behind lower tax rates for long-term capital gains is to incentivize individuals to make long-term investments in such assets. Long-term capital gains are taxed at different rates depending on your income level. If you're in the 10% or 15% income tax brackets, long-term capital gains are taxed at 0%. For higher brackets, the rates are 15% or 20% .\n\n4. Short-term Capital Gains: Unlike long-term capital gains, income from buying and selling assets held for less than a year is taxed as ordinary income after accounting for all gains and losses during the year .\n\n5. Collectibles: If held for more than a year, collectibles are not considered capital assets and are still taxed at ordinary income rates .\n\n6. Qualified Dividends: These are taxed at rates similar to long-term capital gains, assuming they come from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations and that the shares have been held for a specified period of time before the dividend was declared .\n\nPlease note that this information is based on the standards provided in the document, which cites tax rates and brackets as of 2017. Tax laws can change, so for the most current tax rates and brackets, it would be necessary to consult the latest tax code or a tax professional. Additionally, certain types of investment income for higher-income taxpayers are subject to the Net Investment Income Tax, which came about through the Affordable Care Act, but could be subject to repeal by future legislation .\n\nFinally, other taxes such as state and local income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes may apply at various levels of government and could impact the overall tax liability for different types of income .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"Long-term capital gains, which is often the main element of investment income for investors who are not high-frequency day traders, are taxed at a single rate that is often substantially below the marginal rate they would otherwise be taxed at, particularly for wealthy individuals. There are a few rationales behind this treatment; the two most common are that the government wants to encourage long-term investments (as opposed to short-term speculation), and that capital gains are a kind of double taxation (from one point of view) as they are coming from income that has already been taxed once before (as wage or ordinary income).  The latter in particular is highly controversial, but this is one of the more divisive political issues in the taxation front - one party would eliminate the tax entirely, the other would eliminate the difference. For most individuals, the majority of their long-term capital gains are taxed at 15% up to almost half of a million dollars total AGI, which is a fairly low rate - it's equivalent to the rate a taxpayer would pay on up to $37,000 in wage income (after deductions/exemptions/etc.).  You can see from this table in Wikipedia that it is much preferred to pay long-term capital gains rates when possible - at every point it's at least 10% lower than the tax rate for ordinary income. Ordinary income includes wages and many other sources of income - basically, anything that is not long term capital gains. Wage income is taxed at this rate, and also subject to some non-income-tax taxes (FICA and Medicare in particular); other sources of ordinary income are not subject to those taxes (including IRA income).  Short term capital gains are generally included in this bucket. Qualified Dividends are treated similarly to long-term capital gains (as they are of a similar nature), and taxed accordingly. The \"\"Net Investment Tax\"\" is basically applying the Medicare tax to investment income for higher-income taxpayers ($125k single, $250k joint).  It's on top of capital gains rates for them.  It came about through the Affordable Care Act, and is one of the first provisions likely to be repealed by the new Congress (as it can be repealed through the budgeting provision).  It seems likely that 2017 taxes will not contain this provision.\"",

There are 7 tax rates that get progressively larger as your income rises but only applies to the income in each bracket. 10% for the first 18,650 (2017) through 39.6% for any income above 470,700. The full list of rates is in the above linked article about payroll taxes. Earned income is required for contributions to an IRA. You cannot contribute more to an IRA than you have earned in a given year. Interest, Ordinary Dividends, Short-term Capital Gains, Retirement income (pensions, distributions from tax deferred accounts, social security), Unemployment benefits, Worker's Compensation, Alimony/Child support, Income earned while in prison, Non-taxable military pay, most rental income, and S-Corp passthrough income Ordinary income is taxed the same as earned income with the exception that social security taxes do not apply. This is the \"\"pure taxable income\"\" referred to in the other linked question. Dividends paid by US Corporations and qualified foreign corporations to stock-holders (that are held for a certain period of time before the dividend is paid) are taxed at the Long-term Capital Gains rate explained below. Ordinary dividends like the interest earned in your bank account are included with ordinary income.  Stocks, Bonds, Real estate, Carried interest -- Held for more than a year Income from assets that increase in value while being held for over a year. Long term capital gains justified by the idea that they encourage people to hold stock and make long term investments rather than buying and then quickly reselling for a short-term profit.  The lower tax rates also reflect the fact that many of these assets are already taxed as they are appreciating in value. Real-estate is usually taxed through local property taxes. Equity in US corporations realized by rising stock prices and dividends that are returned to stock holders reflect earnings from a corporation that are already taxed at the 35% Corporate tax rate. Taxing Capital gains as ordinary income would be a second tax on those same profits. Another problem with Long-term capital gains tax is that a big portion of the gains for assets held for multiple decades are not real gains. Inflation increases the price of assets held for longer periods, but you are still taxed on the full gain even if it would be a loss when inflation is calculated. Capital gains are also taxed differently depending on your income level. If you are in the 10% or 15% brackets then Long-term capital gains are assessed at 0%. If you are in the 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35% brackets, they are assessed at 15%. Only those in the 39.6% bracket pay 20%. Capital assets sold at a profit held for less than a year Income from buying and selling any assets such as real-estate, stock, bonds, etc., that you hold for less than a year before selling. After adding up all gains and losses during the year, the net gain is taxed as ordinary income. Collectibles held for more than a year are not considered capital assets and are still taxed at ordinary income rates.\""

        "question": "Looking for good investment vehicle for seasonal work and savings",
        "answer": "Based on the information in the document, here are some investment vehicle recommendations for someone with seasonal work and savings:\n\n1. Roth IRA: Opening a Roth IRA for long-term retirement savings is a good option, as there is no age limit, and the earlier you start, the more you can benefit from the compound interest. Contributions can be made regularly, such as after each season of work .\n\n2. Investment Allocation: Allocating money for specific purposes rather than saving arbitrarily can lead to better results. You can diversify your savings by putting funds intended for different needs in various types of accounts. For instance, putting savings for a new car in a bank savings account, keeping emergency funds in cash, and investing in stocks or an S&P low-cost index fund for long-term growth like starting a new business .\n\n3. Liquid Funds: Ensuring some funds remain liquid and accessible for immediate use, such as for tax payments or unforeseen expenses, is essential. Using an interest-bearing checking or savings account, possibly with an online bank offering competitive interest rates, can safeguard these funds .\n\n4. Dollar-Cost Averaging: If investing in the stock market, a dollar-cost averaging strategy can mitigate the risk of market fluctuation. Investing a lump sum initially followed by consistent monthly investments, and reinvesting dividends, can help build wealth over time. Using tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or SIPPs is advised to avoid the temptation to withdraw the investments prematurely .\n\n5. Emergency Fund: Given the seasonal nature of your work, building an emergency fund equating to about six months of income can provide financial security. A simple way to accomplish this is to save a substantial portion of your income during your working season specifically for this purpose .\n\nIt's important to consider your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals when selecting the best investment vehicle.

With your one friend having such a low emergency fund, there is very little room for error.

Any other options that may result in a higher yield will either tie up your money for a set length of time, or expose you to risk of losing money.

        "answer": "The \"T + 3 settlement days\" rule refers to the standard set by most securities exchanges that trades complete three days after the bargain has been struck. This means that when you trade securities, the settlement, which involves the transfer of securities from the seller to the buyer and the payment from the buyer to the seller, will officially occur three days after the trade is executed.\n\nThis period is necessary for several reasons. For example, when you sell securities through a broker like Schwab, Schwab needs to receive the funds from the other side of the transaction. If Schwab provided access to funds immediately, it would be akin to offering a loan until the transaction settles after the exchange of funds and securities. It might take two days for the money to be received since the other side has three days for settlement as well. A guaranteed one-day settlement would entail the receipt of funds from the buyer within one day, which Schwab cannot control, given that transactions usually include other parties in addition to the primary ones involved.\n\nAnother point to understand is the complexity involved in the securities industry. A sell order, for example, might be processed on an algorithmic platform, combined with other sell orders, and matched with internal buy orders. The resulting \"fills\" from these transactions may involve multiple trades against different counterparties. Consequently, a three-day period is needed to ensure that all these transactions are accurately processed, settled, and that funds are correctly transferred to the account of the person who executed the trade. This level of complexity requires coordination between banks and other entities all over the world, and settlement teams often work with legacy systems that need to process thousands of transactions for a single name.\n\nIt should be noted that one way to avoid this waiting period is by opening a margin account, which allows you to borrow money to avoid the settlement period or to buy more securities than you can afford. However, using a margin account can expose you to losses potentially larger than your initial investment if the value of the purchased securities declines.\n\nThis information summarizes the key points related to the T + 3 settlement days rule as found in the provided document .",

The problem with this scenario is that the client, if allowed to free ride, can profit from a stock trade without actually using any of his or her own capital. This is illegal. I have not heard of any issues with this type of action being a problem with trading accounts in Australia, nor have I been able to find any such rules on the ASX website or any of by brokers websites.

        "question": "How should I prepare for the next financial crisis?",
        "answer": "To prepare for the next financial crisis, here are some strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Maintain a Solid Asset Mix**: Your investments should reflect your risk tolerance. Long-term investing should not be swayed by short-term predictions of disaster but should remain consistent with your financial goals and risk appetite .\n\n2. **Have Sufficient Cash Reserves**: During times of crisis, liquidity is important. Cash reserves can help you manage your expenses without the need to liquidate investments at a loss. Aim to have a substantial emergency fund to cover unexpected needs .\n\n3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Avoid putting all your investments in a single mutual fund or sector. Having a diversified portfolio across different asset classes can provide a level of protection against market volatility .\n\n4. **Consider Precious Metals**: A small allocation of your portfolio towards gold and precious metals might act as an insurance policy, although it may not be as practical for direct transactions as it once was .\n\n5. **Be Flexible with Housing**: Renting, instead of buying, can offer flexibility in a crisis, allowing you to move or downgrade without the need to sell a house at potentially low prices .\n\n6. **Develop Passive Income Streams**: Creating a side business or income-producing activity can be a buffer in retirement years and can provide a financial safety net in times of crisis .\n\n7. **Maximize Your Retirement Accounts**: Be sure to max out any 401(k) contributions, especially if your company offers matching contributions. However, first ensure you have an emergency fund and are not carrying high-interest debt .\n\n8. **Stay Informed and Educated**: Familiarize yourself with documentaries and materials that discuss the retirement crisis and financial preparedness to understand the broader landscape and to make informed decisions. Examples include PBS FRONTLINE's \"The Retirement Gamble\" or \"Can You Afford To Retire?\" .\n\nRemember that these are general tips, and you should consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice suited to your specific situation.",

            "Your asset mix should reflect your own risk tolerance.  Whatever the ideal answer to your question, it requires you to have good timing, not once, but twice. Let me offer a personal example. In 2007, the S&P hit its short term peak at 1550 or so. As it tanked in the crisis, a coworker shared with me that he went to cash, on the way down, selling out at about 1100. At the bottom, 670 or so, I congratulated his brilliance (sarcasm here) and as it passed 1300 just 2 years later, again mentions how he must be thrilled he doubled his money. He admitted he was still in cash. Done with stocks. So he was worse off than had he held on to his pre-crash assets. For sake of disclosure, my own mix at the time was 100% stock. That's not a recommendation, just a reflection of how my wife and I were invested.  We retired early, and after the 2013 excellent year, moved to a mix closer to 75/25. At any time, a crisis hits, and we have 5-6 years spending money to let the market recover. If a Japanesque long term decline occurs, Social Security kicks in for us in 8 years.  If my intent wasn't 100% clear, I'm suggesting your long term investing should always reflect your own risk tolerance, not some short term gut feel that disaster is around the corner.",

Gold and precious metals have a place in one's portfolio, say 5-10 percent as an insurance policy.

            "A somewhat provocative (but not unserious) proposal: Rent, don't buy a house to live in. In 2007/8, the thing that got many people in deep trouble is their mortgage. It's not a productive investment but a speculative bet on what was in fact a bubble and a class of assets that is notoriously slow to recover after a slump. Before thinking about your savings or buying into silly ideas about gold, you should realise that as a middle class worker, the biggest risk after a crisis is losing your job. Renting your accommodation means being able to downgrade or move very quickly and not being forced to sell a house at the worse possible time. If you really do need to liquidate some of your investments at a bad time, having a more diversified portfolio means that you are not losing everything to meet some short-term obligations. Assuming you're in the US, this means forgoing some nice tax advantages that might be too tempting to resist (I'm not so I am basing this on what I read on this site) but, bubbles aside, there is nothing that makes real estate a particularly good investment as such, especially if you also live in the house you're buying. You might very well come out on top but you expose yourself to several risks and are less prepared to face a crisis."

        "question": "Is there an advantage to a traditional but non-deductable IRA over a taxable account? [duplicate]",
        "answer": "There are several advantages to contributing to a traditional non-deductible IRA over a taxable account. Below are some key points:\n\n1. **Backdoor Roth IRA Conversion**: A common use of non-deductible traditional IRA contributions is as an intermediate step in a \"backdoor Roth IRA contribution\". This involves contributing to a traditional IRA and then immediately converting it into a Roth IRA. If you don't have previous pre-tax money in traditional or other IRAs, the conversion process is tax-free, bypassing income limits that might prevent direct Roth IRA contributions .\n\n2. **Tax on Earnings**: If you hold tax-inefficient assets, like an interest-bearing CD, bond, or dividend-yielding stocks, a taxable account would require you to pay taxes repeatedly on the earnings. With a non-deductible Traditional IRA, despite the contributions being with after-tax money, the earnings grow tax-deferred, and you only pay taxes when you eventually make withdrawals .\n\n3. **Conversion Rules**: If you already have an IRA in place, you must consider pro-rata rules on conversions. For example, if your IRA balance is $40K, of which $10K was non-deductible contributions, a conversion of any part of this IRA to a Roth IRA would be taxed proportionally. Therefore, converting $20K would result in taxes on $15K of that money .\n\n4. **Asset Placement**: A traditional non-deductible IRA could be a good place for income-producing investments or those with nonqualified dividends, such as bonds, REITs, MLPs, and other partnerships. Since these are typically taxed at the income rate and generally generate more income than capital gains, having them in an IRA allows for the deferral of taxes without foregoing the capital gains rate you would get in a taxable account .\n\nIn summary, a traditional non-deductible IRA can offer tax deferral on investment earnings, a strategic way to execute a backdoor Roth IRA conversion, and advantageous ways to invest in less tax-efficient assets. Nevertheless, the suitability of these strategies depends on individual financial situations and tax profiles.",

(This is something you should consider since you are unable to directly contribute to a Roth IRA due to income limits.) Also, I want to note that your comparison is only true assuming you are holding tax-efficient assets, ones where you get taxed once at the end when you take it out. If you are holding tax-inefficient assets, like an interest-bearing CD or bond or a stock that regularly produces dividends, in a taxable account you would be taxed many times on that earnings, and that would be much worse than with the non-deductible Traditional IRA, where you would only be taxed once at the end when you take it out.\"",
            "The simplest answer is that you can convert the IRA to a Roth, and since it was already taxed, pay no tax on conversion.

The longer you wait the more painful it will be because you won't have the benefit of time for your money to grow. You may think you will have more disposable income at some point later when things are paid off, but trust me you wont. When college tuition kicks in for that kid, you are going to LAUGH at those student loan amounts as paltry. The wording of your question was confusing because you say in one place that you have no savings, but in another you claim to be putting away around $5k/year. The important point is how much you have saved at this point and how much you are putting in going forward. Some rules of thumb from Fidelity: (Based on your scenario) Take a look at your retirement account. Are you on track for that? It doesn't sound like it.  Can you get away with your current plan? Sure, lots of people do, but unless you die young, hit the jackpot in the stock market or lottery, you are probably going to have to live WELL below your current standard of living to make that happen.",
            "You are making close to 200 K a year which is great. The aggressive payments on loans takes out around 30K which is good. The fact that you are not able to save is bad. Rather than pushing off your savings to later, scale down the lifestyle and push the upgrade to lifestyle for later",
            "Yes, you should be saving for retirement. There are a million ideas out there on how much is a reasonable amount, but I think most advisor would say at least 6 to 10% of your income, which in your case is around $15,000 per year. You give amounts in dollars. Are you in the U.S.? If so, there are at least two very good reasons to put money into a 401k or IRA rather than ordinary savings or investments: (a) Often your employer will make matching contributions. 50% up to 6% of your salary is pretty common, i.e. if you put in 6% they put in 3%. If either of your employers has such a plan, that's an instant 50% profit on your investment. (b) Any profits on money invested in an IRA or 401k are tax free. (Effectively, the mechanics differ depending on the type of account.) So if you put $100,000 into an IRA today and left it there until you retire 30 years later, it would likely earn something like  $600,000 over that time (assuming 7% per year growth). So you'd pay takes on your initial $100,000 but none on the $600,000. With your income you are likely in a high tax bracket, that would make a huge difference. If you're saying that you just can't find a way to put money away for retirement, may I suggest that you cut back on your spending. I understand that the average American family makes about $45,000 per year and somehow manages to live on that. If you were to put 10% of your income toward retirement, then you would be living on the remaining $171,000, which is still almost 4 times what the average family has. Yeah, I make more than $45,000 a year too and there are times when I think, How could anyone possibly live on that? But then I think about what I spend my money on. Did I really need to buy two new computer printers the last couple of months? I certainly could do my own cleaning rather than hiring a cleaning lady to come in twice a month. Etc. A tough decision to make can be paying off debt versus putting money into an investment account. If the likely return on investment is less than the interest rate on the loan, you should certainly concentrate on paying off the loan. But if the reverse is true, then you need to decide between likely returns and risk.",
            "\"First, I would recommend getting rid of this ridiculous debt, or remember this day and this answer, \"\"you will be living this way for many years to come and maybe worse, no/not enough retirement\"\".  Hold off on any retirement savings right now so that the money can be used to crush this debt. Without knowing all of your specifics (health insurance deductions, etc.) and without any retirement contribution, given $190,000 you should probably be taking home around $12,000 per month total.  Assuming a $2,000 mortgage payment (30 year term), that is $10,000 left per month.  If you were serious about paying this off, you could easily live off of $3,000 per month (probably less) and have $7,000 left to throw at the student loan debt.  This assumes that you haven't financed automobiles, especially expensive ones or have other significant debt payments. That's around 3 years until the entire $300,000 is paid! I have personally used and endorse the snowball method (pay off smallest to largest regardless of interest rate), though I did adjust it slightly to pay off some debts first that had a very high monthly payment so that I would then have this large payment to throw at the next debt. After the debt is gone, you now have the extra $7,000 per month (probably more if you get raises, bonuses etc.) to enjoy and start saving for retirement and kid's college.  You may have 20-25 years to save for retirement; at $4,000 per month that's $1 million in just savings, not including the growth (with moderate growth this could easily double or more).  You'll also have about 14 years to save for college for this one kid; at $1,500 per month that's $250,000 (not including investment growth). This is probably overkill for one kid, so adjust accordingly. Then there's at least $1,500 per month left to pay off the mortgage in less than half the time of the original term! So in this scenario, conservatively you might have: Obviously I don't know your financials or circumstances, so build a good budget and play with the numbers.  If you sacrifice for a short time you'll be way better off, trust me from experience. As a side note:  Assuming the loan debt is 50/50 you and your husband, you made a good investment and he made a poor one.  Unless he is a public defender or charity attorney, why is he making $60,000 when you are both attorneys and both have huge student loan debt?  If it were me, I would consider a job change.  At least until the debt was cleaned up.  If he can make $100,000 to $130,000 or more, then your debt may be gone in under 2 years!  Then he can go back to the charity gig.\"",
            "As a rule, one should have a retirement. HOWEVER, you also have over a half a million dollars of debt.  Paying down debt is another way to prepare for retirement.  I would say throwing your excess money at your debts is a fine strategy right now.  Especially the student loan (the mortgage probably has a lower rate and brings tax savings, so paying it off is less urgent). If I were you I'd probably put SOMETHING into tax deferred retirement accounts because in your tax bracket, the savings from doing so are significant. The max you can put in tax deferred is $5,500 per year (each) in IRA's and up to $17,000 to your 401(k) each.  The tax-saving contribution opportunities will not come up again...you can't make up for it later.

            "The question regarding your snapshot is fine, but the real question is what are you doing to improve your situation?  As John offered, one bit of guidance suggests you have a full year's gross earnings as a saving target. In my opinion, that's on the low side, and 2X should be the goal by 35.  I suggest you look back, and see if you can account for every dollar for the prior 6-12 months. This exercise isn't for the purpose of criticizing your restaurant spending, or cost of clothes, but to just bring it to light. Often, there's some low hanging fruit in this type of budgeting exercise, spending that you didn't realize was so high.  I'd also look carefully at your debt. What rate is the mortgage and the student loans? By understanding the loans' rates, terms, and tax status (e.g. whether any is a deduction) you can best choose the way to pay it off. If the rates are low enough you might consider funding your 401(k) accounts a bit more and slow down the loan payments.  It seems that in your 30's you have a negative net worth, but your true asset is your education and future earning potential.  From a high level view, you make $180K. Taking $50K off the top (which after taxes gives you $30K) to pay your student loan, you are still earning $130K, putting you at or near top 10% of families in this country. This should be enough to afford that mortgage, and still live a nice life.  In the end there are three paths, earn more (why does hubby earn half what you do, in the same field?), spend less, or reallocate current budget by changing how you are handling that debt."

In practice it might be worth it to avoid needing to send forms and checks every quarter. For instance if you had a $1000 estimated tax requirement and the alternative was to get 1% taxable savings account interest for six months, you'd make about $3 from holding it for the year. I would choose to just pay in advance. If you had a very large estimation, or you could pay off a high-rate debt and get a different effective rate of return, the tradeoff may be different.",

Or you sold stock at a profit that would also put you in the Capital Gain area.  You won a large sum in a lottery, the refund could cushion a bit of the tax. In short, if you think you will have a tax liability in the current year then on the tax return you are filing for the year that just past, it may be to your benefit to apply the refund.

If in the year you are currently in- before you file your taxes-- you realize that you will have to pay at the end of the current year, then assigning your refund will pay part or all of the liability.

        "question": "What extra information might be obtained from the next highest bids in an order book?",
        "answer": "From the next highest bids in an order book, additional information can be gleaned that is useful for understanding market sentiment and liquidity, as well as for making informed trading decisions. The next highest bid after the current best bid gives an indication of the depth of the market demand at price levels below the best bid. It can show how much the market price might be depressed if large volumes are sold and the best bids are filled, moving the price down to the next level. For instance, if the best bid price is cleared out by a large sell order, the next best price will become the new current bid, which could be lower.\n\nMoreover, looking at the next highest bids can reveal the price points where there might be large clusters of buy orders, which can act as potential support levels for the stock price. It can also help traders anticipate the possible price moves if they plan to sell a significant number of shares that may exceed the volume of the best bid. This information is crucial for traders who are trying to liquidate large positions without causing significant market impact .\n\nIt should be noted that in highly liquid stocks, the order book receives many amendments per second, so the impact of a single trade might be minimal compared to the overall market activity. However, in less liquid stocks, understanding the levels of the next highest bids also becomes particularly important as the market impact of trades can be more significant, and market makers often play a more prominent role in providing liquidity with their buy and sell orders .",

            "The Level 2 data is simply showing the depth of the market. If I am trading shares with my broker I have the option of viewing only the top 10 bid/ask prices in the depth or all of the data (which sometimes can be a very long list). With another broker I get the top ten bid and ask prices and how many orders are available for each price level, or I have the option of listing each order separately for each price level (in order of when the order was placed). I get the same kind of data if trading options. I do not know about futures because I don't trade them. Simply this data may be important to a trader because it may give an indication of whether there are more buyers or sellers in the market, which in turn may (but not always) give an indication of which way the market may be moving. As an example the price depth below shows WBC before market open with sellers outweighing the buyers in both numbers and volume.  This gives an indication that prices may drop when the market opens. Of course there could be some good news coming out prior to market open or just after, causing a flood of buyers into the market and sellers to cancel their orders. This would change everything around with more buyers than sellers and indicate that prices may now be going up. The market depth is an important aspect to look at before putting an order in, as it can give an indication of which way the market is moving, especially in a very liquid security or market.",

And of course skilled market participants know that there's people out there looking to glean information from the order book and will act to confuse the picture.

For example, with an online brokerage like Questrade.com, the cost for trading can be as low as a penny per share with a minimum cost of $4.95 and up to a maximum of $9.95 per trade. The details depend on the number of shares traded; if you buy 100 shares, you'll pay the minimum of $4.95, but if you buy 10,000 shares, you only pay $9.95 . This example demonstrates that the cost structure may be tiered or based on a per-share fee with minimums and caps. It is important to consider such fees when trading, as they can add up over time and affect investment returns.",

            "There is no one answer to this question, but there are some generalities. Most exchanges make a distinction between the passive and the aggressive sides of a trade.  The passive participant is the order that was resting on the market at the time of the trade.  It is an order that based on its price was not executable at the time, and therefore goes into the order book.  For example, I'm willing to sell 100 shares of a stock at $9.98 but nobody wants to buy that right now, so it remains as an open order on the exchange. Then somebody comes along and is willing to meet my price (I am glossing over lots of details here).  So they aggressively take out my order by either posting a market-buy, or specifically that they want to buy 100 shares at either $9.98, or at some higher price. Most exchanges will actually give me, as the passive (i.e. liquidity making) investor a small rebate, while the other person is charged a few fractions of a cent.  Google found NYSEArca details, and most other exchanges make their fees public as well.  As of this writing the generic price charged/credited: But they provide volume discounts, and many of the larger deals do fall into another tier of volume, which provides a different price structure."

        "question": "Investment strategy for 401k when rolling over soon",
        "answer": "When rolling over your 401(k), it's essential to be aware of the fees associated with your current plan and compare them to any potential new plan. For instance, if your current 401(k) carries high fees, you may benefit from rolling it over into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), where you might have access to a broader range of investment options with lower fees . It\u2019s also wise to take advantage of any employer matching contributions to your 401(k) before considering a rollover, as this is essentially free money. After matching, if you find that the investment options in your current 401(k) are limited or have high fees, rolling over into an IRA might be more beneficial .\n\nThe strategy also depends on whether you expect to be in a higher tax bracket now or during retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it might be advantageous to invest through a Roth account. With a Roth, you pay taxes on contributions now but withdraw the money tax-free in retirement. If you're currently in a higher tax bracket and believe you'll be in a lower one during retirement, the traditional 401(k) or IRA's tax-deferral benefits could be more beneficial .\n\nIt's important to remember that tax laws and financial situations are complex and often require personalized advice. If you're unsure about which strategy to adopt, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice according to your specific financial situation and goals.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "You will be rolling over the proceeds, since you can only deposit cash into an IRA. However, this should probably not affect your considerations much since the pre-rollover sale is non-taxable within the 401k and the period of roll-over itself (when the cash is uninvested) is relatively short. So, whatever investments you choose in your 401k, you'll just sell them and then buy them (or similar investments) back after the rollover to the IRA. If you're worrying about a flash crash right on the day when you want to cash out - that can definitely happen, but it is not really something you can prepare for. You can consider moving to money market several weeks before the potential date of your withdrawal, if you think it will make you feel safer, otherwise I don't think it really matters.",
            "The time horizon for your 401K/IRA is essentially the same, and it doesn't stop at the day you retire. On the day you do the rollover you will be transferring your funds into similar investments. S&P500 index to S&P 500 index; 20xx retirement date to 20xx retirement date; small cap to small cap... If your vested portion is worth X $'s when the funds are sold, that is the amount that will be transferred to the IRA  custodian or the custodian for the new employer. Use the transfer to make any rebalancing adjustments that you want to make. But with as much as a year before you leave the company if you need to rebalance now, then do that irrespective of your leaving. Cash is what is transferred, not the individual stock or mutual fund shares. Only move your funds into a money market account with your current 401K if that makes the most sense for your retirement plan. Also keep in mind unless the amount in the 401K is very small you don't have to do this on your last day of work. Even if you are putting the funds in a IRA wait until you have started with the new company and so can define all your buckets based on the options in the new company."

        "question": "Does a market maker sell (buy) at a bid or ask price?",
        "answer": "A market maker sells at the ask price and buys at the bid price. This is opposite of what an everyday investor does\u2014a regular investor buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price. Essentially, the market maker makes a profit from the spread, which is the difference between the bid and ask prices. For example, if a customer buy order for shares is to be filled and the market maker has quoted \"bid 15, ask 15.25,\" the market maker would sell the shares at the ask price of $15.25 per share if the order is placed .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"EVERYONE buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price (no matter who you are). There are a few important things you need to understand. Example: EVE bid: 16.00 EVE ask: 16.25 So if your selling EVE at \"\"market price\"\" you are entering an ask equal to the highest bid ($16.00). If you buy EVE at \"\"market price\"\" you are entering a bid equal to the lowest ask price ($16.25). Its key to understand this rule: \"\"An order executes ONLY when both bid and ask meet. (bid = ask).\"\" So a market maker puts in a bid when he wants to buy but the trade only executes when an ASK price meets his BID price. When you see a quote for a stock it is the price of the last trade. So it is possible to have a quote higher or lower then both the bid and the ask.\"",
            "\"The answer posted by Kirill Fuchs is incorrect according to my series 65 text book and practice question answers. The everyday investor buys at the ask and sells at the bid but the market maker does the opposite. THE MARKET MAKER \"\"BUYS AT THE BID AND SELLS AT THE ASK\"\", he makes a profit form the spread. I have posted a quiz question and the answer created by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). To fill a customer buy order for 800 WXYZ shares, your firm requests a quote from a market maker. The response is \"\"bid 15, ask 15.25.\"\" If the order is placed, the market maker must sell: A)   800 shares at $15.25 per share. B)   800 shares at $15 per share. C)   100 shares at $15.25 per share. D)   800 shares at no more than $15 per share. Your answer, sell 800 shares at $15.25 per share., was correct!. A market maker is responsible for honoring a firm quote. If no size is requested by the inquiring trader, a quote is firm for 100 shares. In this example, the trader requested an 800-share quote, so the market maker is responsible for selling 8 round lots of 100 shares at the ask price of $15.25 per share.\"",
            "I think your confusion has arisen because in every transaction there is a buyer and a seller, so the market maker buys you're selling, and when you're buying the market maker is selling. Meaning they do in fact buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price (as the quote said).",
            "The everyday investor buys at the ask and sells at the bid but the market maker does the opposite This is misleading; it has nothing to do with being either an investor or a market maker. It is dependent on the type of order that is submitted. When a market trades at the ask, this means that a buy market order has interacted with a sell limit order at the limit price. When a market trades at the bid, this means that a sell market order has interacted with a buy limit order at the limit price. An ordinary investor can do exactly the same as a market maker and submit limit orders. Furthermore, they can sit on both sides of the bid and ask exactly as a market maker does. In the days before high frequency trading this was quite common (an example being Daytek, whose traders were notorious for stepping in front of the designated market maker's bid/ask on the Island ECN). An order executes ONLY when both bid and ask meet. (bid = ask) This is completely incorrect. A transaction occurs when an active (marketable) order is matched with a passive (limit book) order. If the passive order is a sell limit then the trade has occurred at the ask, and if it is a buy limit the trade has occurred at the bid. The active orders are not bids and asks. The only exception to this would be if the bid and ask have become crossed. When a seller steps in, he does so with an ask that's lower than the stock's current ask Almost correct; he does so with an order that's lower than the stock's current ask. If it's a marketable order it will fill the front queued best bid, and if it's a limit order his becomes the new ask price. A trade does not need to occur at this price for it to become the ask. This is wrong, market makers are the opposite party to you so the prices are the other way around for them. This is wrong. There is no distinction between the market maker and yourself or any other member of the public (beside the fact that designated market makers on some exchanges are obliged to post both a bid and ask at all times). You can open an account with any broker and do exactly the same as a market maker does (although with nothing like the speed that a high frequency market-making firm can, hence likely making you uncompetitive in this arena). The prices a market maker sees and the types of orders that they are able to use to realize them are exactly the same as for any other trader.",
            "Market Makers are essentially just there to process the buys and sells of traders, so just like you and I buy and sell at the ask and bid prices they do to. They are just completing the process of making our orders a reality. Market makers are just representative of brokers, meaning that when you place your order at ask or bid, you are placing that particular brokers order at ask or bid. People often say that certain brokers have too many shares and claim that they are games when really that just means that there happen to be a lot of people using a particular broker all at once, or more troubling, perhaps even company execs using a broker, to sell a large amount of shares."

        "answer": "Rebalancing a retirement portfolio entails periodically adjusting the asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your investment goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. As you approach retirement, your ability to tolerate risk generally decreases, and rebalancing helps to mitigate the risk of market volatility by diversifying your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities.\n\nThe benefits of rebalancing a retirement portfolio include:\n\n1. **Risk Reduction**: Rebalancing aims to maintain an asset allocation that fits your risk profile. By spreading investments across multiple categories, you manage and potentially lower overall investment risk.\n\n2. **Sell High and Buy Low**: Through rebalancing, you can capitalize on market fluctuations by selling assets that have increased in value and purchasing those that are currently undervalued. This practice aligns with the fundamental investment strategy of selling high and buying low, which can enhance your portfolio returns over time.\n\n3. **Risk Management**: Without regular rebalancing, your portfolio may become too heavily weighted in a single asset class due to market movements, which could expose you to higher risk if that asset category underperforms. By rebalancing, you ensure your investments are not overly concentrated in one area, which helps in managing risk effectively.\n\n4. **Consistency with Investment Goals**: Rebalancing keeps your portfolio aligned with your long-term investment objectives and financial goals. For instance, as you get closer to retirement, you might prefer a less volatile portfolio, and rebalancing allows you to shift towards more conservative investments progressively.\n\n5. **Discipline**: Regular rebalancing instills a disciplined approach to investing. It encourages investors to follow a systematic process rather than reacting to short-term market movements.\n\nIt is generally advised to rebalance a portfolio at regular intervals, such as every 12 to 18 months, which suits a hands-off, long-term investment strategy. Rebalancing can be done by either selling off outperforming assets or simply by adjusting future buying to maintain the desired asset allocation without necessarily selling current holdings .",

            "\"Rebalancing a portfolio helps you reduce risk, sell high, and buy low. I'll use international stocks and large cap US stocks.  They both have ups and downs, and they don't always track with each other (international might be up while large cap US stocks are down and vice-versa) If you started with 50% international and 50% large cap stocks and 1 year later you have 75% international and 25% large cap stocks that means that international stocks are doing (relatively) well to large cap stocks.    Comparing only those two categories, large cap stocks are \"\"on sale\"\" relative to international stocks.   Now move so you have 50% in each category and you've realized some of the gains from your international investment (sell high) and added to your large cap stocks (buy low). The reason to rebalance is to lower risk.   You are spreading your investments across multiple categories to manage risk.   If you don't rebalance, you could end up with 95% in one category and 5% in another which means 95% of your portfolio is tied to the performance of a single asset category. I try to rebalance every 12 months and usually get it done by every 18 months.  I like being a hands-off long term investor and this has proven often enough to beat the S&P500.\"",
            "Rebalancing your portfolio doesn't have to include selling.  You could simply adjust your buying to keep your portfolio in balance.  If you portfolio has shifted from 50% stocks and 50% bonds to 75% stocks and 25% bonds, you can just only use new savings to buy bonds, until you are back at 50-50. Remember to take into account taxes if you are thinking of selling to rebalance in taxable accounts. The goal of rebalancing is to keep your exposures the way that you want them.  Assuming that you had a good reason to have a portfolio of 50% stocks and 50% bonds, you probably want to keep your portfolio similar in the future.  If you end up with a portfolio of 75% stocks and 25% bonds due to stock market fluctuations, the exposure and the risk / return profile of your portfolio will have changed, and it's probably not something that you want. You don't want to rebalance just for the sake of rebalancing either.  There can be costs to rebalancing (taxes, transaction fees, etc...) and these aren't always worth the effort.  That's why you don't need to rebalance every month or if your portfolio has shifted from 50/50 to 51/49. I take a look at my portfolio once a year, and adjust my automated investments so that by the end of the next year I'm back to the ratio I want."

        "question": "How to sell a stock in a crashing market?",
        "answer": "To sell a stock in a crashing market, there are a few key strategies and points to consider:\n\n1. **Market Orders**: Placing a market order means you are willing to sell the stock at any price. In a crashing market, a market maker may fulfill your order but cannot guarantee a price, so be cautious as your sell price might be significantly lower due to rapid price declines .\n\n2. **Limit Orders**: If you're not in a rush and are willing to wait for a more favorable price, placing a limit order could be a better option. This allows you to set a minimum price for the sale and wait for a market participant to meet your offer .\n\n3. **Short Selling**: This is another strategy where you borrow shares and sell them with the intent to repurchase them later at a lower price, hence profiting from the stock's decline. However, short selling requires a margin account and could result in significant losses if the market starts to rebound .\n\n4. **Putting Options**: Buying a put option gives you the right to sell the stock at a predetermined price within a certain time frame. If the stock's price crashes below the strike price of the put option, you can sell the stock at the strike price, thereby limiting your losses. However, options can be complex and often expire worthless, so there's the risk of losing the money spent on them .\n\n5. **Synthetic Short Positions**: These are created by simultaneously buying a put option and selling short a call option; this combination mimics the effect of short selling a stock .\n\n6. **Liquidity and Transaction Size**: Selling during a market crash can be challenging due to liquidity issues. If you are selling a large amount of stock, it may be difficult to find buyers willing to take on a large position at once, which could force you to sell at lower prices .\n\nRemember that in a crashing market, panic selling can exacerbate the situation. So it's essential to have a clear strategy and not to act hastily. Be aware of the order type you choose, as it will affect the execution and price you receive for your stock. Also, consider the tax implications and transaction costs associated when deciding if and when to sell.",

            "\"Assuming you are referring to macro corrections and crashes (as opposed to technical crashes like the \"\"flash crash\"\") -- It is certainly possible to sell stocks during a market drop -- by definition, the market is dropping not only because there are a larger number of sellers, but more importantly because there are a large number of transactions that are driving prices down. In fact, volumes are strongly correlated with volatility, so volumes are actually higher when the market is going down dramatically -- you can verify this on Yahoo or Google Finance (pick a liquid stock like SPY and look at 2008 vs recent years). That doesn't say anything about the kind of selling that occurs though. With respect to your question \"\"Whats the best strategy for selling stocks during a drop?\"\", it really depends on your objective. You can generally always sell at some price. That price will be worse during market crashes. Beyond the obvious fact that prices are declining, spreads in the market will be wider due to heightened volatility. Many people are forced to sell during crashes due to external and / or psychological pressures -- and sometimes selling is the right thing to do -- but the best strategy for long-term investors is often to just hold on.\"",
            "It is typically possible to sell during a crash, because there are enough people that understand the mechanics behind a crash. Generally, you need to understand that you don't lose money from the crash, but from selling. Every single crash in history more than recovered, and by staying invested, you wouldn't have lost anything (this assumes you have enough time to sit it out; it could take several years to recover). On the other side of those deals are people that understand that, and make money by buying during a crash. They simply sit the crash out, and some time later they made a killing from what you panic-sold, when it recovers its value.",
            "\"Your question contains a faulty assumption: During crashes and corrections the amount of sellers is of course higher than the amount of buyers, making it difficult to sell stocks. This simply isn't true.  Every trade has two sides; thus, by definition, for every seller there is buyer and vice versa.  Even if we broaden the definition of \"\"buyers\"\" and \"\"sellers\"\" to mean \"\"people willing to buy (or sell) at some price\"\", the assumption still isn't true.  When a stock is falling it is generally not because potential buyers are exiting the market; it is because they are revising the prices they are willing to buy at downward.   For example, say there are a bunch of orders to buy Frobnitz Consolidated (DUMB) at $5. Suppose DUMB announces a downward revision to its earnings guidance. Those people might not be willing to buy at $50 anymore, so they'll probably cancel their $50 buy orders.  However, just because DUMB isn't worth as much as they thought it was, that doesn't mean it's completely worthless.  So, those prospective buyers will likely enter new orders at some lower value, say, $45.  With that, the value of DUMB has just dropped by $5, a 10% correction.  However, there are still plenty of buyers, and you can still sell your DUMB holdings, if you're willing to take $45 for them. In other words, the value of a security is not determined by the relative numbers of buyers and sellers.  It is determined by the prices those buyers and sellers are willing to pay to buy or accept to sell.  Except for cases of massive IT disruptions, such as we saw in the \"\"flash crash\"\", there is always somebody willing to buy or sell at some price.\"",
            "What is essential is that company you are selling is transparent enough. Because it will provide additional liquidity to market. When I decide to sell, I drop all volume once at a time. Liquidation price will be somewhat worse then usual. But being out of position will save you nerves for future thinking where to step in again. Cold head is best you can afford in such scenario. In very large crashes, there could be large liquidity holes. But if you are on upper side of sigmoid, you will be profiting from selling before that holes appear. Problem is, nobody could predict if market is on upper-fall, mid-fall or down-fall at any time."

        "question": "Probablity of touching In the money vs expiring in the money for an american option",
        "answer": "The probability of an American option being exercised and paying out can be considered in the context of two main factors: the odds that the strike price is in the money at expiry, and the odds that the strike price becomes in the money prior to expiry, coupled with the likelihood of the counterparty exercising early. Unlike European options, which can only be exercised at expiry, American options carry the additional complexity of potential early exercise, making the dynamics of in the money vs. expiring in the money different.\n\nFor an American option, the probability of paying out is not just the odds of expiring in the money but also includes the chance that the option gets into the money prior to expiry and the holder decides to exercise it early. Important considerations for whether the holder might exercise early include the strategy of the holder, whether it is a long strategy or a straddle or a quick turnaround, the amount of time the option is in the money early compared to its expiration, and the anticipated future movement of the underlying asset. Most holders, however, would prefer to wait until closer to expiry to benefit from the time value of the option before deciding on early exercise .\n\nIn summary, while the probability of expiring in the money is a straightforward assessment at the expiry date, the probability of touching in the money for an American option requires a more nuanced evaluation. It must account for the dynamics of early exercise, option holder strategies, and market movements throughout the option's life until its expiry.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Conceptually, yes, you need to worry about it.  As a practical matter, it's less likely to be exercised until expiry or shortly prior. The way to think about paying a European option is: [Odds of paying out] = [odds that strike is in the money at expiry] Whereas the American option can be thought of as: [Odds of paying out] = [odds that strike price is in the money at expiry] + ( [odds that strike price is in the money prior to expiry] * [odds that other party will exercise early] ). This is just a heuristic, not a formal financial tool.  But the point is that you need to consider the odds that it will go into the money early, for how long (maybe over multiple periods), and how likely the counterparty is to exercise early. Important considerations for whether they will exercise early are the strategy of the other side (long, straddle, quick turnaround), the length of time the option is in the money early, and the anticipated future movement. A quick buck strategy might exercise immediately before the stock turns around.  But that could leave further gains on the table, so it's usually best to wait unless the expectation is that the stock will quickly reverse its movement.  This sort of counter-market strategy is generally unlikely from someone who bought the option at a certain strike, and is equivalent to betting against their original purchase of the option.  So most of these people will wait because they expect the possibility of a bigger payoff. A long strategy is usually in no hurry to exercise, and in fact they would prefer to wait until the end to hold the time value of the option (the choice to get out of the option, if it goes back to being unprofitable).  So it usually makes little sense for these people to exercise early.  The same goes for a straddle, if someone is buying an option for insurance or to economically exit a position. So you're really just concerned that people will exercise early and forgo the time value of the American option.  That may include people who really want to close a position, take their money, and move on.  In some cases, it may include people who have become overextended or need liquidity, so they close positions.  But for the most part, it's less likely to happen until the expiration approaches because it leaves potential value on the table.  The time value of an option dwindles at the end because the implicit option becomes less likely, especially if the option is fairly deep in the money (the implicit option is then fairly deep out of the money). So early exercise becomes more meaningful concern as the expiration approaches.  Otherwise, it's usually less worrisome but more than a nonzero proposition."

        "answer": "To translate a per year salary into a part-time, per hour wage, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Annual Salary**: Know the full-time annual salary that you want to convert.\n\n2. **Assume Full-Time Hours**: Define what \"full-time\" means in terms of hours per week. A common full-time schedule is 40 hours per week.\n\n3. **Calculate Full-Time Weekly Wage**:\n   \nTo find the weekly wage for the full-time job, divide the annual salary by the number of weeks worked in a year. Most calculations assume 52 weeks in a year:\n\n   \\( \\text{Full-Time Weekly Wage} = \\text{Annual Salary} \\div 52 \\)\n\n4. **Determine Actual Part-Time Hours**: Decide how many hours per week the part-time job will be.\n\n5. **Calculate the Hourly Rate**:\n   \nDivide the Full-Time Weekly Wage by the number of full-time hours per week to get the full-time hourly rate. Then you can use this rate for the part-time calculation:\n\n   \\( \\text{Hourly Rate} = \\text{Full-Time Weekly Wage} \\div \\text{Full-Time Hours Per Week} \\)\n\n6. **Adjust for Part-Time if Necessary**:\n\nNo further adjustments would be needed if the part-time job involves the same number of hours as defined for full-time. Otherwise, the hourly rate would remain the same irrespective of the number of hours worked part-time since the hourly rate is a standard measure.\n\nHere's an example calculation:\n- Annual Salary: $50,000\n- Full-Time Hours per Week: 40\n- Part-Time Hours per Week: 20\n- Number of Weeks in a Year: 52\n\nFirstly, calculate the full-time weekly wage:\n\\( \\text{Full-Time Weekly Wage} = \\$50,000 \\div 52 \u2248 \\$961.54 \\)\n\nSecondly, calculate the hourly rate for full-time:\n\\( \\text{Hourly Rate} = \\$961.54 \\div 40 \u2248 \\$24.04 \\)\n\nThis hourly rate then applies to the part-time job as well. If you work 20 hours a week part-time, your weekly wage would be:\n\\( \\text{Part-Time Weekly Wage} = 20 \\times \\$24.04 = \\$480.77 \\)\n\nJust remember that this is a simplified scenario and does not take into account potential differences in benefits or differential pay rates that an employer might offer for part-time positions.

If we assume the same for you, then add 3% 401k matching that we'll assume you're taking advantage of ($1650), the equation becomes: Other Considerations Keep in mind that there are other considerations that could offset these calculations.  Variable hours are a big risk, as is your status as a 'temporary' employee.

In column C, using a formula that checks if it's the current bottom entry is suggested:\n`=IF(ISBLANK(A7),-C6, C6)`\nThis checks if the next row has no date entered, indicating that it's the latest value, and if so, makes it negative.\n\n3. To work around XIRR not supporting arrays, you can insert a column (say, as column D) and label it \"ratio\". This will be used to calculate your return in another column (column E).\n\n4. Use the following equation for your initial \"ratio\" cell (D3 in this example):\n`=1+(C3-B3-C2)/C2`\nDrag this formula down the column to fill subsequent cells.\n\n5.

Now, to digress a bit, there are several ways to measure returns. I feel XIRR is good for individual positions, like holding a stock, maybe buying more via DRIP, etc. For the whole portfolio it stinks. XIRR is greatly affected by timing of cash flows. Steady deposits and no withdrawals dramatically skew the return lower. And the opposite is true for steady withdrawals. I prefer to use TWRR (aka TWIRR). Time Weighted Rate of Return. The word 'time' is confusing, because it's the opposite. TWRR is agnostic to timing of cashflows. I have a sample Excel spreadsheet that you're welcome to steal from: http://moosiefinance.com/static/models/spreadsheets.html (it's the top entry in the list). Some people prefer XIRR. TWRR allows an apples-to-apples comparison with indexes and funds. Imagine twin brothers. They both invest in the exact same ideas, but the amount of cash deployed into these ideas is different, solely because one brother gets his salary bonus annually, in January, and the other brother gets no bonus, but has a higher bi-weekly salary to compensate. With TWRR, their percent returns will be identical. With XIRR they will be very different. TWRR separates out investing acumen from the happenstance timing of when you get your money to deposit, and when you retire, when you choose to take withdrawals. Something to think about, if you like. You might find this website interesting, too: http://www.dailyvest.com/",

So in 2008 Typical leverage ratios were Investment Banks 30:1 means that for every 1 Unit of Banks money [shareholders capital/ long term debts] there was 30 Units of borrowed money [from deposits/for other institutions/etc]. This is a very unstable situation as typically say you lent out 31 to someone else, half way through repayments, the depositors and other lends are asking you 30 back. You are sunk. Now lets say if you lent 31 to some one, but 30 was your moeny and 1 was from deposits/etc. Then you can anytime more easily pay back the 1 to the depositor. In day trading, usually one squares away the position the same day or within a short period. Hence say you want to buy something worth 1000 in the morning and are selling it say the same day. You are expecting the price to by 1005 and a gain 5. Now when you buy via your broker/trader, you may not be required to pay 1000. Normally one just needs to pay a margin money, typically 10% [varies from market to market, country to country]. So in the first case if you put 1000 and get by 5, you made a profit of 0.5%. However if you were to pay only 10 as margin money [rest 990 is assumed loan from your broker]. You sell at 1005, the broker deducts his 990, and you get 15. So technically on 10 you have made 5 more, ie 50% returns. So this is leveraging of 10:1. If say your broker allowed only 5% margin money, then you just need to pay 5 for the 1000 trade, get back 5. You have made a 100% profit, but the leveraging is 20:1.  Now lets say at this high leveraging when you are selling you get only 990. So you still owe the broker 5, if you can't pay-up and if lot of other such people can't pay-up, then the broker will also go bankrupt and there is a huge risk.  Hence although leveraging helps in quite a few cases, there is always an associated risk when things go wrong badly.",
            "This would clear out a lot more. 1) Leverage is the act of taking on debt in lieu of the equity you hold. Not always related to firms, it applies to personal situations too. When you take a loan, you get a certain %age of the loan, the bank establishes your equity by looking at your past financial records and then decides the amount it is going to lend, deciding on the safest leverage. In the current action leverage is the whole act of borrowing yen and profiting from it. The leverage factor mentions the amount of leverage happening. 10000 yen being borrowed with an equity of 1000 yen. 2) Commercial banks: 10 to 1 -> They don't deal in complicated investments, derivatives except for hedging, and are under stricter controls of the government. They have to have certain amount of liquidity and can loan out the rest for business. Investment banks: 30 to 1 -> Their main idea is making money and trade heavily. Their deposits are limited by the amount clients have deposited. And as their main motive is to get maximum returns from the available amount, they trade heavily. Derivatives, one of the instruments, are structured on underlyings and sometimes in multiple layers which build up quite a bit of leverage. And all of the trades happen on margins. You don't invest $10k to buy $10k of a traded stock. You put in, maybe $500 to take up the position and borrow the rest of the amount per se. It improves liquidity in the markets and increases efficiency. Else you could do only with what you have. So these margins add up to the leverage the bank is taking on.",
            "Your original example is a little confusing because just shorting for 1k and buying for 1k is 100% leveraged or an infinitive leverage ratio. (and not allowed) Brokerage houses would require you to invest some capital in the trade.  One example might be requiring you to hold $100 in the brokerage.  This is where the 10:1 ratio comes from. (1000/10) Thus a return of 4.5% on the 1000k bond and no movement on the short position would net you $45 and voila a 45% return on your $100 investment. A 40 to 1 leverage ratio would mean that you would only have to invest $25 to make this trade.  Something that no individual investor are allowed to do, but for some reason some financial firms have been able to."

        "question": "Is is possible to dispute IRS underpayment penalties?",
        "answer": "Yes, it is possible to dispute IRS underpayment penalties. According to the document provided, if you file the long-form Form 2210, you might be able to reduce or possibly eliminate the underpayment penalty. This can be the case if some of your income was received late in the year or if your itemized deductions were front-loaded earlier in the year. However, it takes a considerable effort to gather all the necessary information for this, and mistakes can be made while filling out the form. Tax programs labeled as \"deluxe\" or \"premier\" might assist in this process considering the basic versions might not include Form 2210 or have only a short version of it. The document advises that the long form 2210 must be filed with the tax return and cannot be filed as part of an amended return, meaning this advice would apply to future years only. \n\nHowever, if you don't file the long form 2210 with your tax return, you might still be able to make an appeal to the IRS to either reduce the penalty or determine that you don't owe a penalty, particularly if you can show that your only mistake was not filing the long form. It is recommended to pay the underpayment penalty as soon as possible due to accruing interest, and in case the IRS agrees to your request, they will refund the overpayment.\n\nThe document also clarifies that an honest mistake can still result in a penalty and stresses that while you can appeal on various grounds, success is not guaranteed. The underpayment \"penalty\" is described as simply interest on the late payments and is not based on the willfulness of the underpayment .",

Problem is, this wasn't unusual, it was an oversight. You have no legitimate grounds to dispute. Sorry.\"",
            "\"If you file the long-form Form 2210 in which you have to figure out  exactly how much you should have had withheld (or paid via quarterly payments of estimated tax), you might be able to reduce the underpayment penalty somewhat, or possibly eliminate it entirely.  This often happens because some of your income comes late in the year (e.g. dividend and capital gain distributions from stock mutual funds) and possibly because some of your itemized deductions come early (e.g. real estate tax bills due April 1, charitable deductions early in the year because of New Year resolutions to be more philanthropic) etc.  It takes a fair amount of effort to gather up the information you need for this (money management programs help), and it is easy to make mistakes while filling out the form. I strongly recommend use of a \"\"deluxe\"\" or \"\"premier\"\" version of a tax program - basic versions might not include Form 2210 or have only the short version of it. I also seem to remember something to the effect that the long form 2210 must be filed with the tax return and cannot be filed as part of an amended return, and if so, the above advice would be applicable to future years only. But you might be able to fill out the form and appeal to the IRS that you owe a reduced  penalty, or don't owe a penalty at all, and that your only mistake was not filing the long form 2210 with your tax return and so please can you be forgiven this once? In any case, I strongly recommend paying the underpayment   penalty ASAP because it is increasing day by day due to   interest being charged.  If the IRS agrees to your eloquent   appeal, they will refund the overpayment.\"",
            "didn't pay the extra underpayment penalty on the grounds that it was   an honest mistake. You seem to think a penalty applies only when the IRS thinks you were trying to cheat the system.  That's not the case. A mistake (honest or otherwise) still can imply a penalty. While you can appeal just about anything, on any grounds you like, it's unlikely you will prevail.",

        "question": "How much should I be contributing to my 401k given my employer's contribution?",
        "answer": "How much you should be contributing to your 401k depends on several factors including your employer's contribution match, your own financial goals, and the investment options available to you. The document suggests that:\n\n- You should first contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For example, if your employer matches your contributions dollar for dollar up to a certain percent of your pay, you should aim to contribute at least up to that limit to maximize your benefit .\n- After gaining the full employer match, it might be wise to invest in an IRA to take advantage of more and possibly better investment options, and then go back to contributing to your 401k once you have maxed out your IRA contributions for the year .\n- If you are able to afford it, contributing as much as you can to your 401k early on can be beneficial due to the compounding effect over time. The hit to your take-home pay may be less than you expect because contributions are pre-tax .\n\nIt's a good rule of thumb to strive to save at least 10% of your income for retirement; however, if your employer provides a matching contribution, it may be advantageous to contribute at least enough to get the full match, and then consider additional contributions based on your financial situation and retirement goals . Always pay attention to the investment options within your 401k and their associated fees, as high fees can negate the tax benefits you gain from contributing to a 401k .\n\nPlease note that these suggestions are based on the general advice found in the document and may not take into account your specific financial situation. It is often beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to create a personalized retirement savings plan.",

I do not know of a way to get a better guaranteed ROI. Next, when investing you need to determine what kind of investor you are. I would suggest you make yourself more literate in investments, as I suggest to anyone, but there are basic things you want to look for. If your primary worry is loss of your prinicipal, go for Conservative investments. This means that you are willing to accept a reduced expected ROI in exchange for lower volatility(risk of loss of principal). This does not mean you have a 100% safe investment as the last market issues have shown, but in general you are better protected. The fidelity investments should give you some information as to volatility or if they deem the investments conservative. Conservative investments are normally made up of trading bonds, which have the lowest ROI in general but are the most secure. You can also invest in blue chip companies, although stock is inherently riskier. It is pointed out in comments that stocks always outperform bonds in the long term, and this has been true over the last 100 years. I am just suggesting ways you can protect yourself against market downturns. When the market is doing very well bonds will not give you the return your friends are seeing. I am just trying to give you a basic idea of what to look for when you pick your investments, nothing can replace a solid investment adviser and taking the time to educate yourself.",
            "You can only contribute up to 5% of your salary? Odd. Usually 401(k) contributions are limited to some dollar amount in the vicinity of $15,000 or so a year. Normal retirement guidelines suggest that putting away 10-15% of your salary is enough that you probably won't need to worry much when you retire. 5% isn't likely to be enough, employer match or no. I'd try to contribute 10-15% of my salary. I think you're reading the rules wrong. I'm almost certain. It's definitely worth checking. If you're not, you should seriously consider supplementing this saving with a Roth IRA or just an after-tax account.  So. If you're with Fidelity and don't know what to do, look for a target date fund with a date near your retirement (e.g. Target Retirement 2040) and put 100% in there until you have a better idea of what going on. All Fidelity funds have pretty miserable expense ratios, even their token S&P500 index fund from another provider, so you might as let them do some leg work and pick your asset allocation for you. Alternatively, look for the Fidelity retirement planner tools on their website to suggest an asset allocation. As a (very rough) rule of thumb, as you're saving for retirement you'll want to have N% of your portfolio in bonds and the rest in stocks, where N is your age in years. Your stocks should probably be split about 70% US and 30% rest-of-world, give or take, and your US stocks should be split about 64% large-cap, 28% mid-cap and 8% small-cap (that's basically how the US stock market is split).",

If you trust it to other people, don't be surprised when they make \"\"mistakes\"\".  Remember, they get paid regardless of whether you make money.  Consider how much any degree of risk will affect you.  When starting out, your contributions make up most of the growth of your accounts; now is the time when you can most afford to take higher risk for higher payouts (still limiting your risk as much as possible, of course).  A 10% loss on a portfolio of $50k can be replaced with a good year's contributions.  Once your portfolio has grown to a much larger sum, it will be time to dial back the risk and focus on preserving your capital.   When choosing investments, always treat your porfolio as a whole - including non-retirement assets (other investment accounts, savings, even your house).  Don't put too many eggs from every account into the same basket, or you'll find that 30% of your porfolio is a single investment.  Also consider that some investments have different tax consequences, and you can leverage the properties of each account to offset that.\"",

        "answer": "The values of 12, 26, and 9 are the standard settings commonly used with the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. In the MACD calculation:\n\n- The number 12 represents the previous 12 days' Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is considered a short-term moving average.\n- The number 26 represents the previous 26 days' EMA, which is taken as the longer-term moving average when compared with the 12-day EMA.\n- The number 9 represents the signal line, which is the EMA of the MACD itself, calculated over the previous 9 days.\n\nThese standard values are selected as they are thought to offer a good balance between sensitivity to price movements (with the shorter EMA) and a smoother, more reliable signal (with the longer EMA and the signal line). The 12 and 26-day periods are meant to capture a bi-monthly and monthly rhythm in the stock movements, reflecting a shorter and longer-term trend momentum, respectively.\n\nTraders can alter these values to fit their trading style and goals, but the standard settings are a conventional industry starting point said to be well-suited for many market scenarios .",

            "The values of 12, 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the MACD, however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals. The 26d EMA is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter 12d EMA. If you used a 5d EMA and a 10d EMA then the 10d EMA would be considered the long MA. It is based on what you are comparing it with. Apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend, MACD can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend. What you look out for is divergence between the price and the MACD. See chart below of an example:  Here I have used 10d & 3d EMAs and 1 for the signal (as I did not want the signal to show up). I am simply using the MACD as a momentum indicator - which work by providing higher highs in the MACD with higher highs in price. This shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue. However the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the MACD. The green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the MACD, which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down. This could provide forewarning that the trend may be about to end and to take caution - i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss."

If your investments are in your local currency and your future expenses (usage of the returns on the investments) will be in your local currency FX has no effect. To answer your question, however, since all investments involve flows of money there can be no investment (other than perhaps gold which is really a form of currency) that isn't bound to at least one currency. In general investments are expected to be valued against the investor's home currency (I tend to call it \"\"fund currency\"\" as I work with hedge funds) as the return on the investment will be paid out in the fund currency and returns will be compared on the same basis. If investments are to be made internationally then it is necessary to reduce, or \"\"hedge\"\" the exchange rate risk. This is normally done using FX swaps or futures that allow an exchange rate in the future to be locked in today. Far from being unbound from FX moves these derivatives are closely bound to any moves but crucially are bound in the opposite direction to the hoped for FX move. an example of this would be if I'm investing 100GBP (my local currency) in a US company XYZ corp which I expect to do well. Suppose I get 200USD for my 100GBP and so buy 1 * 200USD shares in XYZ. No matter what happens to XYZ stock any move in GBP/USD will affect my P&L so I buy a future that allows me to exchange 200USD for 100GBP in 6 month's time. If GBP rises I can sell the future and make money on both the higher exchange rate and the increase in XYZ corp. If GBP falls I can keep the future until maturity and exchange the 200USD from XYZ corp for 100GBP so I only take the foreign exchange hit on any profits. If I expect my profits to be 10USD I can even buy futures such that I can lock in the exchange rate for 110USD in 6 months so that I will lose even less of my profit from the exchange rate move.\""

Speak with the HR department of your current employer to confirm that they will accept a rollover from another tax-deferred plan, as not all plans will agree to this. Obtain any necessary paperwork, ensuring you have details such as where the rollover check should be sent, and to whom it should be made payable.\n2.

        "answer": "If you are at the income limits for contributing directly to a Roth IRA and you're already participating in employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, one strategy to consider is making non-deductible Traditional IRA contributions followed by a conversion to a Roth IRA, often referred to as a \"backdoor Roth IRA contribution.\" This strategy involves contributing to a Traditional IRA\u2014without a tax deduction\u2014and then converting that IRA to a Roth IRA. If you don't have any previous pre-tax money in Traditional or other IRAs, the conversion to a Roth IRA can occur tax-free. It's important to note that you need to be mindful of pro-rata rules if you have other IRA funds that have not been taxed.\n\nAlso, under certain circumstances, if you have an existing IRA, you might be able to transfer IRA money into a 401(k), which could allow for the pretax deposits to be removed, leaving just the post-tax money available for a Roth conversion without additional tax implications . This approach is recommended when direct Roth IRA contributions are not viable due to income limits. \n\nPlease consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to ensure that this strategy aligns with your particular financial situation, and to understand all the implications, including any possible tax consequences, before proceeding.",

            "\"From the way you frame the question it sounds like you more or less know the answer already. Yes - you can make a non-deductable contribution to a traditional IRA and convert it to a Roth IRA. Here is Wikipedia's explanation: Regardless of income but subject to contribution limits, contributions can be made to a Traditional IRA and then converted to a Roth IRA.[10] This allows for \"\"backdoor\"\" contributions where individuals are able to avoid the income limitations of the Roth IRA. There is no limit to the frequency with which conversions can occur, so this process can be repeated indefinitely. One major caveat to the entire \"\"backdoor\"\" Roth IRA contribution process, however, is that it only works for people who do not have any pre-tax contributed money in IRA accounts at the time of the \"\"backdoor\"\" conversion to Roth; conversions made when other IRA money exists are subject to pro-rata calculations and may lead to tax liabilities on the part of the converter. [9] Do note the caveat in the second paragraph. This article explains it more thoroughly: The IRS does not allow converters to specify which dollars are being converted as they can with shares of stock being sold; for the purposes of determining taxes on conversions the IRS considers a person\u2019s non-Roth IRA money to be a single, co-mingled sum. Hence, if a person has any funds in any non-Roth IRA accounts, it is impossible to contribute to a Traditional IRA and then \u201cconvert that account\u201d to a Roth IRA as suggested by various pundits and the Wikipedia piece referenced above \u2013 conversions must be performed on a pro-rata basis of all IRA money, not on specific dollars or accounts. Say you have $20k of pre-tax assets in a traditional IRA, and make a non-deductable contribution of $5k. The account is now 80% pre-tax assets and 20% post-tax assets, so if you move $5k into a Roth IRA, $4k of it would be taxed in the conversion. The traditional IRA would be left with $16k of pre-tax assets and $4k of post-tax assets.\""

        "answer": "To close a futures position, a trader has several options:\n\n1. **Market Order**: This is an order sent to the exchange that will be filled immediately by being paired with a limit order on the opposite side of the market. If a trader wants to close a long position with a market order, they will sell their position at the current lowest available buy limit price.\n\n2. **Limit Order**: A limit order is placed on the books of the exchange at a price specified by the trader. To close a long position with a limit order, the trader specifies the price at or above which they are willing to sell. The position will only close if there is a matching market order that meets the limit price, and the trader's limit order becomes the lowest sell order on the book.\n\n3. **Offsetting Position**: A trader can also close a position by taking an opposite position in the market. This is known as \"selling to close\" for a long position and \"buying to close\" for a short position.\n\nThe exchange plays a role as an auction house that facilitates this process through an order book, but it does not actively seek out buyers and sellers. Instead, it allows the market participants to place orders which may then be paired by the order matching system .\n\nIt's worth noting that the exchanges treat orders to open a position and orders to close a position in the same way; they are all processed as 'buy' or 'sell' orders. Whether an order results in opening a new position or closing an existing one is relative to the trader's current holdings .\n\nIf a trader holds a futures contract until expiration, they will be responsible for delivering the contracted product at the contracted price unless the contract specifies cash settlement.

Assuming the contract is held until expiration, Trader A is responsible for delivering contracted product to Trader C for contracted price.  In reality this is generally settled up in cash, and Trader A and Trader C never even know each other's identity.\"",
            "\"Ignoring the complexities of a standardised and regulated market, a futures contract is simply a contract that requires party A to buy a given amount of a commodity from party B at a specified price. The future can be over something tangible like pork bellies or oil, in which case there is a physical transfer of \"\"stuff\"\" or it can be over something intangible like shares. The purpose of the contract is to allow the seller to \"\"lock-in\"\" a price so that they are not subject to price fluctuations between the date the contract is entered and the date it is complete; this risk is transferred to the seller who will therefore generally pay a discounted rate from the spot price on the original day. In many cases, the buyer actually wants the \"\"stuff\"\"; futures contracts between farmers and manufacturers being one example. The farmer who is growing, say, wool will enter a contract to supply 3000kg at $10 per kg (of a given quality etc. there are generally price adjustments detailed for varying quality) with a textile manufacturer to be delivered in 6 months. The spot price today may be $11 - the farmer gives up $1 now to shift the risk of price fluctuations to the manufacturer. When the strike date rolls around the farmer delivers the 3000kg and takes the money - if he has failed to grow at least 3000kg then he must buy it from someone or trigger whatever the penalty clauses in the contract are. For futures over shares and other securities the principle is exactly the same. Say the contract is for 1000 shares of XYZ stock. Party A agrees to sell these for $10 each on a given day to party B. When that day rolls around party A transfers the shares and gets the money. Party A may have owned the shares all along, may have bought them before the settlement day or, if push comes to shove, must buy them on the day of settlement. Notwithstanding when they bought them, if they paid less than $10 they make a profit if they pay more they make a loss.  Generally speaking, you can't settle a futures contract with another futures contract - you have to deliver up what you promised - be it wool or shares.\"",
            "For exchange contracts, yes. A trader can close a position by taking an offsetting position. CME's introduction to Futures explains it quite well (on page 22).  Exiting the Market Jack entered the market on the buy side,   speculating that the S&P 500 futures price would move higher. He has   three choices for exiting the market:",
            "Futures exchanges are essentially auction houses facilitating a two-way auction. While they provide a venue for buyers and sellers to come together and transact (be that a physical venue such as a pit at the CME or an electronic network such as Globex), they don't actively seek out or find buyers and sellers to pair them together. The exchanges enable this process through an order book. As a futures trader you may submit one of two types of order to an exchange: Market Order - this is sent to the exchange and is filled immediately by being paired with a limit order.   Limit Order - this is placed on the books of the exchange at the price you specify. If other participants enter opposing market orders at this price, then their market order will be paired with your limit order. In your example, trader B wishes to close his long position. To do this he may enter a market sell order, which will immediately close his position at the lowest possible buy limit price, or he may enter a limit sell order, specifying the price at or above which he is willing to sell. In the case of the limit order, he will only sell and successfully close his position if his order becomes the lowest sell order on the book. All this may be a lot easier to understand by looking at a visual image of an order book such as the one given in the explanation that I have published here: Stop Orders for Futures Finally, not that as far as the exchange is concerned, there is no difference between an order to open and an order to close a position. They're all just 'buy' or 'sell' orders. Whether they cause you to reduce/exit a position or increase/establish a position is relative to the position you currently hold; if you're flat a buy order establishes a new position, if you're short it closes your position and leaves you flat."

        "question": "Net loss not distributed by mutual funds to their shareholders?",
        "answer": "Net losses realized by a mutual fund from the sale of securities are not directly distributed to shareholders. Instead, these losses are retained by the mutual fund and can be used to offset any future capital gains before distributions are made. Shareholders do not receive a Form 1099-DIV for a net loss; they cannot declare a loss to the IRS or deduct it on their income tax returns for that year. The loss will reduce the mutual fund's net asset value, which is reflected in the reduced share price.\n\nWhen shareholders sell their mutual fund shares, they will realize a capital gain or loss based on the difference between the sale proceeds and their cost basis in the shares. At the time of the sale, the gain or loss will be reported on Form 1099-B and can be declared on Schedule D of Form 1040. Only then can shareholders use the losses to offset gains or deduct up to $3,000 in a year, with the ability to carry forward remaining losses to future years.\n\nInternally, the mutual fund keeps track of these losses and uses them to offset its gains, effectively reducing the amount of taxable income distributed to shareholders in future years as capital gains distributions. When the mutual fund does make such distributions, they are reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV in subsequent years .",
        "ground_truth": [
            "When you invest (say $1000) in (say 100 shares) of a mutual fund at $10 per share, and the price of the shares changes,  you do not have a capital gain or loss, and you do not have to declare anything to the IRS or make any entry on any line on Form 1040 or tell anyone else about it either. You can brag about it at parties if the share price has gone up, or weep bitter tears into your cocktail if the price has gone down, but the IRS not only does not care, but it will not let you deduct the paper loss or pay taxes on the paper gain.  What you put down on Form 1040 Schedules B   and D is precisely what the mutual fund will tell you on   Form 1099-DIV (and Form 1099-B), no more, no less. If you did not report any of these amounts on your previous   tax returns, you need to file amended tax returns, both   Federal as well as State, A stock mutual fund invests in stocks and the fund manager may buy and sell some stocks during the course of the year. If he makes a profit, that money will be distributed to the share holders of the mutual fund. That money can be re-invested in more shares of the same mutual fund or taken as cash  (and possibly invested in some other fund). This  capital gain distribution is reported to you on Form 1099-DIV and you have to report sit on your tax return even if you re-invested in more share of the same mutual fund, and the amount of the distribution is taxable income to you. Similarly, if the stocks owned by the mutual fund pay dividends, those will be passed on to you as a dividend distribution and all the above still applies. You can choose to reinvest, etc, the amount will be reported to you on Form 1099-DIV, and you need to report it to the IRS and include it in your taxable income. If the mutual fund manager loses money in the buying and selling he will not tell you that he lost money but it will be visible as a reduction in the price of the shares. The loss will not be reported to you on Form 1099-DIV and you cannot do anything about it.  Especially important, you cannot declare to the IRS that you have a loss and you cannot deduct the loss on your income tax returns that year. When you finally sell your shares in the mutual fund, you will have a gain or loss that you can pay taxes on or deduct. Say the mutual fund paid a dividend of $33 one year and you re-invested the money into the mutual fund, buying 3 shares at the then cost of $11 per share. You declare the $33 on your tax return that year and pay taxes on it. Two years later, you sell all 103 shares that you own for $10.50 per share.  Your total investment was $1000 + $33 = $1033. You get $1081.50 from the fund, and you will owe taxes on $1081.50 - $1033 = $48.50. You have a profit of $50 on the 100 shares originally bought and a loss of $1.50 on the 3 shares bought for $11: the net result is a gain of $48.50. You do not pay taxes on $81.50 as the profit from your original $1000 investment; you pay taxes only on $48.50 (remember that you already paid taxes on the $33). The mutual fund will report on Form 1099-B that you sold 103 shares for $1081.50 and that you bought the 103 shares for  an average price of $1033/103 = $10.029 per share. The difference is taxable income to you. If you sell the 103 shares for $9 per share (say),   then you get $927 out of an investment of $1033 for   a capital loss of $106. This will be reported to you   on Form 1099-B and you will enter the amounts on   Schedule D of Form 1040 as a capital loss. What you actually pay taxes on is the net capital gain, if any, after combining all your capital gains and losses for the year. If the net is a loss, you can deduct up to $3000 in a year, and carry the rest  forward to later years to offset capital gains in later years. But, your unrealized capital gains or losses (those that occur because the mutual fund share price goes up and down like a yoyo while you grin or grit your teeth and hang on to your shares) are not reported or deducted or taxed anywhere. It is more complicated when you don't sell all the shares you own in the mutual fund or if you sell shares within one year of buying them, but let's stick to simple cases.",
            "\"I'll try to answer using your original example.  First, let me restate your assumptions, slightly modified: The mutual fund has: Note that I say the \"\"mutual fund has\"\" those gains and losses. That's because they occur inside the mutual fund and not directly to you as a shareholder. I use \"\"realized\"\" gains and losses because the only gains and losses handled this way are those causes by actual asset (stock) sales within the fund (as directed by fund management).  Changes in the value of fund holdings that are not sold are not included in this. As a holder of the fund, you learn the values of X, Y, and Z after the end of the year when the fund management reports the values.  For gains, you will also typically see the values reported on your 1099-DIV under \"\"capital gains distributions\"\".  For example, your 1099-DIV for year 3 will have the value Z for capital gains (besides reporting any ordinary dividends in another box).   Your year 1 1099 will have $0 \"\"capital gains distributions\"\" shown because of the rule you highlighted in bold: net realized losses are not distributed.  This capital loss however can later be used to the mutual fund holder's tax advantage.  The fund's internal accounting carries forward the loss, and uses it to offset later realized gains.  Thus your year 2 1099 will have a capital gain distribution of (Y-X), not Y, thus recognizing the loss which occurred. Thus the loss is taken into account.  Note that for capital gains you, the holder, pay no tax in year 1, pay tax in year 2 on Y-X, and pay tax in year 3 on Z. All the above is the way it works whether or not you sell the shares immediately after the end of year 3 or you hold the shares for many more years.  Whenever you do sell the shares, you will have a gain or loss, but that is different from the fund's realized losses we have been talking about (X, Y, and Z).\""

        "question": "Pay off credit card debt or earn employer 401(k) match?",
        "answer": "The decision to pay off credit card debt versus earning an employer 401(k) match depends on several factors, including the interest rate on your credit card debt, the return on investment (ROI) of the 401(k) including the employer match, and your personal financial situation and behavior.\n\nThe document outlines two perspectives:\n\n1. One point of view suggests that if you are very committed to paying off debt and have eliminated non-essential spending, then the psychological and financial freedom gained from paying off the credit card debt may be worth more than potential gains from the employer match, especially in the short term. Dave Ramsey's teaching is cited as an example of focusing intensely on one financial goal at a time to make better progress .\n\n2. The other perspective strongly advises contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, because it's often an unparalleled investment opportunity, akin to an immediate 100% ROI. This is particularly notable if the match is dollar for dollar. The counterargument to opting out of the 401(k) is only considered viable if you're in a position where you need to choose between making minimum payments on debts or receiving the match. Otherwise, the mathematical advantage of receiving a 401(k) match is compelling, especially when considering the compounded growth over time .\n\nThe document includes an elaborate example comparing the decision mathematically:\n\n- Paying off $1000 of credit card debt at a 20% interest rate will save you $200 in interest after one year, which is a 20% ROI, and potentially a much higher ROI over 30 years due to compound interest.\n- Investing $1000 in a 401(k) with an expected ROI of 5% without any employer match will result in a 5% ROI after one year, and substantially more after 30 years due to compounding.\n- If there is a 50% match, the ROI after one year is 57%, and with a full match, it's 110%, reflecting the immediate benefit of the employer contribution .\n\nUltimately, it is crucial to consider the interest rate on your credit card debt and the specifics of your employer's 401(k) match. In most cases, as long as you can manage your payments responsibly and you've taken control of spending behaviors that led to debt accumulation, it is generally advisable to take advantage of the employer match in your 401(k) while also working on paying off high-interest debts .",

            "A matching pension scheme is like free money. No wait, it actually IS free money. You are literally earning 100% interest rate on that money the instant you pay it in to the account. That money would have to sit in your credit card account for at least five years to earn that kind of return; five years in which the pension money would have earned an additional return over and above the 100%. Mathematically there is no contest that contributing to a matching pension scheme is one of the best investment there is. You should always do it. Well, almost always. When should you not do it?",
            "Nope, take the match.  I cannot see not taking the match unless you don't have enough money to cover the bills. Every situation is different of course, and if the option is to missing minimum payments or other bills in order to get the match, make your payments.  But in all other circumstances, take the match. My reasoning is, it is hard enough to earn money so take every chance you can.  If you save for retirement in the process, all the better.",
            "\"For easy math, say you are in the 25% tax bracket. A thousand deposited dollars is $750 out of your pocket, but $2000 after the match.  Now, you say you want to take the $750 and pay down the card. If you wait a year (at 20%) you'll owe $900, but have access to borrow a full $1000, at a low rate, 4% or so. The payment is less than $19/mo for 5 years.  So long as one is comfortable juggling their debt a bit, the impact of a fully matched 401(k) cannot be beat. Keep in mind, this is a different story than those who just say \"\"don't take a 401(k) loan.\"\" Here, it's the loan that offers you the chance to fund the account. If you are let go, and withdraw the money, even at the 25% rate, you net $1500 less the $200 penalty, or $1300 compared to the $750 you are out of pocket. If you don't want to take the loan, you're still ahead so long as you are able to pay the cards over a reasonable time. I'll admit, a 20% card paid over 10+ years can still trash a 100% return. This is why I add the 401(k) loan to the mix.  The question for you - jldugger - is how tight is the budget? And how much is the match? Is it dollar for dollar on first X%?\"",

Otherwise, if you don't have a handle on the behaviors that got you there, you're just going to get more rope to hang yourself with.  I.e., makes sense to take a low-interest home equity loan to pay off high-interest credit card debt, but more likely than not, you'll just re-rack up the debt on the cards because you never fixed the behavior that put you into debt. Same thing here, if you opt not to contribute to \"\"pay off the cards\"\" without fixing the debt-accumulating behaviors, what you're going to do is stay in debt AND not provide for retirement. Take the match until you're certain you have your debt accumulation habits in check.\"",
            "I'd take the match, but I wouldn't contribute beyond your match, for two reasons:",
            "Mathwise, I absolutely agree with the other answers.  No contest, you should keep getting the match.  But, just for completeness, I'll give a contrarian opinion that is generally not very popular, but does have some merit.   If you can focus on just one main financial goal at a time, and throw every extra dollar you have at that one focus (i.e., getting out of debt, in your case), you will make better progress than if you're trying to do too many things at once.  Also, there something incredibly freeing about being out of debt that has other beneficial impacts on your life. So, if you can bring a lot of focus to the credit card debt and get it paid off quickly, it may be worth deferring the 401(k) investing long enough to do that, even though it doesn't make as much mathematical sense.  (This is essentially what Dave Ramsey teaches, BTW.)",
            "I would definitely be putting in enough to get the most out of the match.  Only reasons I can think of not too would be: Other than that, not investing in the 401(k) is turning down free money. Edit based on feedback in comments. The only time I would advocate number 1 is if you are intensely committed to getting out of debt, were on a very tight budget and had eliminated all non-essential spending. In that situation only, I think the mental benefit of having that last debt paid off would be worth more than a few dollars in interest.",
            "\"There is a very simple calculation that will answer the question: Is the expected ROI of the 401K including the match greater than the interest rate of your credit card? Some assumptions that don't affect the calculation, but do help illustrate the points. You have 30 years until you can pull out the 401K. Your credit card interest rate is 20% compounded annually.  The minimum payoffs are being disregarded, because that would legally just force a certain percentage to credit card. You only have $1000.  You can either pay off your credit card or invest, but not both.  For most people, this isn't the case.  Ideally, you would simply forego $1000 worth of spending, AND DO BOTH  Worked Example: Pay $1000 in Credit Card Debt, at 20% interest.   After 1 year, if you pay off that debt, you no longer owe $1200.  ROI = 20% (Duh!) After 30 years, you no longer owe (and this is pretty amazing) $237,376.31.  ROI = 23,638% In all cases, the ROI is GUARANTEED. Invest $1000 in matching 401k, with expected ROI of 5%. 2a. For illustration purposes, let's assume no match After 1 year, you have $1050 ($1000 principal, $0 match, 5% interest) - but you can't take it out. ROI = 5% After 30 years, you have $4321.94, ROI of 332% - assuming away all risk. 2b. Then, we'll assume a 50% match. After 1 year, you have $1575 ($1000 principle, $500 match, 5% interest) - but you can't take it out. ROI = 57% - but you are  stuck for a bit After 30 years, you have $6482.91, ROI of 548% - assuming away all risk. 2c. Finally, a full match After 1 year, you have $2100 ($1000 principle, $1000 match, 5% interest) - but you can't take it out. ROI = 110% - but again, you are stuck. After 30 years, you have $8643.89, ROI of 764% - assuming away all risk. Here's the summary - The interest rate is really all that matters.  Paying off a credit card is a guaranteed investment.   The only reason not to pay off a 20% credit card interest rate is if, after taxes, time, etc..., you could earn more than 20% somewhere else.   Note that at 1 year, the matching funds of a 401k, in all cases where the match exceeded 20%, beat the credit card. If you could take that money before you could have paid off the credit card, it would have been a good deal. The problem with the 401k is that you can't realize that gain until you retire. Credit Card debt, on the other hand, keeps growing until you pay it off. As such, paying off your credit card debt - assuming its interest rate is greater than the stock market (which trust me, it almost always is) - is the better deal. Indeed, with the exception of tax advantaged mortgages, there is almost no debt that has an interest rate than is \"\"better\"\" than the market.\""

        "question": "Short Term Capital Gains tax vs. IRA Withdrawal Tax w/o Quarterly Est. Taxes",
        "answer": "In the United States, short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates, which vary depending on your income bracket. On the other hand, when you withdraw money from an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), the amount is typically taxed as ordinary income as well. However, there's a key difference: if you withdraw from an IRA before age 59\u00bd, you may incur an additional 10% early withdrawal penalty, making the withdrawal more costly than realizing short-term capital gains.\n\nFor example, if you are in the 25% tax bracket, your short-term capital gains would be taxed at 25%. However, an early withdrawal from an IRA would be taxed at your marginal rate plus the 10% penalty (in this case, a total of 35%). Another important distinction is that withdrawing from an IRA makes the entire amount taxable, whereas with a taxable account, only the gains are taxable, as the original investment has already been taxed.\n\nRegarding the quarterly estimated taxes, the IRS does not bill taxpayers quarterly. Instead, individuals must determine if they owe estimated taxes throughout the year based on their income, including both capital gains and IRA withdrawals. If not enough tax is withheld to cover one's liability, estimated tax payments may be necessary to avoid a penalty. It's worth noting that taxes are typically withheld from IRA distributions, but if they aren't, the tax owed would need to be paid as estimated tax .\n\nPlease remember, this information is not legal or financial advice but a general explanation based on the document provided. For specific advice regarding your situation, consider consulting with a tax professional or financial advisor.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "\"There is not a special rate for short-term capital gains.  Only long-term gains have a special rate.  Short-term gains are taxed at your ordinary-income rate (see here).  Hence if you're in the 25% bracket, your short-term gain would be taxed at 25%.  The IRA withdrawal, as you already mentioned, would be taxed at 25%, plus a 10% penalty, for 35% total.  Thus the bite on the IRA withdrawal is larger than that on a non-IRA withdrawal. As for the estimated tax issue, I don't think there will be a significant difference there.  The reason is that (traditional) IRA withdrawals count as ordinary taxable income (see here).  This means that, when you withdraw the funds from your IRA, you will increase your income.  If that increase pushes you too far beyond what your withholding is accounting for, then you owe estimated tax.  In other words, whether you get the money by selling stocks in a taxable account or by withdrawing them from an IRA, you still increase your taxable income, and thus potentially expose yourself to the estimated tax obligation. (In fact, there may be a difference.  As you note, you will pay tax at the capital gains rate on gains from selling in a taxable account.  But if you sell the stocks inside the IRA and withdraw, that is ordinary income.  However, since ordinary income is taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains, you will potentially pay more tax on the IRA withdrawal, since it will be taxed at the higher rate, if your gains are long-term rather than short term.  This is doubly true if you withdraw early, incurring the extra 10% penalty.  See this question for some more discussion of this issue.) In addition, I think you may be somewhat misunderstanding the nature of estimated tax.  The IRS will not \"\"ask\"\" you for a quarterly estimated tax when you sell stock.  The IRS does not monitor your activity and send you a bill each quarter.  They may indeed check whether your reported income jibes with info they received from your bank, etc., but they'll still do that regardless of whether you got that income by selling in a taxable account or withdrawing money from an IRA, because both of those increase your taxable income. Quarterly estimated tax is not an extra tax; it is just you paying your normal income tax over the course of the year instead of all at once.  If your withholdings will not cover enough of your tax liability, you must figure that out yourself and pay the estimated tax (see here); if you don't do so, you may be assessed a penalty.  It doesn't matter how you got the money; if your taxable income is too high relative to your withheld tax, then you have to pay the estimated tax.  Typically tax will be withheld from your IRA distribution, but if it's not withheld, you'll still owe it as estimated tax.\"",
            "\"Bottom line is this: there's no \"\"short term capital gains tax\"\" in the US. There's only long term capital gains tax, which is lower than the regular (aka ordinary) tax rates. Short term capital gains are taxed using the ordinary tax rates, depending on your bracket. So if you're in the 25% bracket - your short term gains are taxed at 25%. You're describing two options: For the case #1 you'll pay 25% tax (your marginal rate) + 10% penalty (flat rate), total 35%. For the case #2 you'll pay 25% tax (your marginal rate) + 0% penalty. Total 25%. Thus, by withdrawing from IRA you'll be 10% worse than by realizing capital gains. In addition, if you need $10K - taking it from IRA will make the whole amount taxable. While realizing capital gains from a taxable account will make only the gains taxable, the original investment amount is yours and had been taxed before. So not only there's a 10% difference in the tax rate, there's also a significant difference in the amount being taxed. Thus, withdrawing from IRA is generally not a good idea, and you will never be better off with withdrawing from IRA than with cashing out taxable investments (from tax perspective).

That's when you have that 3am heart attack, and you get out a pad of paper and write \"\"I rescind all former wills hereby bequeathing everything to my mistress Samantha, and as to the rest of you go rot in hell. \"\" One issue with these is that they have to get to court somehow, and someone has to verify the handwriting, and there are often state laws about excluding a current spouse, so you can guess for yourself whether that one might disappear in the fireplace when another family member finds it next to the body or if a court would give it validity. And there can be logic or grammar problems with do it yourself wills, made in your own handwriting, without experience or good references on how to write things out.  Lawyers who have done a bunch of these know what is clear and makes sense.  (1) In Tennessee, where I live, an intestate's property, someone who died with no will, is divided according to the law.  The law looks to find a spouse or relatives to divide the property, before considering giving it to the state.  That might be fine for some people.  It happened once in my family, and was resolved in court with minimal red tape.  But it really depends on the person.  Someone in the middle of an unfinalized divorce, for instance, probably needs a will help to sort out who gets what.   (2) A form will is valid in Tennessee if it is witnessed properly.  That means two witnesses, who sign in yours' and each others' presence.  In theory they can be called to testify that the signature is valid.  In practice, I don't know if this happens as I am not a lawyer. I have found it difficult to find witnesses who will sign a form will, and it is disconcerting to have to ask friends or coworkers for this sort of favor as most people learn never to sign anything without reading it.  But a lawyer often has secretaries that do it...  There is a procedure and a treaty for international wills, which I know about from living overseas. To streamline things, you can get the witnesses to each sign an affidavit after they signed the will.  The affidavit is sworn written testimony of what happened, that they saw the person sign their will and sign in each others' presence, when, where, no duress, etc.  If done correctly, this can be sufficient to prove the will without calling on witnesses.  There is another option (3) you arrange your affairs so that most of your funds are disbursed by banks or brokers holding your accounts.  Option (3) is really cheap, most stock brokers and banks will create a Transfer-On-Death notice on your account for free.  The problem with this is that you also need to write out a letter that explains to your heirs how to get this money, and you need to make sure that they will get the letter if you are dead.  Also, you can't deal with physical goods or appoint a guardian for children this way.  The advantage of a lawyer is that you know the document is correct and according to local law and custom, and also the lawyer might provide additional services like storing the will in his safe.  You can get personalized help that you can not get with a form or computer program.\""
